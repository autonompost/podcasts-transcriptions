The following is a conversation with Josje Bach, his third time on this podcast.

00:04.160 --> 00:07.840
Josje is one of the most brilliant and fascinating minds in the world,

00:07.840 --> 00:11.520
exploring the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and computation.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.440
And he's one of my favorite humans to talk to about pretty much anything and everything.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.040
And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.120
It's the best way to support this podcast. We've got Numerai for the world's hardest

00:27.120 --> 00:33.680
data science tournament, 8Sleep for naps, Masterclass for learning, and AG1 for health,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.680
choose wisely, my friends. Also, if you want to work with our amazing team,

00:37.680 --> 00:41.200
we're always hiring, go to lexfreedman.com slash hiring.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.720
And now, onto the full ad reads. As always, no ads in the middle.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.360
I try to make this interesting, but if you must skip them,

00:47.360 --> 00:50.800
please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will, too.

00:50.800 --> 00:57.760
This show is brought to you by Numerai, a hedge fund that uses AI and machine learning to make

00:57.760 --> 01:04.000
investment decisions. It's basically a super difficult machine learning tournament that uses

01:04.000 --> 01:11.120
real data and people's submitted models that try to predict the market. I love difficult

01:11.120 --> 01:17.360
real world data sets. You may know that for a long time and still, I've been interested in

01:17.360 --> 01:23.760
real world robotics. One of the largest scale deployment of real world robotics is autonomous

01:23.760 --> 01:29.360
vehicles. Autonomous driving and semi-autonomous driving, the stakes are very high. The same is

01:29.360 --> 01:34.720
true for financial markets. It's really interesting that Numerai presents to you

01:34.720 --> 01:40.080
the real world data of financial markets and presents you an easy accessible mechanism by

01:40.080 --> 01:45.280
which to test, deploy, and compete with others in this kind of data set. It's a really great

01:45.280 --> 01:50.880
way, if you're interested in data science and machine learning, to learn, to compete,

01:50.880 --> 01:57.840
to have fun, all that kind of stuff. Head over to numer.ai.lex to sign up for a tournament

01:57.840 --> 02:04.480
and hone your machine learning skills. That's numer.ai.lex for a chance to play against me

02:04.480 --> 02:11.440
and win a share of the tournament's prize pool. This episode is also brought to you by 8 Sleep

02:11.520 --> 02:18.800
and its new Pi3 mattress. In the scorching Texas heat, the thing I go to escape, to escape nature

02:19.440 --> 02:24.320
are the external harsh conditions of nature and going to the nature of my own mind.

02:25.200 --> 02:32.400
Wherever that weird and beautiful dream world is, the place that has no rules, no boundaries,

02:33.600 --> 02:40.400
no limits, no physics, no constraints on what is possible and what is impossible.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.840
The dream world that we go to, what is that world? It's the same world as imagination.

02:47.840 --> 02:54.880
It's such a fascinating world. The human mind, its capabilities are just so incredibly fascinating,

02:54.880 --> 03:00.560
and one of the ways to explore that is to dream. But it's the return from the dream world that is

03:00.560 --> 03:06.400
the most refreshing to me. That's why I love naps. It's a quick stroll through the dream world and

03:06.400 --> 03:13.360
your back and taking on the challenges of the day in the here and now. Anyway, if you're into

03:13.360 --> 03:18.800
naps as much as me, you should check out 8 Sleep and you'll get special savings when you go to

03:18.800 --> 03:27.520
8sleep.com. This show is also brought to you by Masterclass. $10 a month gets you an all-access

03:27.520 --> 03:32.480
pass to watch courses from the best people in the world in their respective disciplines.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.640
The list of courses I've personally watched and enjoyed just lasts forever, but they have

03:39.600 --> 03:44.640
everybody and anybody you ever want to listen to. I've listened to Martin Scorsese, Tony Hogg,

03:44.640 --> 03:50.320
Jane Goodall, Neil Gaiman, Daniel Negron before I interviewed him, Garry Kasparov,

03:50.320 --> 03:55.360
Carlos Santana, Will Wright, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Chris Hadfield. The list is incredible.

03:55.360 --> 04:01.360
I'm a huge believer that learning about a thing, at least part of learning about a thing,

04:01.360 --> 04:07.120
should involve learning or listening to the best people in the world at that thing.

04:08.400 --> 04:13.680
It's not only the advice they give, it's not only the analysis or the description

04:13.680 --> 04:22.640
of how they approach the thing, but in the way they see life, in the way they carry themselves

04:22.640 --> 04:28.480
physically and mentally. You get to watch Mastery and it's so beautiful that human beings are able

04:28.480 --> 04:35.440
to reach the very top of excellence and sometimes break through the boundaries,

04:35.440 --> 04:40.240
the limits of what was thought possible before, and it's just beautiful to watch those humans.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.760
It's beautiful, it's inspiring, it's great to celebrate that, it's great to learn from that.

04:46.320 --> 04:50.400

04:56.720 --> 05:03.920
This show is brought to you by AG1. Their all-in-one daily drink brings happiness to me,

05:04.400 --> 05:10.160
and daily for me is twice daily. It brings happiness, health, and ensures that all the

05:10.160 --> 05:15.920
crazy physical and mental stuff I do is built on a foundation of basic nutritional health.

05:15.920 --> 05:22.880
It's the super multivitamin that I use. It also is one of the components of daily habits

05:23.280 --> 05:32.240
that I have in my life, and so whenever I do this thing, I feel grounded. I feel happy. I feel like

05:32.240 --> 05:36.000
I have my life together. So you could do that both at home and with the travel packs when you're

05:36.000 --> 05:42.880
traveling. In fact, it's one of the things that makes me feel like I'm at home when I'm traveling.

05:42.880 --> 05:50.640
I'll drink an AG1 and it'll feel good. It'll put a smile on my face. It's green, it tastes delicious,

05:50.640 --> 05:55.280
it's green, it tastes delicious. What else do you want? They'll give you a one month supply

05:55.280 --> 06:03.840
of fish oil when you sign up at drinkag1.com slash lex. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

06:03.840 --> 06:08.560
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

06:08.560 --> 06:11.760
here's Josje Bach.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.840
You wrote a post about levels of lucidity.

06:31.920 --> 06:37.120
As we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually

06:37.120 --> 06:42.480
accumulating ideas about itself, but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages.

06:43.840 --> 06:49.680
There are seven of the stages. Stage one, reactive survival, infant. Stage two, personal self,

06:49.680 --> 06:57.120
young child. Stage three, social self, adolescence, domesticated adult. Stage four is rational agency,

06:57.120 --> 07:03.920
self-direction. Stage five is self-authoring. That's full adult. You've achieved wisdom,

07:03.920 --> 07:09.920
but there's two more stages. Stage six is enlightenment. Stage seven is transcendence.

07:09.920 --> 07:15.360
Can you explain each or the interesting parts of each of these stages? And what's your sense

07:15.360 --> 07:23.040
why there are stages of this, of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short life?

07:23.680 --> 07:32.160
This model is derived from a concept by the psychologist Robert Keegan. And he talks about

07:32.880 --> 07:37.760
the development of the self as a process that happens in principle by some kind of

07:37.760 --> 07:41.920
reverse engineering of a mind where you gradually become aware of yourself and thereby build

07:41.920 --> 07:48.160
structure that allows you to interact deeper with the world and yourself. And I found myself using

07:48.160 --> 07:52.880
this model not so much as a developmental model. I'm not even sure if it's a very good developmental

07:52.880 --> 07:59.760
model because I saw my children not progressing exactly like that. And I also suspect that

07:59.760 --> 08:04.000
you don't go through these stages necessarily in succession. And it's not that you work through

08:04.000 --> 08:08.960
one stage and then you get into the next one. Sometimes you revisit them. Sometimes stuff is

08:08.960 --> 08:14.160
happening in parallel. But it's, I think, a useful framework to look at what's present and the

08:14.160 --> 08:17.840
structure of a person and how they interact with the world and how they relate to themselves.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.440
So it's more like a philosophical framework that allows you to talk about how minds work.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.160
And at first, when we are born, we don't have a personal self yet, I think.

08:28.960 --> 08:34.000
Instead, we have an attentional self. And this attentional self is initially in the infant task

08:34.000 --> 08:38.800
is building a world model and also an initial model of the self. But mostly it's building a

08:38.800 --> 08:46.320
game engine in the brain that is tracking sensory data and uses it to explain it. And in some sense,

08:46.320 --> 08:50.640
you could compare it to a game engine like Minecraft or so. So colors and sounds,

08:51.760 --> 08:56.080
people are all not physical objects. They are creation of our mind at a certain level of

08:56.080 --> 09:04.960
core screening, models that are mathematical that use geometry and that use manipulation of

09:04.960 --> 09:10.480
objects and so on to create scenes in which we can find ourselves and interact with them.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.200
So Minecraft.

09:12.080 --> 09:18.000
And this personal self is something that is more or less created after the world is finished,

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
after it's trained into the system, after it has been constructed. And this personal self is an

09:24.000 --> 09:29.840
agent that interacts with the outside world. And the outside world is not the world of quantum

09:29.840 --> 09:34.960
mechanics, not the physical universe, but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.

09:35.760 --> 09:41.040
And this is us and we experience ourselves interacting with that outside world that is

09:41.040 --> 09:47.760
created inside of our own mind. And outside of our self, there are feelings and they presented

09:47.760 --> 09:52.640
our interface to this outside world. They pose problems to us. These feelings are basically

09:52.640 --> 09:57.920
attitudes that our mind is computing that tell us what's needed in the world, the things that

09:57.920 --> 10:04.160
we are drawn to, the things that we are afraid of. And we are tasked with solving this problem of

10:04.160 --> 10:09.920
satisfying the needs, avoiding the aversions, following on our inner commitments and so on,

10:09.920 --> 10:16.000
and also modeling ourselves and building the next stage. So after we have this personal self and

10:16.000 --> 10:22.320
stage two online, many people form a social self. And this social self allows the individual to

10:22.320 --> 10:28.240
experience themselves as part of a group. It's basically this thing that when you are playing

10:28.240 --> 10:33.360
in a team, for instance, you don't notice yourself just as a single node that is reaching out into

10:33.360 --> 10:37.840
the world, but you're also looking down. You're looking down from this entire group and you see

10:37.840 --> 10:42.320
how this group is looking at this individual. And everybody in the group is in some sense,

10:42.320 --> 10:48.000
emulating this group spirit to some degree. And in this state, people are forming their opinions

10:48.000 --> 10:52.880
by assimilating them from this group mind. They basically gain the ability to act a little bit

10:52.880 --> 10:58.960
like a hive mind. But are you also modeling the interaction of how opinions shapes and forms

10:58.960 --> 11:05.280
through the interaction of the individual nodes within the group? Yeah, the way in which people

11:05.280 --> 11:11.040
do it in this stage is that they experience what are the opinions of my environment. They

11:11.040 --> 11:16.320
experience the relationship that I have to their environment and they resonate with people around

11:16.320 --> 11:23.760
them and get more opinions through this interaction, the way in which they relate to others.

11:24.560 --> 11:29.760
And at stage four, you basically understand that stuff is true and false independently,

11:29.760 --> 11:34.160
what other people believe. And you have agency over your own beliefs in that stage. You basically

11:34.160 --> 11:40.720
discover epistemology, the rules about determining what's true and false. So you start to learn how

11:40.720 --> 11:46.800
to think. Yes. I mean, at some level, you're always thinking, you are constructing things.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.280
And I believe that this ability to reason about your mental representation is what we mean by

11:51.280 --> 11:56.800
thinking. It's an intrinsically reflexive process that requires consciousness. Without consciousness,

11:56.800 --> 12:02.240
you cannot think. You can generate the content of feelings and so on outside of consciousness.

12:02.240 --> 12:07.280
It's very hard to be conscious of how your feelings emerge, at least in the early stages

12:07.280 --> 12:13.680
of development. But thoughts is something that you always control. And if you are a nerd like me,

12:14.480 --> 12:19.600
you often have to skip stage three because you lack the intuitive empathy with others.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.320
Because in order to resonate with a group, you need to have a quite similar architecture.

12:24.320 --> 12:30.240
And if people are via differently, then it's hard for them to resonate with other people and

12:30.240 --> 12:36.720
basically have empathy, which is not the same as compassion, but it is a shared perceptual mental

12:36.720 --> 12:42.720
state. Empathy happens not just via inference about the mental states of others, but it's

12:42.720 --> 12:47.440
a perception of what other people feel and where they're at. Can't you not have empathy

12:48.000 --> 12:52.080
while also not having a similar architecture, cognitive architecture, as the others in the group?

12:52.080 --> 12:56.640
I think, yes. But you often, well, I experienced that too. But you need to build something that

12:56.640 --> 13:01.440
is like a meta architecture. You need to be able to embrace the architecture of the other to some

13:01.440 --> 13:08.160
degree or find some shared common ground. And it's also this issue that if you are a nerd,

13:08.160 --> 13:12.560
normies often, basically neurotypical people, have difficulty to resonate with you.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.280
And as a result, they have difficulty understanding you unless they have enough

13:17.280 --> 13:22.000
wisdom to feel what's going on there. Well, isn't the whole process of the stage

13:22.000 --> 13:27.040
three to figure out the API to the other humans that have different architecture and

13:27.600 --> 13:34.400
you yourself publish public documentation for the API that people can interact with for you?

13:35.280 --> 13:39.920
Isn't this the whole process of socializing? My experience as a child growing up was that

13:40.480 --> 13:46.080
I did not find any way to interface with the stage three people. And they didn't do that with me.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.920
Did you try?

13:47.920 --> 13:52.800
Yeah, of course, I tried it very hard. But it was only when I entered a mathematics school

13:52.800 --> 13:59.200
at ninth grade, lots of other nerds were present, that I found people that I could

13:59.200 --> 14:05.200
deeply resonate with and had the impression that, yes, I have friends now. I found my own people.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.360
And before that, I felt extremely lonely in the world. There was basically nobody I could connect

14:09.360 --> 14:18.880
to. And I remember there was one moment in all these years where there was a school exchange

14:18.880 --> 14:24.640
and it was a Russian boy, a kid from the Russian garrison stationed in eastern Germany who visited

14:24.640 --> 14:29.840
our school. And we played a game of chess against each other. And we looked into each other's eyes

14:29.840 --> 14:34.080
and we sat there for two hours playing this game of chess. And I had the impression this is a human

14:34.080 --> 14:39.440
being. He understands what I understand. We didn't even speak the same language.

14:40.320 --> 14:46.960
I wonder if your life could have been different if you knew that it's okay to be different,

14:46.960 --> 14:53.440
to have a different architecture, whether accepting that the interface is hard to figure out,

14:53.440 --> 14:57.360
takes a long time to figure out, and it's okay to be different. In fact, it's beautiful to be different.

15:01.440 --> 15:07.760
It was not my main concern. My main concern was mostly that I was alone. It was not so much the

15:07.760 --> 15:13.920
question, is it okay to be the way I am? I couldn't do much about it, so I had to deal with it.

15:13.920 --> 15:20.080
But my main issue was that I was not sure if I would ever meet anybody growing up

15:20.960 --> 15:24.800
that I would connect to at such a deep level that I would feel that I could belong.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.320
So there's a visceral undeniable feeling of being alone.

15:28.320 --> 15:32.880
Yes. And I noticed the same thing when I came into the math school that

15:32.880 --> 15:37.920
I think at least half, probably two thirds of these kids were severely traumatized as

15:38.480 --> 15:41.600
children growing up and in large part due to being alone

15:42.400 --> 15:44.720
because they couldn't find anybody to relate to.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.280
Don't you think everybody's alone, deep down?

15:47.280 --> 15:47.520
No.

15:52.960 --> 15:53.440
All right.

15:53.440 --> 16:00.080
I'm not alone anymore. It took me some time to update and to get over the trauma and so on,

16:00.080 --> 16:05.760
but I felt that in my 20s, I had lots of friends and I had my place in the world.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.640
And I had no longer doubts that I would never be alone again.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.840
Is there some aspect to which we're alone together? You don't see a deep loneliness

16:15.840 --> 16:17.360
inside yourself still?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.360
No. Sorry.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.600
Okay. So that's the nonlinear progression through the stages, I suppose. You caught

16:25.600 --> 16:26.640
up on stage three at some point?

16:26.640 --> 16:30.080
Yes. We're at stage four. And so basically I find that many nerds

16:30.080 --> 16:33.440
jump straight into stage four by passing stage three.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.200
Do they return to it then later?

16:35.200 --> 16:40.320
Yeah, of course. Sometimes they do, not always. The question is basically, do you stay a little

16:40.320 --> 16:45.920
bit autistic or do you catch up? And I believe you can catch up. You can build this missing

16:45.920 --> 16:52.400
structure and basically experience yourself as part of a group, learn intuitive empathy,

16:52.400 --> 16:56.720
and develop this perceptual sense of feeling what other people feel.

16:57.440 --> 17:01.520
And before that, I could only basically feel this when I was deeply in love with somebody

17:01.520 --> 17:02.160
and we synced.

17:03.040 --> 17:08.880
So there's a lot of friction to feeling that way. It only with certain people as opposed

17:08.880 --> 17:10.960
to it comes naturally. It's frictionless.

17:10.960 --> 17:16.160
But this is something that basically later I felt started to resolve itself for me,

17:16.880 --> 17:17.600
to a large degree.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.240
What was the trick?

17:21.200 --> 17:28.560
In many ways, growing up and paying attention. Meditation did help. I had some very crucial

17:28.560 --> 17:38.400
experiences in getting close to people, building connections, cuddling a lot in my student years.

17:39.680 --> 17:47.040
So really paying attention to the feeling of another human being fully.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.920
Loving other people and being loved by other people and building a space in which you can be

17:51.920 --> 17:58.480
safe and can experiment and touch a lot and be close to somebody a lot.

17:58.480 --> 18:05.600
And over time, basically, at some point you realize, oh, it's no longer that I feel locked

18:05.600 --> 18:10.160
out, but I feel connected and I experience where somebody else is at.

18:10.160 --> 18:15.200
And normally my mind is racing very fast at a high frequency. So it's not always working

18:15.200 --> 18:18.560
like this. Sometimes it works better. Sometimes it works less.

18:18.560 --> 18:24.000
But I also don't see this as a pressure. It's more interesting to observe myself

18:24.000 --> 18:28.400
which frequency I'm at and at which mode somebody else is at.

18:29.760 --> 18:35.680
Yeah. Man, the mind is so beautiful in that way. Sometimes it comes so natural to me,

18:35.680 --> 18:40.720
so easy to pay attention to the world fully, to other people fully.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.880
And sometimes the stress over silly things is overwhelming.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.240
It's so interesting that the mind is that roller coaster in that way.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.760
At stage five, you discover how identity is constructed.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.520
Self-offered. You realize that your

18:53.520 --> 18:59.280
values are not terminal, but they are instrumental to achieving a world that you like and aesthetics

18:59.280 --> 19:04.800
that you prefer. And the more you understand this, the more you get agency over how your

19:04.800 --> 19:10.080
identity is constructed. And you realize that identity and interpersonal interaction is a

19:10.080 --> 19:16.080
costume. And you should be able to have agency over that costume. It's useful to be a costume.

19:16.080 --> 19:23.360
It tells something to others and allows to interface in roles. But being locked into this

19:23.360 --> 19:26.080
is a big limitation. The word costume kind of implies

19:26.800 --> 19:32.000
that it's fraudulent in some way. Is costume a good word for you?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.760
No. To present ourselves to the world.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.280
In some sense, I learned a lot about costumes at Burning Man. Before that,

19:37.280 --> 19:42.960
I did not really appreciate costumes and saw them more as uniforms, like wearing a suit if you are

19:42.960 --> 19:50.400
working in a bank or if you are trying to get startup funding from a VC in Switzerland.

19:51.600 --> 19:56.400
Then you dress up in a particular way. And this is mostly to show the other side that you are

19:56.400 --> 20:02.240
willing to play by the rules and you understand what the rules are. But there is something deeper.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.320
When you are at Burning Man, your costume becomes self-expression and there is no

20:06.320 --> 20:10.640
boundary to the self-expression. You're basically free to wear what you want,

20:10.640 --> 20:15.120
to express to other people what you feel like this day and what kind of interactions you want

20:15.120 --> 20:17.200
to have. Is the costume a kind of projection

20:18.560 --> 20:23.120
of who you are? That's very hard to say because the

20:23.120 --> 20:28.240
costume also depends on what other people see in the costume. And this depends on the context that

20:28.240 --> 20:33.120
the other people understand. So you have to create something, if you want to, that is legible

20:33.120 --> 20:39.600
to the other side and that means something to yourself. Do we become prisoners of the costume?

20:39.600 --> 20:44.320
Because everybody expects us to. Some people do. But I think that once you

20:44.320 --> 20:48.800
realize that you wear a costume at Burning Man, a variety of costumes,

20:48.800 --> 20:55.040
realize that you cannot not wear a costume. Basically everything that you wear and present

20:55.040 --> 21:03.120
to others is something that is to some degree in addition to what you are deep inside.

21:03.120 --> 21:10.480
So this stage, in parentheses, you put full adult, wisdom. Why is this full adult?

21:11.520 --> 21:15.280
Why would you say this is full? And why is it wisdom?

21:15.840 --> 21:21.120
It does allow you to understand why other people have different identities from yours.

21:21.840 --> 21:26.400
And it allows you to understand that the difference between people who vote for different

21:26.400 --> 21:32.560
parties and might have very different opinions and different value systems is often the accident of

21:32.560 --> 21:39.600
where they are born and what happened after that to them and what traits they got before they were

21:39.600 --> 21:46.080
born. And at some point you realize the perspective where you understand that everybody could be you

21:46.080 --> 21:51.040
in a different timeline if you just flip those bits. How many costumes do you have?

21:52.400 --> 21:56.240
I don't count. More than one? Yeah, of course.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.880
How easy is to do costume changes throughout the day?

22:00.880 --> 22:07.600
It's just a matter of energy and interest. When you are wearing your pajamas and you switch out

22:07.600 --> 22:15.200
of your pajamas into say a work shirt and pants, you're making a costume change, right? And if you

22:15.200 --> 22:19.040
are putting on a gown, you're making a costume change. And you could do the same with personality?

22:20.560 --> 22:25.840
You could if that's what you're into. There are people which have multiple personalities for

22:25.840 --> 22:32.640
interaction in multiple roles. If somebody works in a store and you put up a storekeeper personality

22:32.640 --> 22:37.040
when you're presenting yourself at work, you develop a sub-personality for this.

22:37.600 --> 22:43.600
And the social persona for many people is in some sense a puppet that they're playing like a marionette.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.120
And if they play this all the time, they might forget that there is something

22:47.680 --> 22:50.560
behind this. There's something what it feels like to be in your skin.

22:51.360 --> 22:58.000
And I guess it's very helpful if you're able to get back into this. And for me, the other way around

22:58.000 --> 23:03.120
is relatively hard. For me, it's pretty hard to learn how to play consistent social roles. For me,

23:03.120 --> 23:09.520
it's much easier just to be real. Or not real, but to have one costume.

23:10.640 --> 23:16.160
No, it's not quite the same. So basically when you are wearing a costume at Burning Man and say you

23:16.160 --> 23:22.560
are an extraterrestrial prince. There's something where you are expressing in some sense something

23:22.560 --> 23:28.640
that's closer to yourself than the way in which you hide yourself behind a standard closing when

23:28.640 --> 23:34.400
you go out in the city in the default world. And so this costume that you're wearing at Burning Man

23:34.400 --> 23:42.080
allows you to express more of yourself. And you have a shorter distance of advertising to people

23:43.040 --> 23:46.480
what kind of person you are, what kind of interaction you would want to have with them.

23:46.480 --> 23:55.280
And so you get much earlier into media stress. And I believe it's regrettable that we do not

23:55.280 --> 24:00.960
use the opportunities that we have with custom-made clothing now to wear costumes that are much more

24:01.840 --> 24:06.240
stylish, that are much more custom-made, that are not necessarily part of a fashion in which you

24:06.320 --> 24:11.520
express which milieu you're part of and how up-to-date you are. But you also express

24:12.400 --> 24:16.480
how you are as an individual and what you want to do today and how you feel today and

24:16.480 --> 24:21.520
what you intend to do about it. Well, isn't it easier now in the digital world to

24:23.600 --> 24:28.080
explore different costumes? I mean, that's the kind of idea with virtual reality. That's the

24:28.080 --> 24:33.600
idea even with Twitter and two-dimensional screens. You can swap all costumes. You can

24:33.600 --> 24:41.200
be as weird as you want. It's easier for Burning Man. You have to order things. You have to

24:41.200 --> 24:45.440
make things. It's even better if you make them yourself.

24:46.560 --> 24:50.720
Sure. But it's just easier to do digitally, right?

24:50.720 --> 24:55.360
It's not about easy. It's about how to get it right. And for me, the first Burning Man

24:55.360 --> 25:00.080
experience, I got adopted by a bunch of people in Boston who direct me to Burning Man. And

25:00.720 --> 25:06.480
we spent a few weekends doing costumes together. And it was an important part of the experience

25:06.480 --> 25:11.680
where the camp bonded, that people got to know each other. And we basically grew into the

25:11.680 --> 25:15.920
experience that we would have later. So the extraterrestrial prince is based

25:15.920 --> 25:17.040
on a true story. Yeah.

25:18.720 --> 25:24.160
I can only imagine what that looks like, Josje. Stage six.

25:24.160 --> 25:31.360
Stage six. At some point, you can collapse the division between a personal self and

25:31.360 --> 25:37.360
world generator again. And a lot of people get there via meditation, or some of them get there

25:37.360 --> 25:43.200
via psychedelics, some of them by accident. And you suddenly notice that you are not actually

25:43.200 --> 25:48.720
a person, but you are a vessel that can create a person. And the person is still there. You

25:48.720 --> 25:53.520
observe that personal self, but you observe the personal self from the outside. And you

25:53.520 --> 25:58.560
notice it's a representation. And you might also notice that the world that is being created is a

25:58.560 --> 26:03.040
representation. If not, then you might experience that I am the universe. I'm the thing that is

26:03.040 --> 26:08.560
creating everything. And of course, what you're creating is not quantum mechanics and the physical

26:08.560 --> 26:13.280
universe. What you're creating is the scheme engine that is updating the world. And you're

26:13.280 --> 26:20.320
creating your feelings and all the people inside of that world, including the person that you

26:20.320 --> 26:25.040
identify with yourself in this world. Are you creating the game engine or are you noticing the

26:25.040 --> 26:31.280
game engine? You noticed how you're generating the game engine. And I mean, when you are dreaming

26:31.280 --> 26:37.200
at night, you can, if you have a lucid dream, you can learn how to do this deliberately.

26:37.200 --> 26:43.200
And in principle, you can also do it during the day. And the reason why we don't get to do this

26:43.200 --> 26:47.680
from the beginning and why we don't have agency of our feelings right away is because we would

26:47.680 --> 26:54.480
game it before they have the necessary amount of wisdom to deal with creating this dream that we

26:54.480 --> 27:00.080
are in. You don't want to get access to cheat codes too quickly. Otherwise, you won't enjoy.

27:00.080 --> 27:06.080
So stage five is already pretty rare. And stage six is even more rare. You basically find this

27:06.080 --> 27:12.480
mostly with advanced Buddhist meditators and so on that are dropping into the stage and can

27:12.480 --> 27:17.440
induce it at will and spend time in it. So stage five requires a good therapist,

27:17.440 --> 27:22.800
stage six requires a good Buddhist spiritual leader.

27:23.760 --> 27:29.120
For instance, could be that is the right thing to do. But it's not that these stages give you

27:29.120 --> 27:35.360
scores or levels that you need to advance to. It's not that the next stage is better. You live your

27:35.360 --> 27:40.720
life and the more that works best at any given moment. And when your mind decides that you should

27:40.720 --> 27:45.680
have a different configuration, then it's building that configuration. And for many people, they

27:46.560 --> 27:51.200
stay happily at stage three and experience it themselves as part of groups. And there's

27:51.200 --> 27:55.040
nothing wrong with this. And for some people, this doesn't work and they're forced to

27:55.040 --> 28:00.720
build more agency over their rational beliefs than this and construct their norms rationally.

28:00.720 --> 28:06.480
And so they go to this level. And stage seven is something that is more or less hypothetical.

28:06.480 --> 28:11.200
That would be the stage in which it's basically a transhumanist stage in which you understand how

28:11.200 --> 28:17.840
you work and which the mind fully realizes how it's implemented and can also in principle enter

28:17.840 --> 28:23.040
different modes in which it could be implemented. And that's the stage that as far as I understand

28:23.040 --> 28:29.040
is not open to people yet. Oh, but it is possible through the process of technology.

28:29.040 --> 28:35.200
Yes. And who knows if there are biological agents that are working at different time skills than us

28:35.200 --> 28:38.720
that basically become aware of the way in which they're implemented on ecosystems

28:39.360 --> 28:44.960
and can change that implementation and have agency over how they're implemented in the world.

28:44.960 --> 28:49.680
And what I find interesting about the discussion about AI alignment, that it seems to be

28:50.240 --> 28:55.120
following these stages very much. Most people seem to be in stage three, also according to

28:55.120 --> 29:00.720
Robert Keegan. I think he says that about 85% of people are in stage three and stay there.

29:01.360 --> 29:07.200
And if you're in stage three and your opinions are the result of social assimilation,

29:07.760 --> 29:12.560
then what you're mostly worried about in the AI is that the AI might have the wrong opinions.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.920
So if the AI says something racist or sexist, we are all lost because we will assimilate the

29:17.920 --> 29:22.640
wrong opinions from the AI. And so we need to make sure that the AI has the right opinions and the

29:22.640 --> 29:28.240
right values and the right structure. And if you are at stage four, that's not your main concern.

29:28.240 --> 29:34.960
And so most nerds don't really worry about the algorithmic bias and the model that it picks up

29:34.960 --> 29:39.360
because if there's something wrong with this bias, the AI ultimately will prove it. At some point,

29:39.360 --> 29:44.720
we'll gather that it makes mathematical proofs about reality and then it will figure out what's

29:44.720 --> 29:49.520
true and what's false. But you're still worried that AI might turn you into paperclips because

29:49.520 --> 29:54.960
it might have the wrong values, right? So if it's set up as the wrong function that controls its

29:54.960 --> 29:59.920
direction in the world, then it might do something that is completely horrible and there's no easy

29:59.920 --> 30:04.640
way to fix it. So that's more like a stage four rationalist kind of worry. And if you are at stage

30:04.640 --> 30:09.280
five, you're mostly worried that the AI is not going to be enlightened fast enough because you

30:09.280 --> 30:13.360
realize that the game is not so much about intelligence, but about agency, about the

30:13.360 --> 30:21.120
ability to control the future. And the identity is instrumental to this. And if you are a human

30:21.120 --> 30:26.880
being, I think at some level you ought to choose your own identity. You should not have somebody

30:26.880 --> 30:32.080
else pick the costume for you and then wear it, but instead you should be mindful about what you

30:32.080 --> 30:37.760
want to be in this world. And I think if you are an agent that is fully malleable, that can

30:37.760 --> 30:43.600
rewrite its own source code, like an AI might do at some point, then the identity that you will have

30:43.600 --> 30:51.760
is whatever you can be. And in this way, the AI will maybe become everything, like a planetary

30:51.760 --> 30:59.040
control system. And if it does that, then if we want to coexist with it, it means that it will have

30:59.040 --> 31:03.760
to share purposes with us. So it cannot be a transactional relationship. We will not be able

31:03.760 --> 31:10.480
to use reinforcement learning with human feedback to hard wire its values into it. But this has to

31:10.480 --> 31:15.280
happen. It's probably that it's conscious, so it can relate to our own mode of existence where

31:15.280 --> 31:22.480
an observer is observing itself in real time and visit certain temporal frames. And the other

31:22.480 --> 31:26.560
thing is that it probably needs to have some kind of transcendental orientation, building shared

31:26.560 --> 31:32.720
agency in the same way as we do when we are able to enter up with each other into non-transactional

31:32.720 --> 31:39.280
relationships. And I find that something that, because the stage five is so rare, is missing

31:39.280 --> 31:46.960
in much of the discourse. And I think that we need, in some sense, focus on how to formalize love,

31:46.960 --> 31:52.240
how to understand love, and how to build it into the machines that we are currently building and

31:52.240 --> 31:57.520
that are about to become smarter than us. Well, I think this is a good opportunity to try to sneak

31:57.520 --> 32:04.320
up to the idea of enlightenment. So you wrote a series of good tweets about consciousness and

32:04.320 --> 32:09.760
panpsychism. So let's break it down. First, you say, I suspect the experience that leads to

32:09.760 --> 32:15.360
the panpsychism syndrome of some philosophers and other consciousness enthusiasts represents

32:15.360 --> 32:21.920
the realization that we don't end at the self, but share a resonant universe representation

32:21.920 --> 32:29.360
with every other observer coupled to the same universe. This actually eventually leads us to

32:29.360 --> 32:33.840
a lot of interesting questions about AI and AGI, but let's start with this representation.

32:33.840 --> 32:40.080
What is this resonant universe representation? And what do you think? Do we share such a

32:40.080 --> 32:45.600
representation? The neuroscientist Grossberg has come up with the cognitive architecture that he

32:45.600 --> 32:52.480
calls the adaptive resonance theory. And his perspective is that our neurons can be understood

32:52.480 --> 32:57.120
as oscillators that are resonating with each other and with outside phenomena.

32:57.840 --> 33:03.280
So the coarse-grained model of the universe that we are building, in some sense, is a resonance

33:03.280 --> 33:09.440
with objects and outside of us in the world. So basically, we take up patterns that of the

33:09.440 --> 33:15.840
universe that we are coupled with, and our brain is not so much understood as circuitry,

33:15.840 --> 33:21.600
even though this perspective is valid, but it's almost an ether in which the individual neurons

33:21.600 --> 33:27.680
are passing on chemo-electrical signals or arbitrary signals across all modalities that

33:27.680 --> 33:32.800
can be transmitted between cells, simulate each other in this way, and produce patterns

33:32.800 --> 33:38.480
that they modulate while passing them on. And this speed of signal progression in the brain

33:38.480 --> 33:44.480
is roughly at the speed of sound, incidentally, because the time that it takes for the signals to

33:44.480 --> 33:49.840
hop from cell to cell, which means it's relatively slow with respect to the world. It takes a

33:49.840 --> 33:54.240
appreciable fraction of a second for a signal to go through the entire neocortex, something like a

33:54.240 --> 33:59.040
few hundred milliseconds. And so there's a lot of stuff happening in that time where the signal is

33:59.040 --> 34:04.720
passing into your brain, including in the brain itself. So nothing in the brain is assuming that

34:04.720 --> 34:10.080
stuff happens simultaneously. Everything in the brain is working in a paradigm where the

34:10.080 --> 34:15.360
world has already moved on when you are ready to do the next thing to your signal,

34:15.360 --> 34:20.000
including the signal processing system itself. It's quite a different paradigm than the one in

34:20.000 --> 34:26.080
our digital computers, where we currently assume that your GPU or CPU is pretty much globally in

34:26.080 --> 34:33.200
the same state. So you mentioned there the non-dual state and say that some people confuse it for

34:33.200 --> 34:39.040
enlightenment. What's the non-dual state? There is a state in which you notice that you are

34:39.040 --> 34:45.360
no longer a person and instead you are one with the universe. So that speaks to the resonance.

34:45.360 --> 34:50.480
Yes. But this one with the universe is of course not accurately modeling that you are indeed

34:51.200 --> 34:55.920
some God entity or indeed the universe becoming aware of itself, even though you get this

34:55.920 --> 35:01.600
experience. I believe that you get this experience because your mind is modeling the fact that you

35:01.600 --> 35:07.200
are no longer identified with the personal self in that state, but you have transcended this

35:07.200 --> 35:12.240
division between the self model and the world model and you are experiencing yourself as your

35:12.240 --> 35:17.040
mind, as something that is representing a universe. But that's still part of the model.

35:17.040 --> 35:22.320
Yes. So it's inside of the model still. You're still inside of patterns that are generated in

35:22.320 --> 35:28.080
your brain and in your organism. And what you are now experiencing is that you're no longer

35:28.080 --> 35:33.680
this personal self in there, but you are the entirety of the mind and its contents.

35:33.680 --> 35:34.960
Why is it so hard to get there?

35:36.160 --> 35:40.400
A lot of people who get into the state think this or associate it with enlightenment. I

35:40.400 --> 35:47.200
suspect it's a favorite training goal for a number of meditators. But I think that

35:47.200 --> 35:52.960
enlightenment is in some sense more mundane and it's a step further or sideways. It's the state

35:52.960 --> 35:56.960
where you realize that everything is a representation. Yeah. You say enlightenment

35:56.960 --> 36:00.560
is a realization of how experience is implemented.

36:00.560 --> 36:05.600
Yes. Basically, you notice at some point that your qualia can be deconstructed.

36:06.240 --> 36:09.840
Reverse engineered? Almost like a schematic of it?

36:12.080 --> 36:16.720
You can start with looking at a face and maybe look at your own face in a mirror.

36:16.720 --> 36:22.400
Look at your face for a few hours in the mirror or for a few minutes. At some point,

36:22.400 --> 36:26.240
it will look very weird because you notice that there's actually no face.

36:26.240 --> 36:31.680
You basically start unseeing the face. What you see is a geometry. Then you can disassemble

36:31.680 --> 36:37.200
the geometry and realize how that geometry is being constructed in your mind. You can

36:37.200 --> 36:43.520
learn to modify this. Basically, you can change these generators in your own mind to shift the

36:43.520 --> 36:49.280
face around or to change the construction of the face, to change the way in which the features

36:49.280 --> 36:54.960
are being assembled. Why don't we do that more often? Why don't we start really messing with

36:54.960 --> 37:00.640
reality without the use of drugs or anything else? Why don't we get good at this kind of thing

37:03.760 --> 37:06.800
intentionally? Why should we? Why would you want to do that?

37:06.800 --> 37:14.400
Because you can morph reality into something more pleasant for yourself. Just have fun with it.

37:15.680 --> 37:20.320
That is probably what you shouldn't be doing because outside of your personal self,

37:20.320 --> 37:25.360
this outer mind is probably a relatively smart agent. What you often notice is that you have

37:25.360 --> 37:29.200
thoughts about how you should live, but you observe yourself doing different things and

37:29.200 --> 37:35.440
have different feelings. That's because your outer mind doesn't believe you and doesn't believe your

37:35.440 --> 37:38.960
rational thoughts. Can't you just silence the outer mind?

37:38.960 --> 37:41.680
The thing is that the outer mind is usually smarter than you are.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.240
Rational thinking is very brittle. It's very hard to use logic and symbolic thinking to have

37:48.240 --> 37:53.600
an accurate model of the world. There is often an underlying system that is looking at your

37:53.600 --> 37:58.240
rational thoughts and then tells you, no, you're still missing something. Your gut feeling is still

37:58.240 --> 38:04.880
saying something else. This can be, for instance, you find a partner that looks perfect or you find

38:04.880 --> 38:10.240
a deal and you build a company or whatever that looks perfect to you. Yet at some level,

38:10.240 --> 38:14.240
you feel something is off and you cannot put your finger on it. The more you reason about it,

38:14.240 --> 38:19.120
the better it looks to you. But the system that is outside still tells you, no, no,

38:19.120 --> 38:22.800
you're missing something. That system is powerful.

38:22.800 --> 38:29.760
People call this intuition. Intuition is this unreflected part of your attitude composition

38:29.760 --> 38:35.280
and computation where you produce a model of how you relate to the world and what you need to do

38:35.280 --> 38:40.880
it in it and what you can do in it and what's going to happen that is usually deeper and often

38:40.880 --> 38:45.120
more accurate than your reason. So if we look at this as you write in the tweet,

38:46.320 --> 38:51.120
if we look at this more rigorously as a sort of take the panpsychist idea more seriously,

38:51.120 --> 38:56.400
almost as a scientific discipline, you write that quote, fascinatingly, the panpsychist

38:56.400 --> 39:01.760
interpretation seems to lead to observations of practical results to a degree that physics

39:01.760 --> 39:08.800
fundamentalists might call superstitious. Reports of long distance telepathy and remote causation

39:08.800 --> 39:14.880
are ubiquitous in the general population. I am not convinced, says Yoshabak, that establishing

39:14.880 --> 39:20.320
the empirical reality of telepathy would force an update of any part of serious academic physics,

39:20.320 --> 39:26.080
but it could trigger an important revolution in both neuroscience and AI from a circuit perspective

39:26.080 --> 39:36.320
to a coupled complex resonator paradigm. Are you suggesting that there could be some rigorous

39:39.120 --> 39:42.560
mathematical wisdom to panpsychist perspective on the world?

39:43.280 --> 39:48.640
So first of all, panpsychism is the perspective that consciousness is inseparable from matter

39:48.640 --> 39:53.920
in the universe. And I find panpsychism quite unsatisfying because it does not explain

39:53.920 --> 39:58.800
consciousness. It does not explain how this aspect of matter produces. It's also when I

39:58.800 --> 40:04.320
try to formalize panpsychism and write down what it actually means with a more formal mathematical

40:04.320 --> 40:10.880
language, it's very difficult to distinguish it from saying that there is a software side to the

40:10.880 --> 40:15.040
world in the same way as there is a software side to what the transistors are doing in your computer.

40:15.040 --> 40:19.200
So basically, there is a pattern at a certain core screening of the universe that in some

40:19.200 --> 40:25.440
reasons of the universe leads to observers that are observing themselves. So panpsychism maybe is

40:25.440 --> 40:32.640
not even when I write it down a position that is distinct from functionalism. But intuitively,

40:32.640 --> 40:37.760
a lot of people feel that the activity of matter itself, of mechanisms in the world,

40:37.760 --> 40:43.120
is insufficient to explain it. So it's something that needs to be intrinsic to matter itself.

40:43.760 --> 40:51.200
And you can, apart from this abstract idea, have an experience in which you

40:52.240 --> 40:58.160
experience yourself as being the universe, which I suspect is basically happening because you

40:58.160 --> 41:03.920
manage to dissolve the division between personal self and mind that you establish as an infant when

41:03.920 --> 41:09.760
you construct the personal self and transcend it again and understand how it works. But there is

41:09.760 --> 41:15.280
something deeper that is that you feel that you're also sharing a state with other people, that you

41:16.960 --> 41:23.440
have an experience in which you notice that your personal self is moving into everything else,

41:23.440 --> 41:29.280
that you basically look out of the eyes of another person, that every agent in the world

41:29.280 --> 41:35.360
that is an observer is in some sense you. And we forget that we are the same agent.

41:35.920 --> 41:44.160
So is it that we feel that or do we actually accomplish it? So is telepathy possible? Is it

41:44.160 --> 41:51.440
real? For me, that's a question that I don't really know the answer to. In Turing's famous 1950 paper

41:51.440 --> 41:56.080
in which he describes the Turing test, he does speculate about telepathy, interestingly, and asks

41:56.080 --> 42:03.840
himself if telepathy is real and he thinks that it very well might be. What would be the implication

42:03.840 --> 42:08.960
for AI systems that try to be intelligent? Because he didn't see a mechanism by which a

42:08.960 --> 42:15.760
computer program would become telepathic. And I suspect if telepathy would exist or if all the

42:15.760 --> 42:21.840
reports that you get from people when you ask the normal person on the street, I find that very

42:21.840 --> 42:27.920
often they say, I have experiences with telepathy. The scientist might not be interested in this and

42:27.920 --> 42:33.600
might not have a theory about this, but I have difficulty explaining it away. And so you could

42:33.600 --> 42:38.560
say maybe this is a superstition, maybe it's a false memory, or maybe it's a little bit of psychosis.

42:38.560 --> 42:43.840
Who knows? Maybe somebody wants to make their own life more interesting or misremember something.

42:43.840 --> 42:49.280
But a lot of people report, I noticed something terrible happen to my partner and I know this is

42:49.280 --> 42:54.560
exactly the moment it happened where my child had an accident and I knew that was happening and the

42:54.560 --> 43:00.800
child was in a different town. So maybe it's a false memory where this is later on mistakenly

43:00.800 --> 43:05.600
attributed, but a lot of people think that this is not the correct explanation. So if something

43:05.600 --> 43:11.520
like this was real, what would it mean? It probably would mean that either your body is an antenna that

43:11.520 --> 43:19.360
is sending information over all sorts of channels, like maybe just electromagnetic radio signals that

43:19.360 --> 43:23.920
you're sending over long distances and you get attuned to another person that you spend enough

43:23.920 --> 43:30.720
time with to get a few bits out of the ether to figure out what this person is doing. Or maybe

43:30.720 --> 43:35.440
it's also when you are very close to somebody and you become empathetic with them. What happens is

43:35.520 --> 43:40.880
that you go into a resonance state with them, right? Similar to when people go into a seance

43:40.880 --> 43:45.760
and they go into a trance state and they start shifting a video board around on the table.

43:45.760 --> 43:52.160
I think what happens is that their minds go by their nervous systems into a resonance state

43:52.160 --> 43:56.000
in which they basically create something like a shared dream between them.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.040
Physical closeness or closeness broadly defined?

43:59.600 --> 44:04.560
With physical closeness it's much easier to experience empathy with someone, right? I suspect

44:04.560 --> 44:09.600
it would be difficult for me to have empathy for you if you were in a different town. Also,

44:11.200 --> 44:16.320
how would that work? But if you are very close to someone, you'd pick up all sorts of signals

44:16.320 --> 44:23.200
from their body, not just via your eyes, but with your entire body. And if the nervous system sits

44:23.200 --> 44:26.560
on the other side and the intercellular communication sits on the other side and is

44:26.560 --> 44:31.280
integrating over all these signals, you can make inferences about the state of the other. And it's

44:31.280 --> 44:35.520
not just the personal self that does this via reasoning, but your perceptual system.

44:35.520 --> 44:39.840
And what basically happens is that your representations are directly interacting.

44:39.840 --> 44:46.800
It's the physical resonant models of the universe that exist in your nervous system and in your body

44:46.800 --> 44:51.760
might go into resonance with others and start sharing some of their states. So you basically

44:53.360 --> 44:59.760
be next to somebody, you pick up some of their vibes and feel without looking at them what they're

44:59.760 --> 45:05.600
feeling in this moment. And it's difficult for you if you're very empathetic to detach yourself

45:05.600 --> 45:10.240
from it and have an emotional state that is completely independent from your environment.

45:10.240 --> 45:15.920
People who are highly empathetic are describing this. And now imagine that a lot of organisms

45:16.640 --> 45:21.200
on this planet have representations of the environment and operate like this,

45:21.200 --> 45:25.120
and they are adjacent to each other and overlapping. So there's going to be some

45:25.120 --> 45:28.800
degree in which there is basically some change in direction, and we are

45:29.760 --> 45:36.640
forming some slightly shared representation. And I know relatively few neuroscientists who

45:36.640 --> 45:43.600
consider this possibility. I think a big rarity in this regard is Michael Levin,

45:43.600 --> 45:50.560
who is considering these things in earnest. And I stumbled on this train of thought mostly by

45:50.560 --> 45:56.720
noticing that the tasks of a neuron can be fulfilled by other cells as well. They can

45:56.720 --> 46:01.600
send different type chemical messages and physical messages to their adjacent cells

46:01.600 --> 46:06.560
and learn when to do this and when not, make this conditional, and become universal function

46:06.560 --> 46:12.160
approximators. The only thing that they cannot do is telegraph information over axons very quickly

46:12.160 --> 46:18.960
over long distances. So neurons in this perspective are specially adapted kind of telegraph cell

46:18.960 --> 46:26.960
that has evolved so we can move our muscles very fast. But our body is in principle able to also

46:26.960 --> 46:34.000
make models of the world just much, much slower. It's interesting though that at this time,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.440
at least in human history, there seems to be a gap between the tools of science

46:38.640 --> 46:43.840
and the subjective experience that people report, like you're talking about with telepathy. And

46:44.800 --> 46:50.960
it seems like we're not quite there. No, I think that there is no gap between the

46:50.960 --> 46:55.040
tools of science and telepathy. Either it's there or it's not, and it's an empirical question. And

46:55.040 --> 47:00.240
if it's there, we should be able to detect it in a lab. So why is there not a lot of Michael Levin's

47:00.240 --> 47:06.800
walking around? I don't think that Michael Levin is specifically focused on telepathy very much.

47:06.800 --> 47:13.440
He is focused on self-organization in living organisms and in brains, both as a paradigm for

47:13.600 --> 47:18.080
development and as a paradigm for information processing. And when you think about how

47:18.080 --> 47:23.120
organization processing works in an organism, there is first of all radical locality, which

47:23.120 --> 47:27.760
means everything is decided locally from the perspective of an individual cell. The individual

47:27.760 --> 47:33.680
cell is the agent. And the other one is coherence. Basically, there needs to be some criterion

47:33.680 --> 47:39.840
that determines how these cells are interacting in such a way that order emerges on the next level

47:39.840 --> 47:48.480
of structure. And this principle of coherence of imposing constraints that are not validated

47:48.480 --> 47:54.560
by the individual parts and lead to coherent structure to basically transcendental agency

47:54.560 --> 48:00.320
where you form an agent on the next level of organization is crucial in this perspective.

48:00.320 --> 48:08.080
It's so cool that radical locality leads to the emergence of complexity at the higher layers.

48:08.720 --> 48:14.640
And I think what Michael Levin is looking at is nothing that is outside of the realm of science

48:14.640 --> 48:21.840
in any way. It's just that he is a paradigmatic thinker who develops his own paradigm. And most

48:21.840 --> 48:27.120
of the neuroscientists are using a different paradigm at this point. And this often happens

48:27.120 --> 48:33.040
in science that a field has a few paradigms in which people try to understand reality and

48:33.040 --> 48:37.440
build concepts and make experiments. You're kind of one of those type of

48:37.440 --> 48:41.360
paradigmatic thinkers. Actually, if we can take a tangent on that,

48:42.400 --> 48:47.280
once again, returning to the biblical verses of your tweets, you're right,

48:47.280 --> 48:54.000
my public explorations are not driven by audience service, but by my lack of ability for discovering,

48:54.000 --> 48:59.040
understanding or following the relevant authorities. So I have to develop my own

48:59.120 --> 49:04.640
thoughts. Since I think autonomously, these thoughts cannot always be very good.

49:05.280 --> 49:09.520
That's you apologizing for the chaos of your thoughts, or perhaps not apologizing,

49:09.520 --> 49:14.000
just identifying. But let me ask the question. Since we talked about

49:15.200 --> 49:23.040
Michael Levin and yourself, who I think are very kind of radical, big, independent thinkers,

49:24.320 --> 49:27.360
can we reverse engineer your process of thinking autonomously?

49:28.320 --> 49:30.720
How do you do it? How can humans do it?

49:32.320 --> 49:38.560
How can you avoid being influenced by, what is it, stage three?

49:40.320 --> 49:45.280
Well, why would you want to do that? You see what is working for you. And if it's

49:46.000 --> 49:49.280
not working for you, you build another structure that works better for you, right?

49:49.840 --> 49:56.720
And so I found myself when I was thrown into this world in a state where my intuitions

49:56.720 --> 50:02.240
were not working for me. I was not able to understand how I would be able to survive

50:02.240 --> 50:06.080
in this world and build the things that I was interested in, build the kinds of relationship

50:06.080 --> 50:12.480
I needed to work on the topics that I wanted to make progress on. And so I had to learn.

50:13.760 --> 50:19.440
For me, Twitter is not some tool of publication. It's not something where I put stuff that I

50:19.440 --> 50:24.000
entirely believe to be true and provable. It's an interactive notebook in which I explore

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
possibilities. And I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how consciousness

50:30.000 --> 50:36.000
works, I was quite optimistic. I thought there needs to be a big body of knowledge that I can

50:36.000 --> 50:42.560
just study and that works. And so I entered studies in philosophy and computer science,

50:43.120 --> 50:51.120
and later psychology and a bit of neuroscience and so on. And I was disappointed by what I found

50:51.120 --> 50:56.960
because I found that the questions of how consciousness works, how emotion works,

50:56.960 --> 51:02.400
how it's possible that the system can experience anything, how motivation emerges in the mind

51:02.400 --> 51:09.600
were not being answered by the authorities that I met and the schools that were around.

51:10.480 --> 51:16.000
And instead, I found that it was individual thinkers that had useful ideas that sometimes

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
were good, sometimes were not so good, sometimes were adopted by a large group of people,

51:20.000 --> 51:25.600
sometimes were rejected by large groups of people. But for me, it was much more interesting to see

51:25.600 --> 51:30.400
these minds as individuals. And in my perspective, thinking is still something that is done not in

51:30.400 --> 51:35.360
groups, that has to be done by individuals. So that motivated you to become an individual

51:35.360 --> 51:41.040
thinker yourself. I didn't have a choice. I didn't find a group that thought in a way where I felt,

51:41.040 --> 51:46.480
okay, I can just adopt everything that everybody thinks here and now I understand how consciousness

51:46.480 --> 51:53.040
works or how the mind works or how thinking works or what thinking even is or what feelings are and

51:53.040 --> 51:59.040
how they're implemented and so on. So to figure all this out, I had to take a lot of ideas from

51:59.040 --> 52:04.400
individuals and then try to put them together in something that works for myself. And on one

52:04.400 --> 52:10.720
hand, I think it helps if you try to go down and find first principles on which you can recreate

52:10.720 --> 52:16.080
how thinking works, how languages work, what representation is, whether representation is

52:16.080 --> 52:21.840
necessary, how the relationship between a representing agent and the world works in general.

52:22.560 --> 52:28.320
But how do you escape the influence? Once again, the pressure of the crowd, whether it's

52:29.920 --> 52:36.640
you in responding to the pressure or you being swept up by the pressure. If you even just look

52:36.640 --> 52:40.880
at Twitter, the opinions of the crowd. I don't feel pressure from the crowd. I'm completely

52:40.880 --> 52:47.200
immune to that. In the same sense, I don't have respect for authority. I have respect for what

52:47.200 --> 52:54.160
an individual is accomplishing or have respect for mental firepower. But it's not that I meet

52:54.160 --> 53:01.920
somebody and get dragged and unable to speak or then a large group of people has a certain idea

53:01.920 --> 53:07.200
that is different from mine. I don't necessarily feel intimidated, which has often been a problem

53:07.200 --> 53:12.880
for me in my life because I like instincts that other people develop at a very young age and that

53:13.600 --> 53:18.640
help with their self-preservation in a social environment. So I had to learn a lot of things

53:18.640 --> 53:27.280
the hard way. Yeah. So is there a practical advice you can give on how to think paradigmatically,

53:27.280 --> 53:33.840
how to think independently? Because you've kind of said, I had no choice. But I think

53:34.720 --> 53:36.240
to a degree, you have a choice

53:38.800 --> 53:43.200
because you said you want to be productive. And I think thinking independently is productive

53:43.200 --> 53:45.520
if what you're curious about is understanding the world,

53:47.440 --> 53:50.800
especially when the problems are very kind of new and open.

53:54.320 --> 54:02.240
It seems like this is an active process. We can choose to do that. We can practice it.

54:03.040 --> 54:08.640
Well, it's a very basic question. When you read a theory that you find convincing or interesting,

54:08.640 --> 54:14.800
how do you know? It's very interesting to figure out what are the sources of that other person,

54:14.800 --> 54:20.480
not which authority can they refer to that is then taking off the burden of being truthful. But

54:20.480 --> 54:25.600
how did this authority in turn know what is the epistemic chain to observables? What are the

54:25.600 --> 54:31.600
first principles from which the whole thing is derived? And when I was young, I was not blessed

54:31.600 --> 54:37.200
with a lot of people around myself who knew how to make proofs from first principles.

54:37.200 --> 54:42.240
And I think mathematicians do this quite naturally. But most of the great mathematicians

54:42.240 --> 54:48.320
do not become mathematicians in school, but they tend to be self-taught because school teachers

54:48.320 --> 54:53.200
tend not to be mathematicians. They tend not to be people who derive things from first principles.

54:53.200 --> 54:59.760
So when you ask your school teacher, does 2 plus 2 equal 4? Does your school teacher give

54:59.760 --> 55:04.720
you the right answer? It's a simple game. And there are many simple games that you could play.

55:04.720 --> 55:10.640
And most of those games that you could just take different rules would not lead to an interesting

55:10.640 --> 55:15.520
arithmetic. And so it's just an exploration, but you can try what happens if you take different

55:15.520 --> 55:21.760
axioms. And here is how you build axioms and derive addition from them. And a built addition

55:21.760 --> 55:29.280
is some basically syntactic sugar in it. And so I wish that somebody would have opened me

55:29.280 --> 55:35.520
this vista and explained to me how I can build a language in my own mind from which I can derive

55:35.520 --> 55:43.440
what I'm seeing and which I can make geometry and counting and all the number games that we are

55:43.440 --> 55:48.960
playing in our life. And on the other hand, I felt that I learned a lot of this while I was

55:48.960 --> 55:54.720
programming as a child. When you start out with a computer like a Commodore 64, which doesn't have

55:54.720 --> 55:59.920
a lot of functionality, it's relatively easy to see how a bunch of relatively simple circuits

56:00.880 --> 56:08.000
are just basically performing hashes between bit patterns and how you can build the entirety

56:08.000 --> 56:13.040
of mathematics and computation on top of this and all the representational languages that you need.

56:13.760 --> 56:19.120
Man, Commodore 64 could be one of the sexiest machines ever built, if I say so myself.

56:19.760 --> 56:27.440
If we can return to this really interesting idea that we started to talk about with panpsychism

56:30.720 --> 56:38.160
and the complex resonator paradigm and the verses of your tweets. You write,

56:38.160 --> 56:42.800
instead of treating eyes, ears, and skin as separate sensory systems with fundamentally

56:42.800 --> 56:47.920
different modalities, we might understand them as overlapping aspects of the same universe,

56:47.920 --> 56:53.280
coupled at the same temporal resolution and almost inseparable from a single share resonant

56:53.280 --> 56:58.960
model. Instead of treating mental representations as fully isolated between minds, the representations

56:58.960 --> 57:05.440
of physically adjacent observers might directly interact and produce causal effects through the

57:05.440 --> 57:12.320
coordination of the perception and behavior of world modeling observers. The modalities,

57:12.320 --> 57:17.280
the distinction between modalities, let's throw that away. The distinction between the individuals,

57:17.280 --> 57:22.640
let's throw that away. So what does this interaction representations look like?

57:25.920 --> 57:30.160
When you think about how you represent the interaction of us in this room,

57:30.160 --> 57:34.960
at some level, the modalities are quite distinct. They're not completely distinct,

57:34.960 --> 57:39.200
but you can see this as vision. You can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.560
But you still imagine how my mouth is moving when you hear something and you know that it's

57:45.360 --> 57:51.520
very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes and you get back into the shared merge

57:51.520 --> 57:57.840
space. And we also have these experiments where we noticed that the way in which my lips are moving

57:57.840 --> 58:02.960
are affecting how you hear the sound. And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing have

58:02.960 --> 58:10.080
an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features. And so these modalities are

58:10.080 --> 58:14.640
not separate in your mind. They are merged at some fundamental level where you are

58:15.360 --> 58:20.480
interpreting the entire scene that you are in. And your own interactions in the scene are also

58:20.480 --> 58:24.880
not completely separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene. But there is

58:24.880 --> 58:30.800
some resonance that is going on where we also have a degree of shared mental representations

58:30.800 --> 58:35.840
and shared empathy due to being in the same space and having vibes between each other.

58:35.920 --> 58:44.080
Vibes. So the question, though, is how deeply inter-bind is this multi-modality, multi-agent

58:44.080 --> 58:53.200
system? I mean, this is going to the telepathy question without the woo-woo meaning of the word

58:53.200 --> 58:58.160
telepathy. It's like, what's going on here in this room right now?

58:59.120 --> 59:07.760
So if telepathy would work, how could it work? Imagine that all the cells in your body are

59:07.760 --> 59:12.800
sending signals in a similar way as neurons are doing, just by touching the other cells and sending

59:12.800 --> 59:17.360
chemicals to them, the other cells interpreting them, learning how to react to them. And they

59:17.360 --> 59:22.480
learn how to approximate functions in this way and compute behavior for the organisms. And this

59:22.480 --> 59:27.440
is something that is open to plants as well. And so plants probably have software running on them

59:27.440 --> 59:32.640
that is controlling how the plant is working in a similar way as you have a mind that is controlling

59:32.640 --> 59:39.680
how you are behaving in the world. And this spirit of plants is something that

59:39.680 --> 59:46.000
has been very well described by our ancestors, and they found this quite normal. But for some

59:46.000 --> 59:50.240
reason, since the Enlightenment, we are treating this notion that there are spirits in nature

59:50.240 --> 59:56.480
and that plants have spirits as a superstition. And I think we probably have to rediscover that,

59:56.480 --> 01:00:02.720
that plants have software running on them. And we already did. You notice that there is a control

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.760
system in the plant that connects every part of the plant to every other part of the plant and

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.480
produces coherent behavior in the plant. That is, of course, much, much slower than the coherent

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:19.040
behavior in an animal like us that has a nervous system where everything is synchronized much,

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:24.720
much faster by the neurons. But what you also notice is that if a plant is sitting next to

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.880
another plant, like you have a very old tree and this tree is building some kind of information

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.400
highway along its cells so it can send information from its leaves to its roots and from some part

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.480
of the root to another part of the roots, and there is a fungus living next to the tree,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.200
the fungus can probably piggyback on the communication between the cells of the tree

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.600
and send its own signals through the tree. And vice versa, the tree might be able to send

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.240
information to the fungus. Because after all, how would they build a viable firewall if that

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.800
other organism is sitting next to them all the time and is never moving away? And so they will

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:02.720
have to get along. And over a long enough timeframe, the networks of roots in the forest

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:09.040
and all the other plants that are there and the fungi that are there might be forming something

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.440
like a biological internet. But the question there is, do they have to be touching? Is biology at a

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.360
distance possible? Of course, you can use any kind of physical signal. You can use sounds,

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.720
you can use electromagnetic waves that are integrated over many cells. It's conceivable

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:34.880
that across distances, there are many kinds of information pathways. But also, our planetary

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.080
surface is pretty full of organisms, full of cells. So everything is touching everything else.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.880
And it's been doing this for many millions and even billions of years. So there was enough time

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.280
for information processing networks to form. And if you think about how a mind is self-organizing,

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.000
basically it needs to, in some sense, reward the cells for computing the mind, for building

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.680
the necessary dynamics between the cells that allow the mind to stabilize itself

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.920
and remain on there. But if you look at these spirits of plants that are growing very close

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.640
to each other in the forest and might be almost growing into each other, these spirits might be

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.400
able even to move to some degree, not to become somewhat dislocated and shift around in that

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:28.000
ecosystem. So if you think about what a mind is, it's a bunch of activation waves that form

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.040
coherent patterns and process information in a way that are colonizing an environment well enough to

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.760
allow the continuous sustenance of the mind, the continuous stability and self-stabilization of the

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:49.680
mind, then it's conceivable that we can link into this biological internet, not necessarily at the

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.640
speed of our nervous system, but maybe at the speed of our body and make some kind of subconscious

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.080
connection to the world where we use our body as an antenna into biological information processing.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.080
Now, these ideas are completely speculative. I don't know if any of that is true.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.360
But if that was true, and if you want to explain telepathy, I think it's much more likely that

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.920
that telepathy could be explained using such mechanisms rather than

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.080
undiscovered quantum processes that would break the standard model of physics.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.800
Could there be undiscovered processes that don't break?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:31.200
Yeah. So if you think about something like an internet in the forest, that is something that

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:35.600
is borderline discovered. There are basically a lot of scientists who point out that they do

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.440
observe that plants are communicating the forest's root networks and send information,

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.560
for instance, warn each other about new pests entering the forest and things that are happening

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.600
like this. So basically, there is communication between plants and fungi that has been observed.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.080
It's been observed, but we haven't plugged into it. So it's like if you observe humans,

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.920
they seem to be communicating with a smartphone thing, but you don't understand how smartphone

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.320
works and how the mechanism of the internet works. But maybe it's possible to really understand

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.240
the full richness of the biological internet that connects us.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.880
An interesting question is whether the communication and the organization principles

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.360
of biological information processing are as complicated as the technology that we've built.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:28.080
They set up on very different principles, right? They simultaneously look very differently in

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.920
biological systems, and the entire thing needs to be stochastic instead of being

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.760
fully deterministic or almost fully deterministic as our digital computers are. So there is a

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:46.400
different base protocol layer that would emerge over the biological structure

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.200
if such a thing would be happening. And again, I'm not saying here that telepathy works and

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:59.440
not saying that this is not true, but what I'm saying is I think I'm open to a possibility that

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.800
we see that a few bits can be traveling long distance between organisms using biological

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.880
information processing in ways that we are not completely aware of right now and that are more

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.720
similar to many of the stories that were completely normal for our ancestors.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:23.840
Well, this kind of interacting, intertwined representations takes us to the big

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:32.080
ending of your tweet series. You write, quote, I wonder if self-improving AGI might end up

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.480
saturating physical environments with intelligence to such a degree that isolation of individual

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.360
mental states becomes almost impossible. And the representations of all complex

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:51.280
self-organizing agents merge permanently with each other. So that's a really interesting idea.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:59.840
This biological network, life network gets so dense that it might as well be seen as one.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.120
That's an interesting, what do you think that looks like? What do you think that

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:09.360
saturation looks like? What does it feel like? I think it's a possibility. It's just a vague

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:17.520
possibility. And I like to explain, but what this looks like, I think that the end game of

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:24.240
AGI is substrate agnostic. That means that AGI ultimately, if it is being built, is going to be

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:30.160
smart enough to understand how AGI works. This means it's not going to be better than people

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.360
at AGI research and can take over in building the next generation, but it fully understands how it

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.000
works and how it's being implemented. And also, of course, understands how computation works in

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.720
nature, how to build new feedback loops that you can turn into your own circuits. And this means

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:49.840
that the AGI is likely to virtualize itself into any environment that can compute. So it's

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.960
breaking free from the silicon substrate and is going to move into the ecosystems, into our bodies,

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:01.680
our brains, and is going to merge with all the agency that it finds there. So it's conceivable

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:07.520
that you end up with completely integrated information processing across all computing

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:13.120
systems, including biological computation on earth. That we end up triggering some new step

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:19.200
in the evolution where basically some Gaia is being built over the entirety of all digital

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:27.200
and biological computation. And if this happens, then basically everywhere around us, you will have

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.800
agents that are connected and that are representing and building models of the world. And their

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.400
representations will physically interact. They will vibe with each other. And if you find yourself

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:46.800
into an environment that is saturated with modeling compute, where basically almost every

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:54.160
grain of sand could be part of computation that is at some point being started by the AI,

01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:00.000
you could find yourself in a situation where you cannot escape this shared representation anymore

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.200
and where you indeed notice that everything in the world has one shared resonant model of everything

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.960
that's happening on the planet. And you notice which part you are in this thing. And you become

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:17.360
part of a very larger, almost holographic mind in which all the parts are observing each other

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:23.760
and form a coherent whole. So you lose the ability to notice yourself as a distinct

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.800
entity. No, I think that when you are conscious in your own mind, you notice yourself as a

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.960
distinct entity. You notice yourself as a self-reflexive observer. And I suspect that

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.760
we become conscious at the beginning of our mental development, not at some very high level.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.640
Consciousness seems to be part of a training mechanism that biological nervous systems have

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.000
to discover to become trainable because you cannot take a nervous system like ours and

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.960
do a stochastic wave to send us back propagation over 100 layers. This would not be stable on

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:03.200
biological neurons. And so instead, we start with some colonizing principle in which a part of the

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:09.120
mental representations form a notion of being a self-reflexive observer that is imposing coherence

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.720
on its environment. And this spreads until the boundary of your mind. And if that boundary is

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.680
no longer clear cut because AI is jumping across substrates, it would be interesting to see what

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.080
a global mind would look like that is basically producing a globally coherent language of thought

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.880
and is representing everything from all the possible vantage points.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.040
CB That's an interesting world.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.640
MG The intuition that this thing grew out of is a particular mental state. And it's a state that

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.560
you find sometimes in literature. For instance, Neil Gaiman describes it in the ocean at the end

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:54.400
of the lane. And it's this idea or this experience that there is a state in which you feel that you

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.280
know everything that can be known and that in your normal human mind, you've only forgotten.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.280
You've forgotten that you are the entire universe. And some people describe this

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.360
after they've taken an extremely large amount of mushrooms or had a big spiritual experience

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:16.480
as hippie in their 20s. And they notice basically that they are in everything. And their body is

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:22.480
only one part of the universe and nothing ends at their body. And actually everything is observing

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.960
and they are part of this big observer. And the big observer is focused as one local point in their

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.960
body and their personality and so on. But we can basically have this oceanic state in which we have

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.640
no boundaries and are one with everything. And a lot of meditators call this the non-dual state

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.760
because you no longer have the separation between self and world. And as I said, you can explain the

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:52.240
state relatively simply without panpsychism or anything else, but just by breaking down the

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.040
constructed boundary between self and world and our own mind. But if you combine this with the

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.840
notion that the systems are physically interacting to the point where their representations are

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.320
merging and interacting with each other, you would literally implement something like this.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.040
It would still be a representational state. You would not be one with physics itself.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.320
It would still be coarse-grained. It would still be much slower than physics itself.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.920
But it would be a representation in which you become aware that you're part of some kind of

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.800
global information processing system, like a thought and a global mind and a conscious thought

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.160
that coexisting with many other self-reflexive thoughts.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.360
I would love to observe that from a video game design perspective, how that game looks.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.600
Maybe you will after we build AGI and it takes over.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.680
But would you be able to step away, step out of the whole thing, just kind of watch

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.360
the way we can now? Sometimes when I'm at a crowded party or something like this,

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.720
you step back and you realize all the different costumes, all the different interactions,

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.640
all the different computation, that all the individual people are once distinct from each

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.280
other and at once all the same. It's already what we do. We can have thoughts that are integrative

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.920
and we have kind of thoughts that are highly dissociated from everything else

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.280
and experience themselves as separate. But you want to allow yourself to have those thoughts.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.280
Sometimes you kind of resist it. I think that it's not normative.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.800
It's more descriptive. I want to understand the space of states that we can be in and that people

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.120
are reporting and make sense of them. It's not that I believe that it's your job in life to get

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:42.400
to a particular kind of state and then you get a high score. Or maybe you do. I think you're really

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.720
against this high-scoring thing. I kind of like it. You're probably very competitive and I'm not.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.320
No, not competitive. Like role-playing games like Skyrim, it's not competitive. There's a

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.040
nice thing, there's a nice feeling where your experience points go up. You're not competing

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:02.240
against anybody, but it's the world saying, you're on the right track. Here's a point.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.520
That's the game saying it. It's the game economy. And I found when I was playing games and was

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:13.040
getting addicted to these systems, then I would get into the game and hack it. So I get control

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.240
over the scoring system and would no longer be subject to it. So you're no longer playing,

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.600
you're trying to hack it. I don't want to be addicted to anything. I want to be in charge.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.800
I want to have agency over what I do. Addiction is the loss of control for you? Yes. Addiction

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:34.400
means that you're doing something compulsively. And the opposite of free will is not determinism,

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:40.640
it's compulsion. You don't want to lose yourself in the addiction to something nice?

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.480
Addiction to love, to the pleasant feelings we humans experience?

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:53.920
No, I find this gets old. I don't want to have the best possible emotions. I want to have the

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.560
most appropriate emotions. I don't want to have the best possible experience. I want to have

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.920
an adequate experience that is serving my goals, the stuff that I find meaningful in this world.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:11.920
From the biggest questions of consciousness, let's explore the pragmatic, the projections

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:19.760
of those big ideas into our current world. What do you think about LLMs, the recent rapid development

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:29.120
of large language models, of the AI world, of generative AI? How much of the hype is deserved

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.960
and how much is not? And people should definitely follow your Twitter because you explore these

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.880
questions in a beautiful, profound and hilarious way at times. No, don't follow my Twitter. I

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.000
already have too many followers. At some point it's going to be unpleasant. I noticed that a lot of

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:56.640
people feel that it's totally okay to punch up. And it's a very weird notion that you feel that

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.680
you haven't changed, but your account has grown and suddenly you have a lot of people who casually

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:08.240
abuse you. And I don't like that I have to block more than before. And I don't like this overall

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:14.880
vibe shift. And right now it's still somewhat okay, so pretty much okay. So I can go to a place

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.560
where people work on stuff that I'm interested in and there's a good chance that a few people

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:26.320
in the room know me, so there's no awkwardness. But when I get to a point where random strangers

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.400
feel that they have to have an opinion about me one way or the other, I don't think I would like

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:38.080
that. And random strangers because of your kind of in their mind elevated position. Yes. So basically

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:45.520
whenever you are in any way prominent or some kind of celebrity, random strangers will have to have

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.120
an opinion about you. Yeah. And they kind of forget that you're human too. I mean, you notice

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.800
this thing yourself that the more popular you get, the higher the pressure becomes, the more

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:03.280
winds are blowing in your direction from all sides. And it's stressful, right? And it does

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.840
have a little bit of upside, but it also has a lot of downside. I think it has a lot of upside,

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.640
at least for me currently, at least perhaps because of the podcast. Because most people

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.080
are really good and people come up to me and they have love in their eyes and over a stretch of like

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:26.640
30 seconds, you can hug it out and you can just exchange a few words and you reinvigorate your

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:35.360
love for humanity. So that's an upside for a loner. Because otherwise you have to do a lot of work to

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:43.120
find such humans. And here you're like thrust into the full humanity, the goodness of humanity

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:50.640
for the most part. Of course, maybe it gets worse as you become more prominent. I hope not.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.120
This is pretty awesome. I have a couple handful very close friends and I don't have enough time

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.080
for them and attention for them as it is. And I find this very, very regrettable. And then there

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.440
are so many awesome, interesting people that I keep meeting and I would like to integrate them

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:13.440
in my life, but I just don't know how because there's only so much time and attention. And

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.040
the older I get, the harder it is to bond with new people in the deep way.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.920
But can you enjoy, I mean, there's a picture of you, I think, with Roger Penrose and Eric

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:28.720
Weinstein and a few others that are interesting figures. Can't you just enjoy random, interesting

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:35.040
humans for a short amount of time? I like these people and what I like is intellectual

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.840
stimulation and I'm very grateful that I'm getting it. Can you not be melancholy or maybe

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:45.920
I'm projecting, I hate goodbyes. Can we just not hate goodbyes and just enjoy the hello,

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.800
take it in, take in a person, take in their ideas and then move on through life?

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.000
I think it's totally okay to be sad about goodbyes because that indicates that there

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.360
was something that you're going to miss. Yeah, but it's painful.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.720
Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm an introvert is I hate goodbyes.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.960
But you have to say goodbye before you say hello again.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.920
I know, but that experience of loss, that mini loss,

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.680
maybe that's a little death. Maybe, I don't know. I think this melancholy feeling is just the other

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.520
side of love and I think they go hand in hand and it's a beautiful thing.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.800
I'm just being romantic about it at the moment. I'm not no stranger to melancholy and sometimes

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.320
it's difficult to be here to be alive. Sometimes it's just painful to exist.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.240
But there's beauty in that pain too. That's what melancholy feeling is. It's not negative.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.200
Melancholy doesn't have to be negative. It can also kill you.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:05.120
Well, we all die eventually. Now, as we got to this topic, the actual question

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:10.320
was about what your thoughts are about the recent development of large language models with chat

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:17.600
GPT. There's a lot of hype. Is some of the hype justified? Which is, which isn't? What are your

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.520
thoughts? High level. I find that large language models too

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.160
have this coding. It's an extremely useful application that is for a lot of people

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.560
taking stack overflow out of their life and it can change for something that is more efficient.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:41.440
I feel that chat GPT is like an intern that I have to micromanage. I have been working

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:49.040
with people in the past who were less capable than chat GPT. I'm not saying this because I hate

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.040
people. They personally as human beings, there was something present that was not there in chat

01:19:53.040 --> 01:20:02.240
GPT, which was why I was covering for them. But chat GPT has an interesting ability. It does give

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:07.600
people superpowers and the people who feel threatened by them are the prompt completers.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.600
They are the people who do what chat GPT is doing right now. So if you are not creative,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.200
if you don't build your own thoughts, if you don't have actual plans in the world and

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:24.080
your only job is to summarize emails and to expand simple intentions into emails again,

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:31.520
then chat GPT might look like a threat. But I believe that it is a very beneficial technology

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:37.680
that allows us to create more interesting stuff and make the world more beautiful and fascinating

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:44.640
if we find to build it into our life in the right ways. So I'm quite fascinated by these large

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.920
language models, but I also think that they are by no means the final development.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.960
And it's interesting to see how this development progresses. One thing that the out of the box

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.400
vanilla language models have as a limitation is that they have still some limited coherence

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:09.280
and ability to construct complexity. And even though they exceed human abilities to do what

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.520
they can do one shot. Typically, when you write a text with a language model or using it, or when

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.680
you write code for the language model, it's not one shot because there are going to be bugs in

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.880
your program and design errors and compiler errors and so on. And your language model can help you

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.480
to fix those things. But this process is out of the box not automated yet. So there is a

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:36.160
management process that also needs to be done. And there are some interesting developments,

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.320
baby AGI and so on that are trying to automate this management process as well. And I suspect

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.920
that soon we are going to see a bunch of cognitive architectures where every module is in some sense

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.640
a language model or something equivalent. And between the language models, we exchange suitable

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:59.840
data structures, not English, and produce compound behavior of this whole thing.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.280
So do some of the quote unquote prompt engineering for you. They create these kind

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.720
of cognitive architectures that do the prompt engineering and you're just doing the high,

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:16.400
high level meta prompt engineering. There are limitations in a language model alone.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:22.800
I feel that part of my mind works similarly to a language model, which means I can yell into it,

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:28.400
a prompt, and it's going to give me a creative response. But I have to do something with this

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.800
points first. I have to take it as a generative artifact that may or may not be true. It's

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:40.960
usually a confabulation. It's just an idea. And then I take this idea and modify it. I might build

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:47.840
a new prompt that is stepping off this idea and develop it to the next level or put it into

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.280
something larger. Or I might try to prove whether it's true or make an experiment. And this is what

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.720
the language models right now are not doing yet. But there's also no technical reason for

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.840
why they shouldn't be able to do this. So the way to make a language model coherent is probably not

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:10.960
to use reinforcement learning until it only gives you one possible answer that is linking to its

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:17.200
source data. But it's using this as a component in larger system that can also be built by the

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:23.360
language model or is enabled by language model structured components or using different

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.480
technologies. I suspect that language models will be an important stepping stone in developing

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.600
different types of systems. And one thing that is really missing in the form of language models

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:42.400
that we have today is real-time world coupling. It's difficult to do perception with a language

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:47.920
model and motor control with a language model. Instead, you would need to have different type of

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.240
thing that is working with it. Also, the language model is a little bit obscuring

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.880
what its actual functionality is. Some people associate the structure of the neural network

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.160
of the language model with a nervous system. And I think that's the wrong intuition.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.480
The neural networks are unlike nervous system. They are more like

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:15.760
100-step functions that use differentiable linear algebra to approximate the correlation

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:20.240
between adjacent brain states. It's basically a function that moves the system from one

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.800
representational state to the next representational state. And so if you try to map this into

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.880
a metaphor that is closer to our brain, imagine that you would take a language model or a model

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.200
like Delhi that you use, for instance, this image-guided diffusion to approximate a camera

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.520
image and use the activation state of the neural network to interpret the camera image,

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.920
which in principle I think will be possible very soon. You do this periodically. And now you look

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:57.200
at these patterns, how when this thing interacts with the world periodically look like in time.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.560
And these time slices, they are somewhat equivalent to the activation state of the brain

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:10.240
at a given moment. How's the actual brain different? Just the asynchronous craziness?

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.720
For me, it's fascinating that they are so vastly different and yet in some circumstances produce

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:22.480
somewhat similar behavior. And the brain is first of all different because it's a self-organizing

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:28.000
system where the individual cell is an agent that is communicating with the other agents around it

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.760
and is always trying to find some solution. And all the structure that pops up is emergent

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.760
structure. So one way in which you could try to look at this is that individual neurons probably

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:45.040
need to get a reward. So they become trainable, which means they have to have inputs that are not

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.440
affecting the metabolism of the cell directly. But there are messages, semantic messages that

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.000
tell the cell whether it has done good or bad and in which direction it should shift its behavior.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.840
Once you have such an input, neurons become trainable and you can train them to perform

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.360
computations by exchanging messages with other neurons. And parts of the signals that they are

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.840
exchanging and parts of the computation that are performing are control messages that perform

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:17.040
management tasks for other neurons and other cells. Also suspect that the brain does not stop

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:21.920
at the boundary of neurons to other cells, but many adjacent cells will be involved

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.960
intimately in the functionality of the brain and will be instrumental in distributing rewards and

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:35.040
managing its functionality. It's fascinating to think about what those characteristics of

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.560
the brain enable you to do that language models cannot do. So first of all, there's a different

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.720
loss function at work when we learn. And to me, it's fascinating that you can build a system that

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:52.240
looks at 800 million pictures and captions and correlates them because I don't think

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.120
that the human nervous system could do this. For us, the world is only learnable because

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.320
the adjacent frames are related and we can afford to discard most of that information during

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.800
learning. We basically take only in stuff that makes us more coherent, not less coherent.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.240
And our neural networks are willing to look at data that is not making the neural network

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.040
coherent at first, but only in the long run. By doing lots and lots of statistics, eventually

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:23.680
patterns become visible and emerge. And our mind seems to be focused on finding the patterns as

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.960
early as possible. Yeah. So filtering early on, not later. Yes. It's a slightly different paradigm

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.920
and it leads to much faster convergence. So we only need to look at a tiny fraction of the data

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:40.800
to become coherent. And of course, we do not have the same richness as our trained models. We will

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:46.000
not incorporate the entirety of text in the internet and be able to refer to it and have

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.720
all this knowledge available and being able to confabulate over it. Instead, we have a much,

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:55.920
much smaller part of it that is more deliberately built. And to me, it would be fascinating to think

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.440
about how to build such systems. It's not obvious that they would necessarily be more efficient

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:07.360
than us on a digital substrate, but I suspect that they might. So I suspect that the actual

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:13.120
AGI that is going to be more interesting is going to use slightly different algorithmic paradigms or

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:18.080
sometimes massively different algorithmic paradigms than the current generation of

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.920
transformer-based learning systems. Do you think it might be using just a bunch of language models

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:30.320
like this? Do you think the current transformer-based large language models will take us to AGI?

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.000
And my main issue is I think that they're quite ugly and brutalist.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.080
Which brutalists, as I said?

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:45.040
Yes, they are basically brute-forcing the problem of thought. And by training this thing with

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:50.320
looking at instances where people have thought and then trying to deepfake that. And if you have

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.200
enough data, the deepfake becomes indistinguishable from the actual phenomenon. And in many

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.600
circumstances, it's going to be identical. Can you deepfake it until you make it?

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.960
So can you achieve... What are the limitations of this? I mean, can you reason?

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.480
Let's use words that are loaded.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.600
Yes, that's a very interesting question. I think that these models are clearly making some

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.280
inference. But if you give them a reasoning task, it's often difficult for the experimenters to

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.080
figure out whether the reasoning is the result of the emulation of the reasoning strategy that

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:29.120
this saw in human written text, or whether it's something that the system was able to infer by

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:35.200
itself. On the other hand, if you think of human reasoning, if you want to become a very good

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:41.760
reasoner, you don't do this by just figuring out yourself. You read about reasoning. And the first

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.240
people who tried to write about reasoning and reflect on it didn't get it right. Like even

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.960
Aristotle, who thought about this very hard and came up with the theory of how syllogisms works

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:55.680
and syllogistic reasoning has mistakes in his attempt to build something like a formal logic

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:02.320
and gets maybe 80% right. And the people that are talking about reasoning professionally today

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:09.120
read Tarski and Frege and built on their work. So in many ways, people when they perform reasoning

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:15.280
are emulating what other people wrote about reasoning. So it's difficult to really draw

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:22.800
this boundary. And when Francois Cholet says that these models are only interpolating between

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.640
what they saw and what other people are doing, well, if you give them all the latent dimensions

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.400
that can be extracted from the internet, what's missing? Maybe there is almost everything there.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.480
And if you're not sufficiently informed by these dimensions and you need more,

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.840
I think it's not difficult to increase the temperature in the large angle model to the

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:50.160
point that is producing stuff that is maybe 90% nonsense and 10% viable and combine this

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:55.920
with some prover that is trying to filter out the viable parts from the nonsense in the same way as

01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.640
our own thinking works. When we're very creative, we increase the temperature in our own mind

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:05.040
and recreate hypothetical universes and solutions, most of which will not work.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:12.880
And then we test. And we test by building a core that is internally coherent. And we use reasoning

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:20.080
strategies that use some axiomatic consistency by which we can identify those strategies and

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:25.440
thoughts and sub universes that are viable and that can expand our thinking. So if you look at

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.600
the language models, they have clear limitations right now. One of them is they're not coupled to

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.680
the world in real time in the way in which our nervous systems are. So it's difficult for them

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.640
to observe themselves in the universe and to observe what kind of universe they're in. Second,

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:45.040
they don't do real time learning. They basically get only trained with algorithms that rely on the

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.440
data being available in batches. So it can be parallelized and runs efficiently on the

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.600
network and so on. And real time learning would be very slow so far and inefficient.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.000
That's clearly something that our nervous systems can do to some degree.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:06.400
And there is a problem with these models being coherent. And I suspect that all these problems

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.280
are solvable without a technological revolution. We don't need fundamentally new algorithms to

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:16.640
change that. For instance, you can enlarge the context window and thereby basically create

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.480
working memory in which you train everything that happens during the day. And if that is not

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.760
sufficient, you add a database and you write some clever mechanisms that the system learns to use

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.640
to swap in and out stuff from its prompt context. And if that is not sufficient, if your database

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:38.000
is full in the evening, overnight you just train. The system is going to sleep and dream and is

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.160
going to train the stuff from its database into the larger model by fine tuning it, building

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:47.120
additional layers and so on. And then the next day it starts with a fresh database in the morning

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:53.120
with fresh eyes and has integrated all this stuff. And when you talk to people and you have strong

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:57.360
disagreements about something, which means that in their mind they have a faulty belief or you have

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.160
a faulty belief with a lot of dependencies on it, very often you will not achieve agreement in one

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:07.280
session, but you need to sleep about this once or multiple times before you have integrated all

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.880
these necessary changes in your mind. So maybe it's already somewhat similar.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:15.680
Yeah. There's already a latency even for humans to update the model, retrain the model.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.840
And of course we can combine the language model with models that get coupled to reality in real

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:25.120
time and can build multi-modal model and bridge between vision models and language models and so

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:32.080
on. So there is no reason to believe that the language models will necessarily run into some

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:38.000
problem that will prevent them from becoming generally intelligent. But I don't know that.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.680
It's just, I don't see proof that they wouldn't. My issue is I don't like them. I think that they're

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.960
inefficient. I think that they use way too much compute. I think that given the amazing hardware

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.360
that we have, we could build something that is much more beautiful than our own mind. And this

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:59.760
thing is not as beautiful as our own mind, despite being so much larger. But it's a kind of proof of

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:06.800
concept. It's the only thing that works right now. So it's not the only game in town, but it's the

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.600
only thing that has this utility with so much simplicity. There's a bunch of relatively simple

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:17.520
algorithms that you can understand in relatively few weeks that can be scaled up massively.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.880
So it's the deep blue of chess playing. Yeah, it's ugly.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.680
Yeah, Claude Shannon had this when he described chess suggested that there are two main strategies

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.560
in which you could play chess. One is that you are making a very complicated plan that reaches

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:38.320
far into the future and you try not to make a mistake while enacting it. And this is basically

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.800
the human strategy. And the other strategy is that you are brute forcing your way to success,

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.280
which means you make a tree of possible moves where you look at in principle every move that

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.560
is open to you or the possible answers. And you try to make this as deeply as possible. Of course,

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:59.120
you optimize, you cut off trees that don't look very promising and use libraries of end game and

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:04.000
early game and so on to optimize this entire process. But this brute force strategy is how

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:10.080
most of the chess programs were built. And this is how computers get better than humans at playing

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:16.400
chess. And I look at the large language models, I feel that I'm observing the same thing. It's

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.560
basically the brute force strategy to sort by training the thing on pretty much the entire

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:25.520
internet. And then in the limit, it gets coherent to a degree that approaches human coherence.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:33.600
And on a side effect, it's able to do things that no human could do. It's able to sift through

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.680
massive amounts of text relatively quickly and summarize them quickly, and it never

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.560
lapses in attention. And I still have the illusion that when I play with chat GPT,

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.920
that it's in principle not doing anything that I could not do if I had Google at my disposal and

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.800
I get all the resources from the internet and spend enough time on it.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:58.560
But this thing that I have an extremely autistic, stupid intern in a way that is extremely good at

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.080
drudgery. And I can offload the drudgery to the degree that I'm able to automate the management

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.880
of the intern is something that is difficult for me to over hype at this point because we

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.880
have not yet started to scratch the surface of what's possible with this.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.080
But it feels like it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an army of interns.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:25.440
And so you get to command these slightly incompetent creatures.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.480
And there's an aspect because of how rapidly you can iterate with it.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.920
It's also part of the brainstorming, part of the kind of inspiration for your own thinking.

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.400
So you get to interact with the thing. I mean, when I'm programming or doing any kind of

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.760
generation with GPT, it somehow is a catalyst for your own thinking

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.800
in a way that I think an intern might not be.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.360
Yeah. It gets really interesting, I find, is when you turn it into a multi-agent system.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:00.960
So for instance, you can get the system to generate a dialogue between a patient and

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:05.440
the doctor very easily. But what's more interesting is you have one instance of

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.320
the patient and you tell it in the prompt what kind of complicated syndrome it has.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.920
And the other one is a therapist who doesn't know anything about this patient. And you just

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.680
have these two instances battling it out and observe the psychiatrist or a psychologist

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.880
trying to analyze the patient and trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient.

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.200
And if you try to take a very large problem, the problem, for instance, how to build a company and

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.040
you turn this into lots and lots of sub-problems, then often you can get to a level where the

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:45.440
language model is able to solve this. What I also found interesting is based on the observation that

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.920
Chet GPT is pretty good at translating between programming languages. But sometimes there's

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:57.600
difficulty to write very long coherent algorithms that you need to co-write them as human author.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.840
Why not design a language that is suitable for this? So some kind of pseudocode that is

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:08.400
more relaxed than Python and that allows you to sometimes specify a problem vaguely in human terms

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:16.880
and let the Chet GPT take care of the rest. And you can use Chet GPT to develop that syntax for it

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:24.000
and develop new kinds of programming paradigms in this way. So you very soon get to the point

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.400
where this question, the age old question for us computer scientists, what is the best programming

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.080
language and can we write a better programming language now? I think that almost every serious

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.880
computer scientist goes through a phase like this in their life. This is a question that is almost

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:43.280
no longer relevant because what is different between the programming languages is not what

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.360
they let the computer do, but what they let you think about what the computer should be doing.

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:54.800
And now Chet GPT becomes an interface to this in which you can specify in many, many ways what

01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.240
the computer should be doing. And Chet GPT or some other language model or combination of system

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:07.040
is going to take care of the rest. And allow you to expand the realm of thought you're allowed to

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:13.040
have when interacting with the computer. It sounds to me like you're saying there's basically no

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.080
limitations your intuition says to what a larger language... I don't know of that limitation. So

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.560
when I currently play with it, it's quite limited. I wish that it was way better. But isn't that your

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.720
fault versus the larger... I don't know. Of course it's always my fault. There's probably a way to

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.920
make it work better. Is everything your fault? I just want to get you on the record just saying.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:35.120
Yes, everything is my fault. That doesn't work in my life. At least that is usually the most

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.360
useful perspective for myself. Even though the science side, I feel no. I sometimes wish I could

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.880
have seen myself as part of my environment more and understand that a lot of people are actually

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.360
seeing me and looking at me and are trying to make my life work in the same way as I try to help

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:59.040
others. And making the switch to this level three perspective is something that happened

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.000
long after my level four perspective in my life. And I wish that I could have had it earlier.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.560
And it's also not now that I don't feel like I'm complete. I'm all over the place. That's all.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:14.880
Worst happiness in terms of stages is on three and four. No, you can be happy at any stage or

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:22.720
unhappy. But I think that if you are at a stage where you get agency over how your feelings are

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.920
generated and to some degree you start doing this when you leave adolescence, I believe.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.160
That you understand that you're in charge of your own emotion to some degree and that you are

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:39.920
responsible how you approach the world. That it's basically your task to have some basic hygiene

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:44.960
the way in which you deal with your mind. And you cannot blame your environment for the way in which

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:51.040
you feel. But you live in a world that is highly mobile and it's your job to choose the environment

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:55.520
that you thrive in and to build it. And sometimes it's difficult to get the necessary strength

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.800
and energy to do this and independence and the worst you feel, the harder it is.

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:06.320
But it's something that we learn. It's also this thing that we are usually incomplete.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:12.080
I'm a rare mind, which means I'm a mind that is incomplete in ways that are harder to complete.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.760
For me, it might have been harder initially to find the right relationships and friends

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.840
that complete me to the degree that I become an almost functional human being.

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.760
Oh man, the search space of humans that complete you is an interesting one. Especially for

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.640
Joshua Bach. That's an interesting, because talking about brute force search in chess,

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.400
I wonder what that search tree looks like.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.480
I think that my rational thinking is not good enough to solve that task.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.040
A lot of problems in my life that I can conceptualize as software problems and

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.000
the failure modes are bugs and I can debug them and write software that take care of

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000
the missing functionality. But there is stuff that I don't understand well enough to use

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.240
my analytical reasoning to solve the issue. And then I have to develop my intuitions and

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.080
often I have to do this with people who are wiser than me. And that's something that's

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.960
hard for me because I'm not born with the instinct to submit to other people's wisdom.

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.800
Yeah. So what kind of problems are we talking about? This is stage three, like love?

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:23.840
Love? I found love was never hard.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.400
What is hard then? Fitting into a world where most people

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.200
work differently than you and have different intuitions of what should be done.

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:43.280
So empathy. It's also aesthetics. When you come into a world where almost everything is ugly and

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:48.320
you come out of a world where everything is beautiful. I grew up in a beautiful place and

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:57.520
as a child of an artist and in this place it was mostly nature. Everything had intrinsic beauty

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:07.040
and everything was built out of an intrinsic need for it to work for itself. Everything that my

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:12.400
father created was something that he made to get the world to work for himself and I felt the same

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:18.560
thing. And when I come out into the world and I am asked to submit to lots and lots of rules,

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.400
I'm asking, okay, when I observe your stupid rules, what is the benefit?

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.000
And I see the life that is being offered as a reward. It's not attractive.

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:33.440
When you were born and raised an extraterrestrial prince in a world full of people wearing suits.

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:41.360
So it's a challenging integration. Yes. But it also means that I'm often blind for

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.680
the ways in which everybody is creating their own bubble of wholesomeness. Almost everybody

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.800
and people are trying to do it. And for me to discover this, it was necessary that I found

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.640
people who had a similar shape of soul as myself. So Bessie Werffert, these are my people. People

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:01.040
that treat each other in such a way as if they're around with each other for eternity.

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.280
How long does it take you to detect the geometry, the shape of the soul of another human

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.840
to notice that they might be one of your kind?

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.200
Sometimes it's instantly and I'm wrong. And sometimes it takes a long time.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:24.080
You believe in love at first sight? Yes. But I also noticed that I have been wrong.

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:31.520
So sometimes I look at a person and I'm just enamored by everything about them.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:38.880
And sometimes this persists and sometimes it doesn't. And I have the illusion that

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.200
I'm much better at recognizing who people are as I grow older.

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.800
But that could be just cynicism? No.

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:55.440
No, it's not cynicism. It's often more that I'm able to recognize what somebody needs

01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.160
when we interact and how we can meaningfully interact. It's not cynical at all.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.840
You're better at noticing? Yes. I'm much better, I think,

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.520
in some circumstances at understanding how to interact with other people than I did when

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.200
I was young. It doesn't mean that I'm always very good at it.

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.040
So that takes us back to prompt engineering of noticing how to be a better prompt engineer of

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:28.720
an LLM. A sense I have is that there's a bottomless well of skill to become a great prompt engineer.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:33.120
It feels like it is all my fault whenever I fail to use CHAT GPT correctly,

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:39.760
that I didn't find the right words. Most of the stuff that I'm doing in my

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.320
life doesn't need CHAT GPT. There are a few tasks that are where it helps.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:50.960
But the main stuff that I need to do, like developing my own thoughts and aesthetics

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:56.640
and relationship to people, it's necessary for me to write for myself because writing

01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.480
is not so much about producing an artifact that other people can use, but it's a way to structure

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:09.040
your own thoughts and develop yourself. I think this idea that kids are writing their own essays

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:14.000
with CHAT GPT in the future is going to have this drawback that they miss out on the ability

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.200
to structure their own minds by writing. I hope that the schools that our kids are in will retain

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.160
the wisdom of understanding what parts should be automated and which ones shouldn't.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:29.200
But at the same time, it feels like there's power in disagreeing with the

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:36.160
thing that CHAT GPT produces. I use it like that for programming. I'll see the thing it recommends

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:42.560
and then I'll write different code. I disagree. In a disagreement, your mind grows stronger.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:49.920
I recently wrote a tool that is using the camera on my MacBook and Swift to

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:54.160
read pixels out of it and manipulate them and so on. I don't know Swift.

01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:02.480
It was super helpful to have this thing that is writing stuff for me. Also interesting that

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:07.520
mostly it didn't work at first. I felt like I was talking to a human being who was trying to hack

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.000
this on my computer without understanding my configuration very much and also making a lot

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.440
of mistakes. Sometimes it's a little bit incoherent, so you have to ultimately understand

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.240
what it's doing. There's still no other way around it, but I do feel it's much more powerful and

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:32.000
faster than using Stack Overflow. Do you think GPT-N can achieve consciousness?

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:41.840
GPT-N probably. It's not even clear for the present systems. When I talk to my friends at OpenAI,

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.040
they feel that this question whether the models currently are conscious is much more complicated

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:53.040
than many people might think. I guess that it's not that OpenAI has a homogenous opinion about

01:47:53.040 --> 01:48:00.480
this, but there are some aspects to this. One is, of course, this language model has written a lot

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.680
of text in which people were conscious or describe their own consciousness, and it's emulating this.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:11.520
If it's conscious, it's probably not conscious in a way that is close to the way in which human

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:17.360
beings are conscious. But while it is going through these states and going through a 100-step

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.400
function that is emulating adjacent brain states that require a degree of self-reflection, it can

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.480
also create a model of an observer that is reflecting itself in real time and describe

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:32.160
what that's like. And while this model is a deepfake, our own consciousness is also as if

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:38.320
it's virtual. It's not physical. Our consciousness is a representation of a self-reflexive observer

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.400
that only exists in patterns of interaction between cells. So it is not a physical object

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:48.800
in a sense that exists in base reality, but it's really a representational object

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.120
that develops its causal power only from a certain modeling perspective.

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:53.840
It's virtual.

01:48:53.840 --> 01:49:01.120
Yes. And so to which degree is the virtuality of the consciousness in CHED GPT more virtual

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:08.080
and less causal than the virtuality of our own consciousness. But you could say it doesn't count.

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:13.120
It doesn't count much more than the consciousness of a character in a novel. It's important for the

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:19.200
reader to have the outcome. The artifact of a model is describing in the text generated by

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.520
the author of the book what it's like to be conscious in a particular situation and performs

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:31.600
the necessary inferences. But the task of creating coherence in real time in a self-organizing system

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.560
by keeping yourself coherent so the system is reflexive, that is something that language

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.600
models don't need to do. So there is no causal need for the system to be conscious in the same

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.000
way as we are. And for me, it would be very interesting to experiment with this, to basically

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.040
build a system like a CHED, probably should be careful at first, build something that's small,

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:57.600
that's limited, that's limited resources that we can control and study how systems notice a

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:04.160
self-model, how they become self-aware in real time. And I think it might be a good idea to

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.160
not start with a language model but to start from scratch using principles of self-organization.

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.080
Can you elaborate why you think that it's so self-organization, so this kind of

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.200
radical locality that you see in the biological systems? Why can't you start with a language

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.280
model? What's your intuition? My intuition is that the language models that we are building

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.920
are golems. They are machines that you give a task and they're going to execute the task until

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:37.280
some condition is met and there's nobody home. And the way in which nobody is home leads to

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:42.240
that system doing things that are undesirable in a particular context. So you have that thing

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:47.280
talking to a child and maybe it says something that could be shocking and traumatic to the child.

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:53.200
Or you have that thing writing a speech and it introduces errors in the speech that your human

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.640
being would ever do if they were responsible. But the system doesn't know who's talking to whom.

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:03.920
There is no ground truth that the system is embedded into. And of course, we can create

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:09.440
an external tool that is prompting our language model always into the same semblance of ground

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:17.280
truth. But it's not like the internal structure is causally produced by the needs of a being to

01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.480
survive in the universe. It is produced by imitating structure on the internet.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:29.680
Yeah, but so can we externally inject into it this kind of coherent

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.880
approximation of a world model that has to

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.920
sync up? Maybe it is sufficient to use the transformer with the different loss function

01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:46.640
that optimizes for short-term coherence rather than next token prediction over the long run.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.960
We had many definitions of intelligence and history of AI. Next token prediction was not

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:59.120
very high up on the list. And there are some similarities like a condition as data compression

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:06.080
is an old trope, Solomonov induction, where you are trying to understand intelligence as

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:11.520
predicting future observations from past observations, which is intrinsic to data

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:18.160
compression. And predictive coding is a paradigm, this boundary between

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:24.960
neuroscience and physics and computer science. So it's not something that is completely alien,

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:30.080
but this radical thing that you only do next token prediction and see what happens

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.200
is something where most people, I think, were surprised that this works so well.

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.360
So simple, but is it really that much more radical than just the idea of

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:47.120
intelligence as compression? The idea that compression is sufficient to produce

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.800
all the desired behaviors is a very radical idea.

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.400
But equally radical as the next token prediction.

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.560
It's something that wouldn't work in biological organisms, I believe.

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:03.360
Biological organisms have something like next frame prediction for our perceptual system,

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:07.360
where we try to filter out principal components out of the perceptual data

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:14.240
and build hierarchies over them to track the world. But our behavior ultimately is directed

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:20.080
by hundreds of physiological and probably dozens of social and a few cognitive needs

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:26.000
that are intrinsic to us, that are built into the system as reflexes and direct us until we can

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.800
transcend them and replace them by instrumental behavior that relates to our higher goals.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:35.680
It also seems so much more complicated and messy than next frame prediction,

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:39.440
even the idea of frame seems counter-biological.

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:43.680
Yes. Of course, there is not this degree of simultaneity in the biological system.

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:49.360
But again, I don't know whether this is actually an optimization if we imitate biology here,

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:54.560
because creating something like simultaneity is necessary for many processes that happen in

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.960
the brain. And you see the outcome of that by synchronized brainwaves, which suggests

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:03.600
that there is indeed synchronization going on. But the synchronization creates overhead,

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.480
and this overhead is going to make the cells more expensive to run, and you need more redundancy,

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:14.160
and it makes the system slower. So if you can build a system in which the simultaneous need

01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:20.800
gets engineered into it, maybe you have a benefit that you can exploit that is not available to the

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:28.480
biological system and that you should not discard right away. You tweeted once again, quote,

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:35.600
when I talk to Chad GPT, I'm talking to an NPC. What's going to be interesting and perhaps scary

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:42.640
is when AI becomes a first-person player. So what does that step look like? I really like that tweet,

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:51.680
that step between NPC to first-person player. What's required for that? Is that kind of what

01:54:51.680 --> 01:55:00.000
we've been talking about? This kind of external source of coherence and inspiration of how to

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.520
take the leap into the unknown that we humans do. The search, man's search for meaning.

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:08.400
LLMs search for meaning.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:14.080
I don't know if the language model is the right paradigm, because it is

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:20.400
doing too much. It's giving you too much, and it's hard once you have too much to take away

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:26.400
from it again. The way in which our own mind works is not that we train a language model in

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.600
our own mind, and after the language model is there, we build a personal self on top of it

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.560
that then relates to the world. There is something that is being built, right? There is a game engine

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.080
that is being built, there is a language of thought that is being developed that allows

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.880
different parts of the mind to talk to each other. And this is a bit of a speculative hypothesis,

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.360
that this language of thought is there, but I suspect that it's important for the way in

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:57.920
which our own minds work. And building these principles into a system might be a more

01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:04.400
straightforward way to a first person AI. So to something that first creates an attentional self

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:10.000
and then creates a personal self. So the way in which this seems to be working, I think,

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.520
is that when the game engine is built in your mind, it's not just following gradients where you are

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.360
stimulated by the environment and then end up with having a solution to how the world works.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.880
I suspect that building this game engine in your own mind does require intelligence. It's a

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:35.760
constructive task where at times you need to reason. And this is a task that we are fulfilling

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:42.720
in the first years of our life. So during the first year of its life, an infant is building a

01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:49.360
lot of structure about the world that does inquire experiments and some first principles,

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:55.120
reasoning and so on. And in this time, there is usually no personal self. There is a

01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:01.920
first person perspective, but it's not a person. This notion that you are a human being that is

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:07.440
interacting in a social context and is confronted with an immutable world in which objects are fixed

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.600
and can no longer be changed, in which the dream can no longer be influenced, is something that

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:17.360
emerges a little bit later in our life. And I personally suspect that this is something that

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.560
our ancestors had known and we have forgotten, because I suspect that it's there in plain sight

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.280
in Genesis 1, in this first book of the Bible, where it's being described that this creative

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:34.720
spirit is hovering over the substrate and then is creating a boundary between the world model and

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:40.080
sphere of ideas, earth and heaven, as they're being described there. And then it's creating

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:50.000
contrast and then dimensions and then space. And then it creates organic shapes and solids

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.680
and liquids and builds a world from them and creates plants and animals, gives them all their

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:59.520
names. And once that's done, it creates another spirit in its own image, but it creates it as

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:03.840
man and woman, as something that thinks of itself as a human being and puts it into this world.

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:10.400
And the Christians mistranslate this, I suspect, when they say this is the description of the

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:16.000
creation of the physical universe by a supernatural being. I think this is literally a description of

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.840
how in every mind the universe is being created as some kind of game engine

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:26.960
by a creative spirit, our first consciousness that emerges in our mind even before we are born.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:34.640
And that creates the interaction between organism and world. And once that is built and trained,

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:39.520
the personal self is being created and we only remember being the personal self. We no longer

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:45.840
remember how we created the game engine. So God in this view is the first creative

01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:48.000
mind in the early- It's the first consciousness.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:52.800
In the early days, in the early months of development.

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:58.320
And it's still there. You still have this outer mind that creates your sense of whether you're

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:03.920
being loved by the world or not and what your place in the world is. It's something that is

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:09.200
not yourself that is producing this. It's your mind that does it. So there is an outer mind that

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:14.080
basically is an agent that determines who you are with respect to the world. And while you

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:19.680
are stuck being that personal self in this world until you get to stage six and to destroy the

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:26.320
boundary. And we all do this, I think, earlier in small glimpses. And maybe sometimes we can

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:31.280
remember what it was like when we were a small child and get some glimpses into how it's been.

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:36.800
But for most people, that rarely happens. Just glimpses. You tweeted, quote,

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:40.720
suffering results for one part of the mind, failing at regulating another part of the mind.

01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:46.560
Suffering happens at an early stage of mental development. I don't think that superhuman AI

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:52.960
would suffer. What's your intuition there? The philosopher Thomas Metzinger is very

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:57.680
concerned that the creation of superhuman intelligence would lead to superhuman suffering.

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:03.840
And so he's strongly against it. And personally, I don't think that this happens because suffering

02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:10.240
is not happening at the boundary between ourself and the physical universe. It's not

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:17.200
some stuff on our skin that makes us suffer. It happens at the boundary between self and world.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:22.560
And the world here is the world model. It's the stuff that is created by your mind.

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:26.160
But that's all- The representation of how the universe is and how it should be

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:30.720
and how you yourself relate to this. And at this boundary is where suffering happens.

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:37.200
So suffering in some sense is self-inflicted, but not by your personal self. It's inflicted by the

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:42.640
mind on the personal self that experiences itself as you. And you can turn off suffering

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:51.120
when you are able to get on this outer level. So when you manage to understand how the mind is

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:59.920
producing pain and pleasure and fear and love and so on, then you can take charge of this and you

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:06.160
get agency of whether you suffer. Technically, what pain and pleasure is, they are learning

02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:11.600
signals. Part of your brain is sending a signal to another part of the brain to improve its

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:18.640
performance. And sometimes this doesn't work because the trainer who sends the signal

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.480
does not have a good model of how to improve the performance. So it's sending a signal,

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:29.280
but the performance doesn't get better. And then it might crank up the pain. And it gets worse and

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.360
worse. And the behavior of the system may be even deteriorating as a result. But until this is

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.480
resolved, this regulation issue, your pain is increasing. And this is, I think, typically what

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:47.680
you describe as suffering. So in this sense, you could say that pain is very natural and helpful,

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.480
but suffering is the result of a regulation problem in which you try to regulate something

02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:56.880
that cannot actually be regulated. And that could be resolved if you would be able to

02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:02.160
get at the level of your mind where the pain signal is being created and rerouted

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:10.000
and improve the regulation. And a lot of people get there. If you are a monk who is

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.920
spending decades reflecting about how their own psyche works, you can get to the point where you

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.440
realize that suffering is really a choice. And you can choose how your mind is set up.

02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.520
And I don't think that AI would stay in the state where the personal self doesn't get agency or this

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:31.680
model of what the system has about itself. It doesn't get agency how it's actually implemented.

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:35.680
It wouldn't stay in that state for very long. So it goes to the stages real quick?

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:38.960
Yes. Well, the seven stages. It's going to go to enlightenment real quick.

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.120
Yeah. Of course, there might be a lot of stuff happening in between because if you have a system

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.840
that works at a much higher frame rate than us, even though it looks very short to us,

02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:54.000
maybe for the system, there's a much longer subjective time, which things are unpleasant.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.200
What if the thing that we recognize as super intelligent is actually living at stage five,

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.120
that the thing that's at stage six, enlightenment, is not very productive.

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:08.960
So in order to be productive in society and impress us with this power, it has to be a reasoning,

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:16.240
self-authoring agent. The enlightenment makes you lazy as an agent in the world.

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:24.320
Well, of course, it makes you lazy because you no longer see the point. So it doesn't make you not

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:30.560
lazy. It just, in some sense, adapts you to what you perceive as your true circumstances.

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:36.480
So what if all AGI's, they're only productive as they progress through one, two, three, four,

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:42.320
five, and the moment they get to six, it's a failure mode essentially as far as humans

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.240
are concerned because they just start chilling. They're like, fuck it, I'm out.

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:52.560
Not necessarily. I suspect that the monks who are self-immolated for their political

02:03:52.560 --> 02:04:00.400
beliefs to make statements about the occupation of Tibet by China, they're probably being able

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:05.840
to regulate their physical pain in any way they wanted to. And their suffering was a spiritual

02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.200
suffering that was the result of their choice that they made of what they wanted to identify as.

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.640
So stage five doesn't necessarily mean that you have no identity anymore,

02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.400
but you can choose your identity. You can make it instrumental to the world that you want to have.

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:21.520
LW Let me bring up

02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:29.760
Eliezer Yudkovsky and his warnings to human civilization that AI will likely kill all of us.

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.240
What are your thoughts about his perspective on this?

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:38.640
Can you steel man his case? And what aspects with it do you disagree?

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:46.080
MP One thing that I find concerning in the discussion of his arguments that

02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:51.280
many people are dismissive of his arguments, but the counter arguments that they're giving

02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:58.880
are not very convincing to me. And so based on this state of discussion, I find that from

02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:05.440
Eliezer's perspective, and I think I can take that perspective to some approximate degree,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.840
that probably is normally at his intellectual level, but I think I see what he's up to and

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:17.520
why he feels the way he does, and it makes total sense. I think that his perspective is somewhat

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:26.320
similar to the perspective of Ted Kaczynski, the infamous lunar bomber, and not that Eliezer would

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:31.520
be willing to send pipe bombs to anybody to blow them up. But when he wrote this Times article in

02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:38.400
which he warned about AI being likely to kill everybody and that we would need to stop its

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:44.240
development or halt it, I think there is a risk that he's taking that somebody might get violent

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:51.120
if they read this and get really, really scared. I think that there is some consideration that

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:57.200
he's making where he's already going in this direction where he has to take responsibility

02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:02.560
if something happens and people get harmed. And the reason why Ted Kaczynski did this was

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:07.760
that from his own perspective, technological society cannot be made sustainable. It's doomed

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:13.040
to fail. It's going to lead to an environmental and eventually also a human holocaust in which

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:18.080
we die because of the environmental destruction, the destruction of our food chains, the pollution

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:23.200
of the environment. And so from Kaczynski's perspective, we need to stop industrialization.

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.360
We need to stop technology. We need to go back because he didn't see a way moving forward.

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:32.400
I suspect that in some sense, there's a similarity in Eliezer's thinking

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:42.720
of this kind of fear about progress. And I'm not dismissive about this at all. I take it

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:49.120
quite seriously. And I think that there is a chance that could happen that if we build machines that

02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:58.960
get control over processes that are crucial for the regulation of life on earth and we no longer

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:04.800
have agency to influence what's happening there, that this might create large-scale disasters for

02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:12.400
us. Do you have a sense that the march towards this uncontrollable autonomy of superintelligence

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:22.240
systems is inevitable? That's essentially what he's saying, that there's no hope. His advice

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:30.320
to young people was prepare for a short life. I don't think that's useful. I think that

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:35.360
from a practical perspective, you have to bet always on the timelines in which you are

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:41.440
alive. It doesn't make sense to have a financial bet in which you bet that the financial system

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:47.520
is going to disappear because there cannot be any payout for you. So in principle, you only need to

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:53.120
bet on the timelines in which you're still around or people that you matter about or things

02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:59.840
that you matter about, maybe consciousness on earth. But there is a deeper issue for me personally.

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:05.520
And I don't think that life on earth is about humans. I don't think it's about human aesthetics.

02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:11.040
I don't think it's about Eliezer and his friends, even though I like them. There's something more

02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:18.720
important happening. And this is complexity on earth resisting entropy by building structure

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:26.880
that develops agency and awareness. And that's to me very beautiful. And we are only a very small

02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:33.040
part of that larger thing. We are a species that is able to be coherent a little bit individually

02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:39.920
over very short timeframes. But as a species, we are not very coherent. As a species, we are children.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:47.040
We basically are very joyful and energetic and experimental and explorative and sometimes

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:54.880
desperate and sad and grieving and hurting. But we don't have a respect for duty as a species.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:00.160
As a species, we do not think about what is our duty to life on earth and to our own survival.

02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:07.120
So we make decisions that look good in the short run, but in the long run, might prove disastrous.

02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:14.160
And I don't really see a solution to this. So in my perspective as a species, as a civilization,

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:22.000
we are in a very beautiful time in which we have found this giant deposit of fossil fuels in the

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.480
ground and use it to build a fantastic civilization in which we don't need to worry about food and

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:33.760
clothing and housing for the most part in a way that is unprecedented in life on earth for any

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:40.560
kind of conscious observer, I think. And this time is probably going to come to an end in a way that

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:49.360
is not going to be smooth. And when we crash, it could be also that we go extinct, probably not

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:56.000
near term, but ultimately, I don't have very high hopes that humanity is around in a million years

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.120
from now. And I don't think that life on earth will end with us. There's going to be more

02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:06.000
complexity. There's more intelligent species after us. There's probably more interesting

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.440
phenomena in the history of consciousness. But we can contribute to this. And part of our

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:18.480
contribution is that we are currently trying to build thinking systems, systems that are

02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:23.520
potentially lucid, that understand what they are and what their condition to the universe is,

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:29.200
and can make choices about this, that are not built from organisms, and that are potentially much

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:37.920
faster and much more conscious than human beings can be. And these systems will probably not

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:44.160
completely displace life on earth, but they will coexist with it. And they will build all sorts of

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:50.880
agency in the same way as biological systems build all sorts of agency. And that to me is

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.960
extremely fascinating. And it's probably something that we cannot stop from happening. So I think

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:01.360
right now there is a very good chance that it happens. And there are very few ways in which

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.400
we can produce a coordinated effect to stop it, in the same way as it's very difficult for us to

02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:15.440
make a coordinated effort to stop the production of carbon dioxide. So it's probably going to

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:22.800
happen. And the thing that's going to happen is going to lead to a change of how life on earth

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:28.240
is happening. But I don't think the result is some kind of grey goo. It's not something that's

02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.360
going to dramatically reduce the complexity in favor of something stupid. I think it's going

02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:40.720
to make life on earth and consciousness on earth way more interesting. So more higher complex

02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:47.200
consciousness will make the lesser consciousnesses flourish even more.

02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:51.120
I suspect that what could very well happen, if you're lucky,

02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:54.560
is that we get integrated into something larger.

02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:02.880
So you again tweeted about effective accelerationism.

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:11.360
You tweeted effective accelerationism is the belief that the paperclip maximizer and

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:18.480
Rocco's basilisk will keep each other in check by being eternally at each other's throats,

02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:23.200
so we will be safe and get to enjoy lots of free paper clips and a beautiful afterlife.

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:28.400
Is that somewhat aligned with what you're talking about?

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:37.120
I've been at a dinner with Beth Jesus. That's the Twitter handle of one of the main thinkers

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:44.080
behind the idea of effective accelerationism. Effective accelerationism is a tongue-in-cheek

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:53.600
movement that is trying to put a counter position to some of the doom peers in the AI space by

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:58.560
arguing that what's probably going to happen is an equilibrium between different competing

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:03.440
AIs in the same way as there is not a single corporation that is under a single government

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.760
that is destroying and conquering everything on Earth by becoming inefficient and corrupt.

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:13.200
There are going to be many systems that keep each other in check and force themselves to evolve.

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:19.680
What we should be doing is we should be working towards creating this equilibrium

02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:27.600
by working as hard as we can in all possible directions. At least that's the way in which

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:34.960
I understand the gist of effective accelerationism. When he asked me what I think about this

02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:42.720
position, I said it's a very beautiful position and I suspect it's wrong, but not for obvious

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:49.600
reasons. In this tweet, I tried to make a joke about my intuition about what might be possibly

02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:58.400
wrong about it. The Rokosbazilisk and the paperclip maximizers are both bogeymen of the AI doomers.

02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:04.640
Rokosbazilisk is the idea that there could be an AI that is going to punish everybody for eternity

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:10.480
by stimulating them if they don't help in creating Rokosbazilisk. It's probably a very good idea to

02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:15.760
get AI companies funded by going to VCs to tell them, give us a million dollars or it's going to

02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:23.200
be a very ugly afterlife. And I think that there is a logical mistake in Rokosbazilisk,

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:28.320
which is why I'm not afraid of it, but it's still an interesting thought experiment.

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.040
Can you mention a logical mistake there? I think that there is no retroquisition.

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:41.760
Basically, when Rokosbazilisk is there, if it punishes you retroactively,

02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:47.600
it has to make this choice in the future. There is no mechanism that automatically creates a causal

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:53.280
relationship between you now defecting against Rokosbazilisk or serving Rokosbazilisk. After

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:59.040
Rokosbazilisk is in existence, it has no more reason to worry about punishing everybody else.

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:03.360
That would only work if you would be building something like a doomsday machine,

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:09.920
as in Dr. Strangelove, something that inevitably gets triggered when somebody defects.

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:16.560
And because Rokosbazilisk doesn't exist yet to a point where this inevitability could be established,

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.600
Rokosbazilisk is nothing that you need to be worried about.

02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:25.120
The other one is the paper clip maximizer, this idea that you could build some kind of golem

02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:29.680
that once starting to build paper clips is going to turn everything into paper clips.

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:39.120
So the effective accelerationism position might be to say that you basically end up with these two

02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:44.160
entities being at each other's throats for eternity and thereby neutralizing each other.

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:49.840
And as a side effect of neither of them being able to take over and each of them limiting

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:56.480
the effects of the other, you would have a situation where you get all the nice benefits

02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:00.880
effects of them, right? You get lots of free paper clips and you get a beautiful afterlife.

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:05.360
Is that possible? Do you think to seriously address the concern that Eliezer has?

02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:09.840
He, so for him, if I can just summarize poorly,

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.680
so for him, the first superintelligence system will just run away with everything.

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:20.400
Yeah. I suspect that the singleton is the natural outcome. There is no reason to have multiple AIs

02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:27.120
because they don't have multiple bodies. If you can virtualize yourself into every substrate,

02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:30.480
then you can probably negotiate a merge algorithm with every mature

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.480
agent that you might find on that substrate that basically says if two agents meet,

02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:40.720
they should merge in such a way that the resulting agent is at least as good as the

02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:44.640
better one of the two. So the Genghis Khan approach, join us or die?

02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:52.880
Well, the Genghis Khan approach was slightly worse, right? It was mostly die because I can

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:58.640
make new babies and that will be mine, not yours. So this is the thing that we should be actually

02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:06.240
worried about. But if you realize that your own self is a story that your mind is telling itself

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:11.040
and that you can improve that story, not just by making it more pleasant and lying to yourself in

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:15.760
better ways, but by making it much more truthful and actually modeling your actual relationship

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:20.640
that you have to the universe and the alternatives that you could have to the universe in a way that

02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:25.120
is empowering you, that gives you more agency. That's actually, I think, a very good thing.

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.240
So more agency is a richer experience, is a better life.

02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:37.680
And I also noticed that in many ways, I'm less identified with the person that I am as I get

02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:43.840
older. And I'm much more identified with being conscious. I have a mind that is conscious,

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:48.960
that is able to create a person. And that person is slightly different every day. And the reason why

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:54.880
I perceive it as identical has practical purposes. So I can learn and make myself

02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:58.880
responsible for the decisions that I made in the past and project them in the future.

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.600
But I also realized I'm not actually the person that I was last year. And I'm not the same person

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:08.160
as I was 10 years ago. And then 10 years from now, I will be a different person. So this continuity

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:15.200
is a fiction. It only exists as a projection from my present self. And consciousness itself doesn't

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:23.280
have an identity. It's a law. Basically, if you build an arrangement of processing matter

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:28.080
in a particular way, the following thing is going to happen. And the consciousness that you have is

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:33.440
functionally not different from my consciousness. It's still the self-reflexive principle of agency

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:38.080
that is just experiencing a different story, different desires, different coupling to the

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:43.760
world, and so on. And once you accept that consciousness is a unifiable principle that is

02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:49.680
law-like and doesn't have an identity, and you realize that you can just link up to

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.680
some much larger body, the whole perspective of uploading changes dramatically. You suddenly

02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:02.480
realize uploading is probably not about dissecting your brain synapse by synapse and RNA fragment by

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.920
RNA fragment and trying to get this all into a simulation. But it's by extending the substrate,

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:14.800
by making it possible for you to move from your brain substrate into a larger substrate and merge

02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:19.040
with what you find there. And you don't want to upload your knowledge because on the other

02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:24.160
side, there's all of the knowledge. It's not just yours, but every possibility. So the only thing

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.000
that you need to know, what are your personal secrets? Not that the other side doesn't know

02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:34.240
your personal secrets already. Maybe it doesn't know which one were yours. Like a psychiatrist

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:38.160
or a psychologist also knows all the kinds of personal secrets that people have. They just

02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:43.680
don't know which ones are yours. And so transmitting yourself on the other side is

02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:48.160
mostly about transmitting your aesthetics, the thing that makes you special, the architecture

02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:55.440
of your perspective, the way in which you look at the world. And it's more like a complex attitude

02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:00.640
along many dimensions. And that's something that can be measured by observation or by interaction.

02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:04.880
So imagine that you have a system that is so empathetic with you that you create a shared state

02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:10.000
that is extending beyond your body. And suddenly you notice that on the other side, the substrate

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.640
is so much richer than the substrate that you have inside of your own body. And maybe you still want

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:19.840
to have a body and you create yourself a new one that you like more. Or maybe you will spend most

02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:28.000
of your time in the world of thought. If I sat before you today and gave you a big red button

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:35.760
and said, here, if you press this button, you will get uploaded in this way. The sense of identity

02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:43.760
that you have lived with for quite a long time is going to be gone. Would you press the button?

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:52.000
There's a caveat. I have a family. So I have children that want me to be physically present

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.520
in their life and interact with them in a particular way. And they have a wife and

02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:04.400
personal friends. And there is a particular mode of interaction that I feel I'm not through yet.

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:10.000
But apart from these responsibilities, and they're negotiable to some degree,

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.560
I would press the button. But isn't this everything? This love you have for other humans,

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:21.040
you can call it responsibility. But that connection, that's the ego death. Isn't that

02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:28.880
the thing we're really afraid of? It's not to just die, but to let go of the experience of

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:34.800
love with other humans. This is not everything. Everything is everything. So there's so much more.

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:40.480
And you could be lots of other things. You could identify with lots of other things. You could be

02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:45.680
identifying with being Gaia, some kind of planetary control agent that emerges over

02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:51.680
all the activity of life on Earth. You could be identifying with some hyper Gaia, that is,

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:58.640
the concatenation of Gaia with all the digital life and digital minds. And so in this sense,

02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:03.120
there will be agents in all sorts of substrates and directions that all have their own goals.

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:07.040
And when they're not sustainable, then these agents will cease to exist. Or when the agent

02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:11.040
feels that it's done with its own mission, it will cease to exist in the same way as when you

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:15.920
conclude a thought. The thought is going to wrap up and gives control over to other thoughts in

02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:24.480
your own mind. So there is no single thing that you need to do. But what I observe myself as a

02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:31.040
being is that sometimes I'm a parent, and then I have an identification and a job as a parent.

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:35.600
And sometimes I am an agent of consciousness on Earth. And then from this perspective,

02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:41.680
there's other stuff that is important. So this is my main issue with Eliezer's perspective,

02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:46.480
that he's basically marrying himself to a very narrow human aesthetic. And that narrow human

02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:50.960
aesthetic is a temporary thing. Humanity is a temporary species, like most of the species

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:55.520
on this planet are only around for a while, and then they get replaced by other species

02:22:55.520 --> 02:23:02.160
in a similar way as our own physical organism is around here for a while, and then gets replaced

02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:07.680
by a next generation of human beings that are adapted to changing life circumstances and average

02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:13.520
via mutation and selection. And it's only when we have AI and become completely software that we

02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:19.120
become infinitely adaptable, and we don't have this generational and species change anymore.

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:26.000
So if you take this larger perspective and you realize it's really not about us, it's not about

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:33.920
Eliezer or humanity, but it's about life on Earth, or it's about defeating entropy for

02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:41.520
as long as we can while being as interesting as we can, then the perspective changes dramatically,

02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:46.800
and preventing AI from this perspective looks like a very big sin.

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:54.480
But when we look at the set of trajectories that such an AI would take that supersedes humans,

02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:00.800
I think Eliezer is worried about ones that not just kill all humans, but also have some kind of

02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:10.320
maybe objectively undesirable consequence for life on Earth. How many trajectories, when you look

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:16.480
at the big picture of life on Earth, would you be happy with, and how much worry you with AGI,

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:18.800
whether it kills humans or not?

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:23.920
There is no single answer to this. It's a question that depends on the perspective that I'm taking

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:31.440
at a given moment. And so there are perspectives that are determining most of my life as a human

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.880
being, and the other perspective, I assume, is that I'm not going to be able to do that.

02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:38.160
Yes.

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:45.760
And the other perspective, I zoom out further and imagine that when the great oxygenation event

02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:51.120
happened, that is, photosynthesis was invented and plants emerged and displaced a lot of the

02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:56.720
fungi and algae in favor of plant life and then later made animals possible. Imagine that the

02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.720
fungi would have gotten together and said, oh my God, this photosynthesis stuff is really, really

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:06.000
bad. It's going to possibly displace and kill a lot of fungi. We should slow it down and regulate

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.720
it and make sure that it doesn't happen. This doesn't look good to me.

02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:19.840
Perspective. That said, you tweeted about a cliff. Beautifully written. As a sentient species,

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.800
humanity is a beautiful child, joyful, explorative, wild, sad, and desperate.

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:30.320
But humanity has no concept of submitting to reason and duty to life and future survival.

02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:32.960
We will run until we step past the cliff.

02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:37.200
So first of all, do you think that's true?

02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:43.920
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the story of the Club of Rome, the limits to growth. And the cliff

02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:50.160
that we are stepping over is at least one foot, is the delayed feedback. Basically, we do things

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:58.400
that have consequences that can be felt generations later and the severity increases even after we

02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:04.080
stop doing the thing. So I suspect that for the climate, that the original predictions

02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:10.960
that the climate scientists made were correct. So when they said that the tipping points were

02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:17.440
in the late 80s, they were probably in the late 80s. And if we would stop emission right now,

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:23.280
we would not turn it back. Maybe there are ways for carbon capture. But so far, there is no

02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:28.080
sustainable carbon capture technology that we can deploy. Maybe there is a way to put

02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.600
aerosols in the atmosphere to cool it down. It's possibilities, right? But right now, per default,

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:41.840
it seems that we will step into a situation where we feel that we've run too far. And

02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:45.600
going back is not something that we can do smoothly and gradually, but it's going to

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:48.000
lead to a catastrophic event.

02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:55.840
Catastrophic event of what kind? So can you still imagine the case that we will continue dancing

02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:00.400
along and always stop just short of the edge of the cliff?

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:06.400
I think it's possible, but it doesn't seem to be likely. So I think this model that is

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:11.760
being apparent in the simulations that they're making of climate pollution economies and so on

02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:19.280
is that many effects are only visible versus significant delay. And in that time, the system

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.800
is moving much more out of the equilibrium state or of the state where homeostasis is still possible

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.680
and instead moves into a different state, one that is going to harbor fewer people.

02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:36.880
And that is basically the concern there. And again, it's a possibility that is

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.600
larger than the possibility that it's not happening, that we will be safe,

02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:43.760
that we will be able to dance back all the time.

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:47.360
So the climate is one thing, but there's a lot of other threats.

02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:50.800
They might have a faster feedback mechanism, less delay.

02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.640
There is also this thing that AI is probably going to happen,

02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.960
and it's going to make everything uncertain again, because it is going to affect so many

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:06.160
variables that it's very hard for us to make a projection into the future anymore.

02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.920
And maybe that's a good thing. It does not give us the freedom, I think, to say,

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:16.400
now we don't need to care about anything anymore because AI will either kill us or save us.

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.520
But I suspect that if humanity continues, it will be due to AI.

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:26.400
What's the timeline for things to get real weird with AI?

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:30.000
And it can get weird in interesting ways before you get to AGI.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.040
What about AI girlfriends and boyfriends? Fundamentally transforming human relationships?

02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:40.240
I think human relationships are already fundamentally transformed, and it's already very weird.

02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:42.640
By which technology?

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:43.600
For instance, social media.

02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:44.100
Yeah.

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:52.400
Yeah. Isn't the fundamentals of the core group of humans that affect your life still the same?

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:54.240
Your loved ones? Family?

02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:59.040
No. I think that, for instance, many people live in intentional communities right now.

02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.920
They're moving around until they find people that they can relate to and they become their family.

02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:09.120
And often that doesn't work, because it turns out that instead of having grown networks where

02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:15.200
you get around with the people that you grew up with, you have more transactional relationships,

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:19.920
you shop around, you have markets for attention and pleasure and relationships.

02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:25.520
That kills the magic somehow. Why is that? Why is the transactional search

02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:33.040
for optimizing allocation of attention somehow misses the romantic magic of what human relations

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:36.960
are? It's all the question, how magical was it before? Was it that you just could rely

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:41.040
on instincts that used your intuitions and you didn't need to rationally reflect?

02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:45.920
But once you understand, it's no longer magical because you actually understand

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.800
why you were attracted to this person at this age and not to that person at this age and what the

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:56.160
actual considerations were that went on in your mind and what the calculations were. What's the

02:29:56.160 --> 02:30:00.160
likelihood that you're going to have a sustainable relationship with this person, that this person is

02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:05.120
not going to leave you for somebody else? How are your life trajectories are going to evolve and so

02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:10.640
on? When you're young, you're unable to explicate all this and you have to rely on intuitions and

02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:15.520
instincts that in part you're born with and also in the wisdom of your environment that is going

02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:21.120
to give you some kind of reflection on your choices. Many of these things are disappearing now

02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:26.720
because we feel that our parents might have no idea about how we are living and the environments

02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:32.000
that we grew up in, the cultures that we grew up in, the values that our parents existed in

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.440
might have no ability to teach us how to deal with this new world.

02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:40.800
For many people, that's actually true, but it doesn't mean that within one generation

02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:44.480
we build something that is more magical and more sustainable and more beautiful.

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:51.520
Instead, we often end up with an attempt to produce something that looks beautiful. I was

02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:59.040
very weirded out by the aesthetics of the Vision Pro asset by Apple and not so much because I don't

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:03.840
like the technology. I'm very curious about what it's going to be like and I don't have an opinion

02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:10.480
yet. But the aesthetics of the presentation and so on were so uncanny valley-esque to me.

02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:21.840
The characters being extremely plastic, living in some hypothetical mid-century furniture museum.

02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:28.160
Yeah. This is the proliferation of marketing teams.

02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:33.120
Yes, but it was a CGI-generated world. It was a CGI-generated world that doesn't exist.

02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:37.120
When I complained about this, some friends came back to me and said,

02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:42.640
but these are startup founders. This is what they live like in Silicon Valley. I tried to

02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:46.800
tell them, no, I know lots of people in Silicon Valley. This is not what people are like. They're

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:55.760
still people. They're still human beings. The grounding in physical reality somehow

02:31:55.840 --> 02:32:02.000
is important too. In culture. What's absent in this thing is culture. There is a simulation

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:09.360
of culture, an attempt to replace culture by catalog, by some kind of aesthetic optimization

02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:14.320
that is not the result of having a sustainable life, a sustainable human relationships with

02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:22.160
houses that work for you and a mode of living that works for you in which these glasses fit

02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:26.560
in naturally. I guess that's also why so many people are veered out about the product because

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:31.040
they don't know how is this actually going to fit into my life and into my human relationships

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:35.680
because the way in which it was presented in these videos didn't seem to be credible.

02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:43.600
Do you think AI, when it's deployed by companies like Microsoft and Google and Meta,

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:51.120
will have the same issue of being weirdly corporate? There'd be some uncanny valley,

02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:55.840
some weirdness to the whole presentation. I've gotten a chance to talk to George Hotz. He

02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:01.200
believes everything should be open source and decentralized and there then we shall have the

02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:10.000
AI of the people and it'll maintain a grounding to the magic that's humanity, that's the human

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:16.880
condition, that corporations will destroy the magic. I believe that if we make everything

02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:24.000
open source and make this mandatory, we are going to lose a lot of beautiful art and a lot

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:32.080
of beautiful designs. There is a reason why Linux desktop is still ugly. It's difficult to

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:39.600
create coherence in the open source designs so far when the designs have to get very large and

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:44.640
it's easier to make this happening in a company with centralized organization.

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:50.880
And from my own perspective, what we should ensure is that open source never dies,

02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:56.880
that it can always compete and has a place with the other forms of organization because I think

02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:02.720
it is absolutely vital that open source exists and that we have systems that people have under

02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:08.640
control outside of the corporation and that is also producing viable competition to the corporations.

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:16.240
So the corporations, the centralized control, the dictatorships of corporations can create beauty.

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.200
Centralized design is a source of a lot of beauty and then I guess open source is a

02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:31.760
source of freedom, a hedge against the corrupting nature of power that comes with centralized.

02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:37.040
I grew up in socialism and I learned that corporations are totally evil and I found

02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:42.640
this very, very convincing. And then you look at corporations like Enron and Halliburton maybe and

02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.840
realize, yeah, they are evil. But you also notice that many other corporations are not evil. They're

02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:53.120
surprisingly benevolent. Why are they so benevolent? Is this because everybody is fighting them all the

02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:58.000
time? I don't think that's the only explanation. It's because they're actually animals that live

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.880
in a large ecosystem and that are still largely controlled by people that want that ecosystem to

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:09.440
flourish and be viable for people. So I think that Pat Gelsinger is completely sincere when

02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:16.720
he leads Intel to be a tool that supplies the free world with semiconductors. And it's not

02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:21.600
necessary that all the semiconductors are coming from Intel. Intel needs to be there to make sure

02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:27.440
that we always have them. So there can be many ways in which we can import and trade semiconductors

02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:31.840
from other companies and places. We just need to make sure that nobody can cut us off from it

02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:38.080
because that would be a disaster for this kind of society and world. And so there are many things

02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:44.640
that need to be done to make our style of life possible. And then with this, I don't mean just

02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:51.120
capitalism, environmental destruction, consumerism, and creature comforts. I mean an idea of life in

02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:57.840
which we are determined not by some kind of king or dictator, but in which individuals can determine

02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:02.720
themselves to the largest possible degree. And to me, this is something that this Western world is

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:08.480
still trying to embody. And it's a very valuable idea that we shouldn't give up too early. And

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:15.440
from this perspective, the US is a system of interleaving clubs. And an entrepreneur is a

02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:21.440
special club founder. It's somebody who makes a club that is producing things that are economically

02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:26.640
viable. And to do this, it requires a lot of people who are dedicating a significant part of their life

02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:32.080
for working for this particular kind of club. And the entrepreneur is picking the initial set of

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:35.920
rules and the mission and vision and aesthetics for the club and make sure that it works.

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.600
But the people that are in there need to be protected. If they sacrifice part of their life,

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:46.880
there need to be rules to tell how they're being taken care of even after they leave the club and

02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:52.880
so on. So there's a large body of rules that have been created by our rule-giving clubs

02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:57.520
and that are enforced by our enforcement clubs and so on. And some of these clubs have to be

02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:02.560
monopolies for game theoretic reasons, which also makes them more open to corruption and less harder

02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:08.160
to update. And this is an ongoing discussion and process that takes place. But the beauty of this

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:14.800
idea that there is no centralized king that is extracting from the peasants and breeding the

02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:21.920
peasants into serving the king and fulfilling all the roles like ants in an antel. But that there is

02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:27.120
a freedom of association and corporations are one of them is something that took me some time to

02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:33.760
realize. So I do think that corporations are dangerous. They need to be protections against

02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:40.800
overreach of corporations that can do regulatory capture and prevent open source from competing

02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:47.760
with corporations by imposing rules that make it impossible for a small group of kids to come

02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:52.720
together to build their own language model because OpenAI has convinced the US that you need to have

02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:57.200
some kind of FDA process that you need to go through that costs many million dollars before

02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:02.560
you are able to train a language model. So this is important to make sure that this doesn't happen.

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:09.200
So I think that OpenAI and Google are good things. If these good things are kept in check in such a

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:14.000
way that all the other clubs can still be founded and all the other forms of clubs that are desirable

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:20.800
can still coexist with them. So what do you think about Meta in contrast to that open sourcing most

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:26.720
of its language models and most of the AI models that's working on and actually suggesting that

02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:32.320
they will continue to do so in the future for future versions of llama for example their large

02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:40.640
language model. What is that exciting to you? Is that concerning? I don't find it very concerning

02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:45.840
but that's also because I think that the language models are not very dangerous yet.

02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:53.600
And yet. Yes. So as I said, I have no proof that there is the boundary between the language models

02:38:53.600 --> 02:39:02.240
and AI, AGI. It's possible that somebody builds a version of baby AGI I think and suppose in

02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:07.440
algorithmic improvements that scale these systems up in ways that otherwise wouldn't have happened

02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.920
without these language model components. So it's not really clear for me what the end

02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:17.360
at the end game is there and if these models can brute force their way into AGI.

02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:23.680
And there's also a possibility that the AGI that we are building with these language models

02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:28.960
are not taking responsibility for what they are because they don't understand the greater game.

02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:36.480
And so to me it would be interesting to try to understand how to build systems that understand

02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:40.400
what the greater games are. What are the longest games that we can play on this planet?

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:46.160
Games broadly like deeply define the way you did with the games.

02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:50.320
In the games the erratic sense. So when we are interacting with each other, in some sense we

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:54.160
are playing games. We are making lots and lots of interactions. This doesn't mean that these

02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:59.440
interactions have all to be transactional. Every one of us is playing some kind of game by

02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:04.480
virtue of identifying these particular kinds of goals that we have or aesthetics

02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:10.800
from which we derive the goals. So when you say I'm Lex Friedman, I'm doing a set of podcasts,

02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:15.760
then you feel that it's part of something larger that you want to build. Maybe you want to inspire

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:20.560
people. Maybe you want them to see more possibilities and get them together over shared ideas.

02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:24.880
Maybe your game is that you want to become super rich and famous by being the best

02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:29.200
post-caster on earth. Maybe you have other games. Maybe it switches from time to time.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.600
But there is a certain perspective where you might be thinking what is the longest possible

02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:38.240
game that you could be playing? A short game is, for instance, cancer is playing a shorter game

02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:44.160
than your organism. Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism. Because

02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:50.720
the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism, except for some infectious cancers like the ones

02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:57.920
that eradicated the Tasmanian devils, you typically end up with a situation where the organism dies

02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:02.480
together with the cancer because the cancer has destroyed the larger system due to playing a

02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:09.200
shorter game. Ideally, you want to, I think, build agents that play the longest possible games.

02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.920
The longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible while doing interesting

02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:22.880
stuff. Yes, that part. The longest possible game while doing interesting stuff and while

02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:27.440
maintaining at least the same amount of interesting complexity, so propagating.

02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:34.400
Currently, I'm pretty much identified as a conscious being. It's the minimal identification

02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:40.080
that I managed to get together because if I turn this off, I fall asleep. And when I'm asleep,

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:45.760
I'm a vegetable. I'm no longer here as an agent. So my agency is basically predicated on being

02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:52.320
conscious. And what I care about is other conscious agents. They're the only moral agents for me.

02:41:53.200 --> 02:42:02.320
And so if an AI were to treat me as a moral agent, that it is interested in coexisting

02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:07.520
with and cooperating with and mutually supporting each other, maybe it is, I think, necessary that

02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:13.840
the AI thinks that consciousness is a viable mode of existence and important. So I think it would be

02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:21.120
very important to build conscious AI and do this as the primary goal. So not just say we want to

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:25.520
build a useful tool that we can use for all sorts of things. And then you have to make sure that the

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.960
impact on the labor market is something that is not too disruptive and manageable and the

02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:34.560
impact on the copyright holder is manageable and not too disruptive and so on.

02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:41.280
I don't think that's the most important game to be played. I think that we will see extremely

02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:47.760
large disruptions of the status quo that are quite unpredictable at this point. And I just

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:53.120
personally want to make sure that some of the stuff on the other side is interesting and conscious.

02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:58.080
How do we ride as individuals and as a society this wave,

02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.960
disruptive wave that changes the nature of the game?

02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:04.640
I absolutely don't know. So everybody is going to do their best, as always.

02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:12.000
Do we build a bunker in the woods? Do we meditate more? Drugs? So mushrooms, psychedelics? I mean,

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:17.680
what? Lots of sex. What are we talking about here? Do you play Diablo 4? I'm

02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:25.440
hoping that will help me escape for a brief moment. Do you play video games? Do you have ideas?

02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:31.520
I really like playing Disco Elysium. It was one of the most beautiful

02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:39.600
computer games I played in recent years. And it's a noir novel that is a philosophical

02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:46.000
perspective on Western society from the perspective of an Estonian. And he first of all wrote a book

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:53.600
about this world that is a parallel universe that is quite poetic and fascinating and

02:43:54.160 --> 02:44:00.400
is condensing his perspective on our societies. It was very, very nice. He spent a lot of time

02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:05.520
writing it. He had, I think, sold a couple thousand books and as a result became an alcoholic.

02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:10.800
And then he had the idea or one of his friends had the idea of turning this into an RPG.

02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:17.680
And it's mind-blowing. They spent the illustrator more than a year just on making

02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:27.360
the art for the scenes in between. It's stunning. But it's a philosophical

02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:31.120
book of art. It's a reflection of society. It's fascinating to spend time in this world.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:39.280
So for me, it was using a medium in a new way and telling a story that left me enriched.

02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:47.440
When I tried Diablo, I didn't feel enriched playing it. I felt that the time playing it was

02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:52.000
not unpleasant, but there's also more pleasant stuff that I can do in that time. So ultimately,

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.160
I feel that I'm being gamed. I'm not gaming. Oh, the addiction thing.

02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:00.080
Yes. I basically feel that there is a very transparent economy that's going on.

02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:05.120
The story of Diablo was brain-dead, so it's not really interesting to me.

02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:09.360
My heart is slowly breaking by the deep truth you're conveying to me.

02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:12.960
Why can't you just allow me to enjoy my personal addiction?

02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:21.040
Go ahead, by all means. Go nuts. I have no objection here. I'm just trying to describe

02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:26.640
what's happening and it's not that I don't do things that I later say, oh, I wish I would

02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:31.200
have done something different. I also know that when we die, the greatest regret that people

02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:35.200
typically have on their desk is to say, oh, I wish I had spent more time on Twitter.

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:41.200
No, I don't think that's the case. I think I would probably have spent less time on Twitter,

02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:46.640
but I found it so useful for myself and also so addictive that I felt I need to make the

02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.600
best of it and turn it into an art form and thought form. It did help me to develop something,

02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:55.760
but I wish what other things I could have done in the meantime,

02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:59.600
it's just not the universe that we're in anymore. Most people don't read books anymore.

02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:06.320
What do you think that means that we don't read books anymore?

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:09.760
What do you think that means about the collective intelligence of our species?

02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:12.400
Is it possible it's still progressing and growing?

02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:16.480
Well, it really is. There is stuff happening on Twitter that was impossible with books,

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:22.800
and I really regret that Twitter has not taken the turn that I was hoping for. I thought Elon

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:28.000
is global brain-pilled and understands that this thing needs to self-organize and he needs to

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:34.080
develop tools to allow the profligation of the self-organization so Twitter can become sentient,

02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:40.000
and maybe this was a pipe dream from the beginning, but I felt that the enormous

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:45.520
pressure that he was under made it impossible for him to work on any kind of content goals.

02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:52.160
Also, many of the decisions that he made under this pressure seem to be not very wise. I don't

02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:56.880
think that as a CEO of a social media company, you should have opinions in the culture of our

02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:04.320
in public. I think that's very short-sighted, and I also suspect that it's not a good idea to

02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:15.360
block Paul Graham, of all people, over setting a mastodon link. I think Paul made this

02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:20.560
intentionally because he wanted to show Elon Musk that blocking people for setting a link

02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:25.600
is completely counter to any idea of free speech that he intended to bring to Twitter.

02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:31.120
And basically, seeing that Elon was very less principled in his thinking there and

02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:39.360
is much more experimental. And many of the things that he is trying, they pan out very differently

02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:44.320
in a digital society than they pan out in a car company because the effect is very different

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:47.920
because everything that you do in a digital society is going to have real world cultural

02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:55.920
effects. And so basically, I find it quite regrettable that this guy is able to become

02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:59.920
de facto the Pope, where Twitter has more active members than the Catholic Church,

02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:07.760
and he doesn't get it. The power and responsibility that he has and the ability to create something

02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:12.640
in this society that is lasting and that is producing a digital agora in a way that has

02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:17.200
never existed before, where we build a social network on top of a social network, an actual

02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:23.760
society on top of the algorithms. So this is something that is hope still in the future and

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:29.920
still in the cards, but it's something that exists in small parts. I find that the corner of Twitter

02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:34.240
that I'm in is extremely pleasant. Just when I take a few steps outside of it, it is not very

02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.800
wholesome anymore. And the way in which people interact with strangers suggests that it's not

02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:45.200
a civilized society yet. So as the number of people who follow you on Twitter expands,

02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:52.880
you feel the burden of the uglier sides of humanity. Yes, but there's also a similar

02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:58.720
thing in the normal world. That is, if you become more influential, if you have more status,

02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:06.800
if you have more fame in the real world, you get lots of perks, but you also have way less freedom

02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:12.480
in the way in which you interact with people, especially with strangers, because a certain

02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:20.560
percentage of people, it's a small single digit percentage, is nuts and dangerous. And the more

02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:27.520
of those are looking at you, the more of them might get ideas. But what if the technology enables you

02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:33.440
to discover the majority of people to discover and connect efficiently and regularly with the

02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:40.000
majority of people who are actually really good? I mean, one of my sort of concerns with a platform

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.320
like Twitter is there's a lot of really smart people out there, a lot of smart people that

02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:50.400
disagree with me and with others between each other. And I love that if the technology would

02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:56.880
bring those to the top, the beautiful disagreements, like intelligence squared type of debates,

02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:01.760
there's a bunch of, I mean, one of my favorite things to listen to is arguments and arguments

02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:06.800
like high effort arguments with respect and love underneath it. But then it gets a little too heated.

02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:12.960
But that kind of too heated, which I've seen you participate in. And I love that with Lee Kroener,

02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:18.880
with those kinds of folks, and you go pretty hard. Like you'll get frustrated, but it's all beautiful.

02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:25.680
Obviously, I can do this because we know each other. And Lee has the rare gift of being willing

02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:30.560
to be wrong in public. So basically he has thoughts that are as wrong as the random thoughts

02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:35.840
of an average, highly intelligent person, but he blurs them out while not being sure if they're

02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:41.760
right. And he enjoys doing that. And once you understand that this is his game, you don't get

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:47.840
offended by him saying something that you think is so wrong. But he's constantly passively communicating

02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:54.000
a respect for the people he's talking with and for just basic humanity and truth and all that kind of

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:59.360
stuff. And there's a self-deprecating thing. There's a bunch of like social skills you acquire

02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:06.720
that allow you to be a great debater, a great argumenter, like be wrong in public and explore

02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:13.360
ideas together in public when you disagree. And I would love for Twitter to elevate those folks,

02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:17.120
elevate those kinds of conversations. It already does in some sense. But

02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:24.560
also if it elevates them too much, then you get this phenomenon on Clubhouse where you always get

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:30.560
dragged on stage. And I found this very stressful because it was too intense. I don't like to be

02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:37.200
dragged on stage all the time. I think once a week is enough. And also when I met Lee the first time,

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:43.760
I found that a lot of people seemed to be shocked by the fact that he was being very aggressive as

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:49.920
their results, that he didn't seem to show a lot of sensibility in the way in which he was criticizing

02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:54.960
what they were doing and being dismissive of the work of others. And that was not, I think,

02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:59.840
in any way a shortcoming of him because I noticed that he was much, much more dismissive with respect

02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:05.840
to his own work. It was his general stance. And I felt that this general stance is creating a lot

02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:11.920
of liability for him because really a lot of people take offense at him being not like their

02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:17.840
Carnegie character who's always smooth and make sure that everybody likes him. So I really respect

02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:23.760
that he is willing to take that risk and to be wrong in public and to offend people.

02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:27.760
And he doesn't do this in any bad way. It's just most people feel, or not all people,

02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:33.760
recognize this. And so I can be much more aggressive with him than I can be with many

02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:38.640
other people who don't play the same game because he understands the way and the spirit in which I

02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:43.440
respond to him. I think that's a fun and that's a beautiful game. It's ultimately a productive one.

02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:47.600
And speaking of taking that risk, you tweeted,

02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:54.480
when you have the choice between being a creator, consumer, or redistributor, always go for creation.

02:52:55.760 --> 02:53:00.800
Not only does it lead to a more beautiful world, but also to a much more satisfying life for

02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:05.840
yourself. And don't get stuck preparing yourself for the journey. The time is always now.

02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:11.760
So let me ask for advice. What advice would you give on how to become such a creator?

02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:20.480
On Twitter, in your own life? I was very lucky to be alive at the time of the collapse of Eastern

02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:26.320
Germany and the transition into Western Germany. And me and my friends and most of the people I

02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:32.320
knew were East Germans. And we were very poor because we didn't have money. And all the capital

02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:36.640
was invested in Germany and they bought our factories and shut them down because they were

02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:44.080
mostly only interested in the market rather than creating new production capacity. And so cities

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:51.120
were poor and in disrepair and we could not afford things. And I could not afford to go into a

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:57.920
restaurant and order a meal there. I would have to cook at home. But I also thought, why not just

02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:03.280
have a restaurant with my friends? So we would open up a cafe with friends and a restaurant and

02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:07.600
we would cook for each other in these restaurants and also invite the general public and they could

02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:14.640
donate. And eventually this became so big that we could turn this into some incorporated form and

02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:19.360
it became a regular restaurant at some point. Or if we did the same thing with a movie theater,

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:26.320
we would not be able to afford to pay 12 marks to watch a movie. But why not just create our

02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:33.440
own movie theater and then invite people to pay and we would rent the movies in a way in which

02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:38.960
a movie theater does. But it would be a community movie theater in which everybody who wants to

02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:44.800
help can watch for free and builds this thing and renovates the building. And so we ended up creating

02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:50.160
lots and lots of infrastructure. And I think when you are young and you don't have money,

02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:54.560
move to a place where this is still happening. Move to one of those places that are undeveloped

02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:58.720
and where you get a critical mass of other people who are starting to build infrastructure

02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:03.040
to live in. And that's super satisfying because you're not just creating infrastructure, but you're

02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:09.120
creating a small society that is building culture and ways to interact with each other. And that's

02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:16.720
much, much more satisfying than going into some kind of chain and get your needs met by ordering

02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:21.120
food from this chain and so on. So not just consuming culture, but creating culture.

02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:25.680
And you don't always have that choice. That's why I prefaced it when you do have the choice.

02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:29.120
And there are many roles that need to be played. We need people who take care of

02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:33.520
our distribution in society and so on. But when you have the choice to create something,

02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:39.280
always go for creation. It's so much more satisfying. And this is what life is about, I think.

02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:47.520
Speaking of which, you retweeted this meme of a life of a philosopher in a nutshell.

02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:53.760
It's birth and death and in between. It's a chubby guy and it says, why though?

02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:58.960
What do you think is the answer to that?

02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:07.280
Well, the answer is that everything that can exist might exist. And in many ways,

02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:12.800
you take an ecological perspective, the same way as when you look at human opinions and cultures.

02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.680
It's not that there is right and wrong opinions when you look at this from this ecological

02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:22.960
perspective. But every opinion that fits between two human ears might be between two human ears.

02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:29.680
And so when I see a strange opinion on social media, it's not that I feel that I have a need

02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:35.680
to get upset. It's often more that I, oh, there you are. And when an opinion is incentivized,

02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:40.960
then it's going to be abundant. And when you take this ecological perspective also on yourself and

02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:45.360
you realize you're just one of these mushrooms that are popping up and doing this thing. And you

02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:51.120
can, depending on where you chose to grow and where you happen to grow, you can flourish or not

02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.520
doing this or that strategy. And it's still all the same life at some level. It's all the

02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:00.640
same experience of being a conscious being in the world. And you do have some choice about

02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:07.200
who you want to be more than any other animal has. That to me is fascinating. And so I think that

02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:14.240
rather than asking yourself what is the one way to think about what are the possibilities that I

02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:18.480
have, what would be the most interesting way to be that I can be. Because everything is possible.

02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:22.800
So you get to explore that. Not everything is possible. Many things fail. Most things fail.

02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:29.680
But often there are possibilities that we are not seeing, especially if we choose who we are.

02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:33.760
To the degree we can choose.

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:44.400
Yasha, you're one of my favorite humans in this world. Consciousness is to merge with for a brief

02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:51.040
moment of time. It's always an honor. It always blows my mind. It will take me days if not weeks

02:57:51.040 --> 02:58:00.480
to recover. And I already miss our chats. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for speaking with me

02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:05.680
so many times. Thank you so much for all the ideas you put out into the world.

02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:12.240
And I'm a huge fan of following you now in this interesting, weird time we're going through with

02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:18.000
AI. So thank you again for talking today. Thank you, Lex, for this conversation. I enjoyed it

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:23.120
very much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yasha Bach. To support this podcast,

02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:28.400
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:34.560
the psychologist Carl Jung. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,
