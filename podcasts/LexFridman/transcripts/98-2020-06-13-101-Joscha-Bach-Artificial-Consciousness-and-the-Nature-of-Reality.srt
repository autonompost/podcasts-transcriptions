00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, VP of Research at the AI Foundation

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,160
with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard. Yosha is one of the most unique

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,080
and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community, exploring the workings of human mind,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,560
intelligence, consciousness, life on Earth, and the possibly simulated fabric of our universe.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,640
I could see myself talking to Yosha many times in the future.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,400
I challenge you to try to figure out how to spell my last name without using the letter E.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,640
And it will probably be the correct way. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,760
and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.

podcast and to get an extra three months free on a one-year package. I've been using ExpressVPN

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,520
for many years. I love it. I think ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there. They told me to say it,

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,840
but I think it actually happens to be true. It doesn't log your data, it's crazy fast,

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,080
and it's easy to use. Literally, just one big power on button. Again, for obvious reasons,

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,720
it's really important that they don't log your data. It works on Linux and everywhere else,

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,840
too. Shout out to my favorite flavor of Linux, Ubuntu Mate 2004. Once again,

21

free on a one-year package. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,240
App Store. When you get it, use code LexPodcast. Cash App lets you send money to friends,

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,760
buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar. Since Cash App does

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,800
fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,120
scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. Big props to the

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,240
Cash App engineers for taking a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,120
making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,320
So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LexPodcast,

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,320
you get ten dollars. Cash App will also donate ten dollars to FIRST,

31
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,600
an organization that is helping advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,960
world. And now, here's my conversation with Joscha Bach.

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,920
As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany, just as we were talking about off mic,

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,560
to parents who were artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the most unique

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,120
thinkers in the AI world. So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit?

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,880
What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies, or just realizations

37
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,800
that had an impact on you when you were growing up that kind of led to the trajectory, or were the

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,560
key sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development?

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,200
My father came from a long tradition of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family,

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,960
and so basically he was technically a nerd. And nerds need to interface in society with

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,480
non-standard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of

42
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,120
communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And normal people understand that the

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,720
primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict,

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large.

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,720
Who is the reviewer in the nerd's view of communication?

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Everybody who you consider to be a peer. So whatever hapless individual is around,

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,920
you would try to make him or her the gift of information.

48
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,680
Now, by the way, my research mal-informed me. So you're an architect or artist?

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,240
He did study architecture, but basically my grandfather made the wrong decision.

50
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,120
He married an aristocrat and was drawn into the war. And he came back after 15 years. So basically

51
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,320
my father was not parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him what to do

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,040
and expected him to do what he was told. And he was unable to. He's unable to do things if he's

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,640
not intrinsically motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son and her son responded

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,120
when he became an architect to become an artist. So he built 100-wasser architecture. He built

55
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,920
houses without right angles. He built lots of things that didn't work in the more brutalist

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,000
traditions of Eastern Germany. And so he bought an old watermill, moved out of the countryside,

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
and did only what he wanted to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for Bohemia because

58
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,400
you had complete material safety, was heavily subsidized, healthcare was free,

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
you didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything.

60
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
So it's a socialized communist side of Germany.

61
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,760
And the other thing is it was almost impossible not to be in political disagreement with your

62
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,840
government, which is very productive for artists. So everything that you do is intrinsically

63
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
meaningful because it will always touch on the deeper currents of society, of culture,

64
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,440
and be in conflict with it and tension with it. And you will always have to define yourself

65
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,560
with respect to this. So what impact did your father, this

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,040
outside-of-the-box thinker against the government, against the world artists,

67
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,000
he was actually not a thinker. He was somebody who only got self-aware to the degree that he

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,920
needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, he was also late 1960s, and he was in

69
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,360
some sense a hippie. So he became a one-person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. He built

70
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:10,240
big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on, and convinced a woman to live with

71
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,120
him. She was also an architect, and she adored him and decided to share her life with him.

72
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,160
And I basically grew up in a big cave full of books. I'm almost feral. And I was bored out there.

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,400
It was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely. So I started to read. And by the time I

74
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,600
came to school, I've read everything until fourth grade and then some. And there was not a real way

75
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,880
for me to relate to the outside world. And I couldn't quite put my finger on why. And today

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,240
I know it was because I was a nerd, obviously. And I was the only nerd around. So there were no

77
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,560
other kids like me. And there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on.

78
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,480
And this village school that I went to was basically a nice school. Kids were nice to me.

79
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,960
I was not beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or build deep relationships. They only

80
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,120
happened starting from ninth grade when I went into a school for mathematics and physics.

81
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,760
Do you remember any key books from this moment?

82
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,440
Yes. I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the

83
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
children's and young adult sections. And then I read a lot of science fiction. For instance,

84
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,680
Stanislav Lem, basically the great author of cybernetics, has influenced me. Back then,

85
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural

86
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,200
to me. And it's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote. Another thing that

87
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,640
was very influential on me were the classical philosophers and also the teacher of romanticism.

88
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,240
So German poetry and art, Droste-Hilshoff and Heine and up to Hesse and so on.

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,400
Hesse, I love Hesse. So at which point do the classical philosophers end? At this point,

90
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,200
we're in the 21st century. What's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through

91
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
even as far as Nietzsche or is this, are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?

92
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster.

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,160
So he's very smart and easy to read. And yeah, but he's not so much trolling others. He's trolling

94
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,640
himself because he was at odds with the world. Largely his romantic relationships didn't work

95
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,360
out. He got angry and he basically became a nihilist. Isn't that a beautiful way to be

96
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,160
as an intellectual is to constantly be trolling yourself, to be in that conflict, in that,

97
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,800
no, in that tension. I think it's the lack of self-awareness. At some point, you have to

98
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,840
understand the comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not

99
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,160
functional, it ends in tragedy as it did for Nietzsche. I think you think he took himself

100
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,680
too seriously in that tension. And as you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, the Steppenwolf

101
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,720
syndrome is classic adolescent where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't

102
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,520
understand that all the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self-awareness.

103
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,160
Because you think that you are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave

104
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,400
the same way as you expect them based on your innate instincts and it doesn't work out. And

105
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,920
you become a transcendentalist to deal with that. So it's very, very understandable and have great

106
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,720
sympathies for this to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history,

107
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,800
but you have to grow out of it. So as an intellectual, a life well-lived, a journey

108
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
well-traveled is one where you don't take yourself seriously. No, I think that you

109
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,800
neither serious or not serious yourself because you need to become unimportant as a subject. That is,

110
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,720
if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb. You don't do this for the audience,

111
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,120
you don't do it for yourself. You have to submit to the things that are possibly true

112
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,680
and you have to follow wherever your inquiry leads, but it's not about you. It has nothing

113
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,160
to do with you. So do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of in the idea of there's

114
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,680
objective truth. So what's your sense in the philosophical, if you remove yourself,

115
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
that's objective from the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover

116
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,120
ideas that are true or are we just in a mesh of relative concepts that are neither true nor false?

117
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,080
It's just a giant mess. You cannot define objective truth without understanding the

118
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,040
nature of truth in the first place. So what does the brain mean by saying that discover

119
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,280
something as truth? So for instance, a model can be predictive or not predictive.

120
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Then there can be a sense in which a mathematical statement can be true because it's defined as

121
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,160
true under certain conditions. So it's basically a particular state that a variable can have in a

122
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,760
simple game. And then you can have a correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is

123
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,480
again a type of model correspondence. And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground truth.

124
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,920
So for instance, you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all, right?

125
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,920
That's stunning when you realize something exists rather than nothing. And this seems to be true,

126
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,480
right? There's an absolute truth in the fact that something seems to be happening.

127
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,600
Yeah, that to me is a showstopper. I could just think about that idea and be amazed by that idea

128
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,080
for the rest of my life and not go any farther because I don't even know the answer to that.

129
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,440
Why does anything exist at all? Well, the easiest answer is existence

130
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
is the default, right? So this is the lowest number of bits that you would need to encode this.

131
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,560
Whose answer? Who provides it?

132
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
The simplest answer to this is that existence is the default.

133
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,840
What about non-existence? I mean, that seems...

134
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
Non-existence might not be a meaningful notion in this sense. So in some sense,

135
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,080
if everything that can exist exists, for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable.

136
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,880
The only thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the

137
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,760
superposition of all finite automata. And we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties

138
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,960
that it can contain us. What does it mean to be a superposition of finite automata? So any

139
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,480
superposition of all possible rules? Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator

140
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,040
that acts on some substrate. And as a result, you get emergent patterns.

141
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,400
What's the substrate? I have no idea to know.

142
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,760
But some substrate. It's something that can store

143
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,240
information. Something that can store information,

144
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
there's a automaton. Something that can hold state.

145
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,400
Still, it doesn't make sense to me the why that exists at all. I could just sit there with a

146
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,080
beer or a vodka and just enjoy the fact, pondering the why.

147
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,040
May not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there could be

148
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,440
no relation in the why direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't mean that

149
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,440
everything has to have a purpose or cause, right? So we mentioned some philosophers in that early,

150
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,600
just taking a brief step back into that. Okay, so we asked ourselves,

151
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,680
when did classical philosophy end? I think for Germany, it largely ended with the

152
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,040
first revolution. Which one was that? This was when we entered the monarchy

153
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,200
and started a democracy. And at this point, we basically came up with a new form of government

154
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,000
that didn't have a good sense of this new organism that society wanted to be.

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
And in a way, it decapitated the universities. So the universities went on through modernism

156
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,600
like a headless chicken. At the same time, democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism

157
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,800
as a result. And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned down intellectual

158
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,160
traditions in Russia. And Germany, both Germanies have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had

159
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,680
this vulgar dialectic materialism and Western Germany didn't get much more edgy than Habermas.

160
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,640
So in some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions and killing off and

161
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:48,160
driving out the Jews didn't help. Yeah, so that was the end of really rigorous,

162
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,200
what you would say is classical philosophy. There's also this thing that in some sense,

163
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,680
the low-hanging fruits in philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered

164
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,800
was the constructivist turn in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of mathematics

165
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,320
that work are computation, there was a very significant discovery in the first half of the

166
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,720
20th century. And it hasn't fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. So physicists

167
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,360
checked out the code libraries for mathematics before constructivism became universal.

168
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,440
What's constructivism? Are you referring to Gödel's incompleteness theorem?

169
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,640
Gödel himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance,

170
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,200
a country's set theoretic experiments in mathematics led into contradictions. And

171
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,560
he noticed that with the current semantics, we cannot build a computer in mathematics that

172
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,160
runs mathematics without crashing. And Gödel could prove this. And so what Gödel could show

173
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,440
is using classical mathematical semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Gödel strongly

174
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,040
believed in these semantics and more than in what he could observe and so on, he was shocked. It

175
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,200
basically shook his world to the core because in some sense he felt that the world has to be

176
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,720
implemented in classical mathematics. And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that

177
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,080
Turing could see that the solution is to understand that mathematics was computation all along,

178
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,200
which means, for instance, pi in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function,

179
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,320
but it's the same thing. And in computation, a function is only a value when you can compute

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,800
it. And if you cannot compute the last digit of pi, you only have a function. You can plug this

181
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,520
function into your local sun, let it run until the sun burns out. This is it. This is the last digit

182
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,400
of pi you will know. But it also means that there can be no process in the physical universe or in

183
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,320
any physically realized computer that depends on having known the last digit of pi. Which means

184
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,280
there are parts of physics that are defined in such a way that cannot strictly be true because

185
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,520
assuming that this could be true leads into contradictions. So I think putting computation

186
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,760
at the center of the world view is actually the right way to think about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein

187
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,960
could see it. And Wittgenstein basically preempted the logitist program of AI that Minsky started

188
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,960
later, like 30 years later. Turing was actually a pupil of Wittgenstein. Really? I didn't know

189
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,320
there's any connection between Turing and Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein even canceled some

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,000
classes when Turing was not present because he thought it was not worth spending the time with

191
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,880
the others. Oh, interesting. Interesting. And if you read the Tractatus, it's a very beautiful book.

192
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,840
Basically, one thought on 75 pages. It's very non-typical for philosophy because it doesn't have

193
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,160
arguments in it and it doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending

194
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,880
to convince anybody. It says it's mostly for people that had the same insight as me.

195
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,640
Just spell it out. And this insight is there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy

196
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,600
ought to meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those

197
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,120
that are so formalizable that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make.

198
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
But the price that you pay is that your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say

199
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,320
something meaningful in mathematics. And it looks complicated to people, but it's far less

200
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,560
complicated than what our brain is casually doing all the time. And it makes sense of reality.

201
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,640
And philosophy is coming from the top. So it's mostly starting from natural languages with

202
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,360
vaguely defined concepts. And the hope is that mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point.

203
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,760
And Wittgenstein was trying to make them meet. And he already understood that, for instance,

204
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,240
you could express everything with the NAND calculus, that you could reduce the entire logic

205
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,960
to NAND gates as we do in our modern computers. So in some sense, he already understood Turing

206
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,040
universality before Turing spelled it out. I think when he wrote the track titles,

207
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,480
he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important and significant.

208
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,240
And I suspect then when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was not that famous.

209
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,720
When he lived, it was mostly his work in decrypting the German codes that made him famous

210
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,920
or gave him some notoriety. But the saint status that he has to computer science right now in the AI

211
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,840
is something that I think he could acquire later. That's kind of interesting. Do you think of

212
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,800
computation and computer science? And you kind of represent that to me as maybe that's the modern

213
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:19,040
day. You, in a sense, are the new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist who dares to ask

214
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,040
the bigger questions that philosophy originally started. Is the new philosopher? Certainly not

215
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,320
me, I think. I'm mostly still this child that grows up in a very beautiful valley and looks

216
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,080
at the world from the outside and tries to understand what's going on. And my teachers

217
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,480
tell me things and they largely don't make sense. So I have to make my own models. I have to

218
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,120
discover the foundations of what the others are saying. I have to try to fix them to be charitable.

219
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,520
I try to understand what they must have thought originally or what their teachers or their

220
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,280
teachers' teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation and how to

221
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
make sense of the reality that we are in. And whenever I have an original idea, I'm usually

222
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,080
late to the party by, say, 400 years. And the only thing that's good is that the parties get

223
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,920
smaller and smaller the older I get and the more I explore. The parties get smaller? And more

224
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,480
exclusive. And more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing was

225
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,880
that you were not tethered, whether it's because of your parents or in general maybe you're something

226
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,280
within your mind, some genetic material, that you were not tethered to the ideas of the general

227
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,400
populace, which is actually a unique property or kind of the education system and whatever,

228
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,760
not education system, just existing in this world forces certain sets of ideas onto you.

229
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,120
Can you disentangle that? Why are you not so tethered? Even in your work today,

230
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:55,360
you seem to not care about perhaps a best paper in Europe. Being tethered to particular things

231
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,480
that current today in this year people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and resume.

232
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,880
You're a little bit more outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people are

233
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,960
especially focused in, the benchmarks of today, the things. Can you disentangle that? Because I

234
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,360
think that's inspiring. And if there were more people like that, we might be able to solve some

235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,400
of the bigger problems that sort of AI dreams to solve. And there's a big danger in this because

236
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,160
in a way you are expected to marry into an intellectual tradition and visit this tradition

237
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,200
into a particular school. If everybody comes up with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not

238
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,640
cumulative as an enterprise. So in some sense, you need a healthy balance, you need paradigmatic

239
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
thinkers, and you need people that work within given paradigms. Basically, scientists today

240
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,640
define themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a disease that we think as a scientist,

241
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,480
somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor that they should join a particular

242
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
discipline and then they find a good mentor to learn the right methods. And then they are lucky

243
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,000
enough and privileged enough to join the right team. And then their name will show up on influential

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,240
papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns with this approach.

245
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,400
And when our field, computer science and AI started, most of the people that joined this

246
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,080
field had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers in AI either don't have interesting

247
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,920
opinions at all, or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually doing.

248
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Because what they're doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon.

249
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,000
And this is often a good idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for me,

250
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
it's first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it? If the current

251
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,520
methods of machine learning lead to strong AI, why should I be doing it? I will just wait until

252
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,880
they're done and wait until they do this on the beach, or read interesting books or write some

253
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,920
and have fun. But if you don't think that you're currently doing the right thing,

254
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,800
if you are missing some perspectives, then it's required to think outside of the box.

255
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:13,680
It's also required to understand the boxes. But it's necessary to understand what worked

256
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,560
and what didn't work and for what reasons. So you have to be willing to ask new questions

257
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,840
and design new methods whenever you want to answer them. And you have to be willing to dismiss

258
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,600
the existing methods if you think that they're not going to yield the right answers.

259
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,600
It's very bad career advice to do that.

260
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:39,760
So maybe to briefly stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the

261
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,480
dream before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started? When was the dream to

262
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,640
understand or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you?

263
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,920
I think that you can see AI largely today as

264
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,040
advanced information processing. If you would change the acronym of AI into that,

265
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,720
most people in the field would be happy. It would not change anything what they're doing.

266
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,320
We're automating statistics and many of the statistical models are more advanced than what

267
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,760
statisticians had in the past. And it's pretty good work. It's very productive. And the other

268
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,240
aspect of AI is its philosophical project. And this philosophical project is very risky

269
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,480
and very few people work on it. And it's not clear if it succeeds.

270
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,640
First of all, you keep throwing a lot of really interesting ideas and I have to

271
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,120
pick which ones we go with. First of all, you use the term information processing,

272
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:48,960
just information processing, as if it's the muck of existence, as if it's the epitome,

273
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,240
that the entirety of the universe might be information processing, that consciousness,

274
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,440
the intelligence might be information processing. So maybe you can comment on

275
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,760
if the advanced information processing is a limiting kind of realm of ideas. And then the

276
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,880
other one is what do you mean by the philosophical project?

277
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,360
So I suspect that general intelligence is the result of trying to solve general problems.

278
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,240
So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model. It's not necessarily

279
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,920
goal-directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this.

280
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,840
But it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in

281
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,640
those patterns and be able to predict the next set of patterns to make sense of things.

282
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,720
And some problems are very general. Usually intelligence serves control. So you make these

283
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,480
models for a particular purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain

284
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,160
results. But the intelligence itself is in a sense instrumental to something. But by itself,

285
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,480
it's just the ability to make models. And some of the problems are so general that the system

286
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,040
that makes them needs to understand what itself is and how it relates to the environment.

287
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,040
So as a child, for instance, you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving

288
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,880
yourself as wanting different things. So you become aware of your own psychology.

289
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,160
You become aware of the fact that you have complex structure in yourself and you need to

290
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,640
model yourself to reverse engineer yourself to be able to predict how you will react to

291
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
certain situations and how you deal with yourself in relationship to your environment.

292
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,080
And this project, if you reverse engineer yourself in your relationship to reality

293
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,360
and the nature of a universe that can continue, if you go all the way, this is basically the

294
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,920
project of AI or you could say the project of AI is a very important component in it.

295
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,400
The true Turing test in a way is you ask a system what is intelligence. If that system is able to

296
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,440
explain what it is, how it works, then you should assign it the property of being intelligent in

297
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,560
this general sense. So the test that Turing was administering in a way, I don't think that

298
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,360
he couldn't see it, but he didn't express it yet in the original 1950 paper, is that

299
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,800
he was trying to find out whether he was generally intelligent. Because in order to take this test,

300
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,480
the rap is, of course, you need to be able to understand what the system is saying.

301
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,880
And we don't yet know if we can build an AI. We don't yet know if we are generally intelligent.

302
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
Basically, you win the Turing test by building an AI.

303
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,760
Yes. So in a sense, hidden within the Turing test is a kind of recursive test.

304
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,720
Yes. It's a test on us. The Turing test is basically a test of the conjecture whether

305
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,600
people are intelligent enough to understand themselves.

306
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,520
Okay. But you also mentioned a little bit of a self-awareness. And in the project of AI,

307
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,920
do you think this kind of emergent self-awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence?

308
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,960
So as opposed to goal oriented, as you said, kind of puzzle solving, is coming to

309
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,200
grips with the idea that you're an agent in the world?

310
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,800
I find that many highly intelligent people are not very self-aware.

311
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,120
So self-awareness and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be self-aware if

312
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
you have good priors, especially, without being especially intelligent. So you don't need to be

313
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,720
very good at solving puzzles if the system that you are already implements the solution.

314
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,600
But I do find intelligence. So you kind of mentioned children, right?

315
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,840
Is that the fundamental project of AI, is to create the learning system that's able to

316
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,920
exist in the world? So you kind of drew a difference between self-awareness

317
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,440
and intelligence. And yet you said that the self-awareness seems to be important for children.

318
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,480
So I call this ability to make sense of the world and your own place and so to make you able to

319
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,720
understand what you're doing in this world, sentience. And I would distinguish sentience

320
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,440
from intelligence because sentience is possessing certain classes of models.

321
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,600
And intelligence is a way to get to these models if you don't already have them.

322
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:10,560
I see. So can you maybe pause a bit and try to answer the question that we just said we

323
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,080
may not be able to answer? And it might be a recursive meta question of what is intelligence?

324
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,600
I think that intelligence is the ability to make models.

325
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,640
So models. I think it's useful as examples, very popular now, neural networks form representations

326
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,920
of large scale data set. They form models of those data sets. When you say models

327
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,400
and look at today's neural networks, what are the difference of how you're thinking about

328
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,440
what is intelligent in saying that intelligence is the process of making models?

329
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,680
Two aspects to this question. One is the representation. Is the representation adequate

330
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,920
for the domain that we want to represent? And the other one is the type of the model that you arrive

331
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,240
at adequate. So basically, are you modeling the correct domain? And I think in both of these

332
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,680
cases, modern AI is lacking still. And I think that I'm not saying anything new here. I'm not

333
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:18,000
criticizing the field. Most of the people that design our paradigms are aware of that.

334
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And so one aspect that we're missing is unified learning. When we learn, we at some point discover

335
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,840
that everything that we sense is part of the same object, which means we learn it all into one model

336
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,680
and we call this model the universe. So the experience of the world that we are embedded on

337
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,120
is not a secret direct wire to physical reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we

338
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,480
can never experience or get access to. But it has these properties that it can create certain

339
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,720
patterns at our systemic interface to the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the

340
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,440
relationship between the patterns that we discover is what we call the physical universe. So at some

341
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,560
point in our development as a nervous system, we discover that everything that we relate to

342
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,440
in the world can be mapped to a region in the same three-dimensional space, by and large. We now know

343
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,000
in physics that this is not quite true. The world is not actually three-dimensional, but the world

344
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,960
that we are entangled with at the level which we are entangled with is largely a flat three-dimensional

345
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,040
space. And so this is the model that our brain is intuitively making. And this is, I think, what

346
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,240
gave rise to this intuition of res extensa of this material world, this material domain. It's one of

347
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,280
the mental domains, but it's just the class of all models that relate to this environment, this

348
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,760
three-dimensional physics engine in which we are embedded. Physics engine in which we're embedded.

349
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:48,960
I love that. Just slowly pause. So the quantum graph, I think you called it, which is the real

350
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,760
world, which you can never get access to, there's a bunch of questions I want to sort of disentangle

351
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,920
that. But maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at, can you just describe the

352
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:06,480
basics? Can you talk about what is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism? What is functionalism

353
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,960
and what connects with you most? Because you just mentioned there's a reality we don't have access

354
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,720
to. What does that even mean? And why don't we get access to it? Aren't we part of that reality? Why

355
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,640
can't we access it? So the particular trajectory that mostly exists in the West is the result of

356
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,320
our indoctrination by a cult for 2000 years. A cult, which one?

357
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes, the Catholic cult mostly. And for better or worse, it has created or defined many of the

358
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,000
modes of interaction that we have that has created this society, but it has also in some sense

359
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:49,120
scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists, if you would translate the mythology of

360
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,240
the Catholic church into the modern world is that the world in which you and me interact

361
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,520
is something like a multiplayer role-playing adventure. And the money and the objects that

362
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:05,840
we have in this world, this is all not real. Or as Eastern philosophers would say, it's Maya. It's

363
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,160
just stuff that appears to be meaningful and this embedding in this meaning, if you believe in it,

364
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,320
it's samsara. It's basically the identification with the needs of the mundane secular everyday

365
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,720
existence. And the Catholics also introduced the notion of higher meaning, the sacred.

366
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,800
And this existed before, but eventually the natural shape of God is the platonic form of

367
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,160
the civilization that you are part of. It's basically the superorganism that is formed

368
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,880
by the individuals as an intentional agent. And basically, the Catholics used a relatively crude

369
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,000
mythology to implement software on the minds of people and get the software synchronized to make

370
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,120
them walk on lockstep to basically get this God online and to make it efficient and effective.

371
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,040
And I think God technically is just a self that spans multiple brains as opposed to your and

372
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,640
myself, which mostly exists just on one brain. And so in some sense, you can construct a self

373
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,320
functionally as a function that is implemented by brains that exists across brains. And this is a

374
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:20,240
God with a small g. This is one of the nice features of our brains. It seems that we can

375
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,320
all download the same piece of software like God in this case and share it.

376
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,920
You give everybody a spec and the mathematical constraints that are intrinsic to information

377
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,560
processing make sure that given the same spec, you come up with a compatible structure.

378
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,680
Okay. So there's the space of ideas that we all share. And we think that's kind of the mind,

379
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,160
but that's separate from the idea is from Christianity, from religion is that there's

380
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,880
a separate thing between the mind. There is a real world. And this real world is the world

381
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,440
in which God exists. God is the coder of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And

382
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,920
we are all players in this game. And that's dualism.

383
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,320
But the dualism aspect is because the mental realm exists in a different implementation

384
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,840
than the physical realm. And the mental realm is real. And a lot of people have this intuition

385
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,520
that there is this real room in which you and me talk and speak right now. Then comes a layer of

386
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,720
physics and abstract rules and so on. And then comes another real room where our souls are.

387
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,960
And our true form isn't a thing that gives us phenomenal experience. And this is, of course,

388
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,440
a very confused notion that you would get. And basically, it's the result of connecting

389
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,000
materialism and idealism in the wrong way. Okay. I apologize, but I think it's really

390
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,920
helpful if we just tried to define terms. What is dualism? What is idealism? What is

391
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,160
materialism for people who don't know? So the idea of dualism in our cultural

392
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,040
tradition is that there are two substances, a mental substance and a physical substance.

393
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,280
And they interact by different rules. And the physical world is basically causally closed and

394
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
is built on a low-level causal structure. So there's basically a bottom level that is

395
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,720
causally closed that's entirely mechanical. And mechanical in the widest sense. So it's

396
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,880
computational. There's basically a physical world in which information flows around.

397
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,120
And physics describes the laws of how information flows around in this world.

398
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,960
Would you compare it to a computer where you have hardware and software?

399
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
The computer is a generalization of information flowing around. Basically,

400
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,920
but you won't discover that there is a universal principle. You can define this universal machine

401
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,080
that is able to perform all the computations. So all these machines have the same power.

402
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,520
This means that you can always define a translation between them as long as they

403
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,880
have unlimited memory to be able to perform each other's computations.

404
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,440
So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware

405
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,000
and idealism is this whole world is just the software?

406
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,560
Not quite. I think that most idealists don't have a notion of software yet

407
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,120
because software also comes down to information processing.

408
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,360
What you notice is the only thing that is real to you and me is this experiential world in which

409
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,080
things matter, in which things have taste, in which things have color, phenomenal content and so on.

410
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,080
You are bringing up consciousness.

411
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,400
And this is distinct from the physical world in which things have values only in an abstract

412
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:32,160
sense and you only look at cold patterns moving around. So how does anything feel like something?

413
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,760
And this connection between the two things is very puzzling to a lot of people,

414
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,200
and of course, too many philosophers. So idealism starts out with the notion that

415
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,440
mind is primary, materialism thinks that matter is primary. And so for the idealist,

416
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,640
the material patterns that we see playing out are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming.

417
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,880
And we exist in a mind on a higher plane of existence if you want. And for the materialist,

418
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,720
there is only this material thing and that generates some models and we are the result

419
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,800
of these models. And in some sense, I don't think that we should understand,

420
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,560
if you understand it properly, materialism and idealism is a dichotomy, but as two different

421
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,120
aspects of the same thing. So the weird thing is we don't exist in the physical world. We do

422
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,760
exist inside of a story that the brain tells itself.

423
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:33,760
Let my information processing take that in. We don't exist in the physical world. We exist

424
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,160
in the narrative. Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A neuron cannot feel anything.

425
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,320
They're physical things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything, but it would be

426
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,960
very useful for the brain or for the organism to know what it would be like to be a person and to

427
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,880
feel something. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the

428
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,040
interactions of the person. It's the best model of what that brain, this organism,

429
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,280
thinks it is in relationship to its environment. So it creates that model. It's a story,

430
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,480
a multimedia novel that the brain is continuously writing and updating.

431
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:16,240
But you also said that we exist in that story. What is real in any of this? So

432
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,920
there's a, again, these terms are, you kind of said there's a quantum graph. I mean, what is

433
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,320
this whole thing running on then? Is the story, and is it completely, fundamentally impossible

434
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,520
to get access to it? Because isn't the story supposed to, isn't the brain in something,

435
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,080
in existing, in some kind of context? So what we can identify as computer scientists,

436
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:50,480
we can engineer systems and test our theories this way that might have the necessary and

437
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,440
sufficient properties to produce the phenomena that we are observing, which is there is a self

438
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,240
in a virtual world that is generated in somebody's neocortex that is contained in the skull of this

439
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,600
primate here. And when I point at this, this indexicality is of course wrong, but I do create

440
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,600
something that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina that allow you to interpret what

441
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,560
I'm saying. But we both know that the world that you and me are seeing is not the real

442
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,960
physical world. What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your brain

443
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,360
to explain the patterns on your retina. How close is it to the real world? That's kind of the

444
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:35,520
question. Is it, when you have people like Donald Hoffman that say that you're really far away,

445
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,120
the thing we're seeing you and I now, that interface we have is very far away from anything,

446
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,120
we don't even have anything close to the sense of what the real world is,

447
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:51,120
or is it a very surface piece of architecture? Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal,

448
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,520
this famous thing that Bernard Mandelbrot discovered. If you see an overall shape in

449
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,080
there, but if you truly understand it, you know it's two lines of code. It's basically a series

450
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,080
that is being tested for complex numbers in the complex number plane for every point. And for

451
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:18,160
those where the series is diverging, you paint this black. And where it's converging, you don't.

452
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:27,920
And you get the intermediate colors by checking how far it diverges. This gives you this shape

453
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,000
of this fractal. But imagine you live inside of this fractal and you don't have access to

454
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,400
where you are in the fractal, or you have not discovered the generator function even.

455
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,520
So what you see is, all I can see right now is a spiral. And the spiral moves a little bit to

456
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,320
the right. Is this an accurate model of reality? Yes, it is. It is an adequate description.

457
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,920
You know that there is actually no spiral in the Mandelbrot fractal. It only appears like this to

458
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,200
an observer that is interpreting things as a two-dimensional space and then defines certain

459
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,200
regularities in there at a certain scale that it currently observes. Because if you zoom in,

460
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,880
the spiral might disappear and turn out to be something different at a different resolution.

461
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,200
At this level, you have the spiral. And then you discover the spiral moves to the right and

462
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,600
at some point it disappears. So you have a singularity. At this point, your model is no

463
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,080
longer valid. You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity. But you can observe again

464
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,880
and you will see it hit another spiral and at this point it disappeared. So we now have a second

465
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,680
order law. And if you make 30 layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world

466
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,360
that is similar to the one that we come up with when we describe the reality around us.

467
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,080
It's reasonably predictive. It does not cut to the core of it. It does not explain how it's

468
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,200
being generated, how it actually works. But it's relatively good to explain the universe that we

469
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,200
are entangled with. But you don't think the tools of computer science, the tools of physics could

470
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,680
step outside, see the whole drawing and get at the basic mechanism of how the pattern,

471
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,960
the spiral is generated? Imagine you would find yourself embedded into a Mandelbrot fractal and

472
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,960
you try to figure out what works and you somehow have a Turing machine with enough

473
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,840
memory to think. And as a result, you come to this idea, it must be some kind of automaton.

474
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,840
And maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata until you get to the one that produces

475
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,560
your reality. So you can identify necessary and sufficient condition. For instance,

476
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,680
we discovered that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages. And then we see that

477
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,480
most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing the same

478
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,640
fractals. This is what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different domains

479
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,360
to each other. So there are not that many fractals. And some of these have interesting

480
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,320
structures and symmetry breaks. And so you can discover what region of this global fractal you

481
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,240
might be embedded in from first principles. But the only way you can get there is from

482
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,880
first principles. So basically, your understanding of the universe has to start with automata and

483
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,840
then number theory and then spaces and so on. Yeah, I think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams

484
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,400
that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules of the cellular automata or the generalization

485
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,800
of which is behind our universe. You've said on this topic, you said in a recent conversation

486
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,640
that quote, some people think that a simulation can't be conscious and only a physical system can,

487
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,440
but they got it completely backward. A physical system cannot be conscious.

488
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,360
Only a simulation can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property,

489
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:32,800
the simulated self. Just like you said, the mind is kind of the, we'll call it story narrative.

490
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,760
There's a simulation. So our mind is essentially a simulation.

491
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,800
Usually I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically the principles that produce the

492
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,400
simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain. And the mind is creating both the

493
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,640
universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that is on the other side of attention

494
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,680
and is embedded in this world. Why is that important? That idea of a self,

495
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,360
why is that an important feature in the simulation? It's basically a result of the

496
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,600
purpose that the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys.

497
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:16,400
We are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is

498
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,880
the relationship of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of

499
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,040
other organisms. And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to.

500
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,280
These regulation targets start with priors. They're basically like unconditional reflexes

501
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,120
that we are more or less born with. And then we can reverse engineer them to make them more

502
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,360
consistent. And then we get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with

503
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,680
it. And so these priors that you commit to are largely target values that our needs should

504
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,560
approach, set points. And this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension. And we

505
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,200
find ourselves living inside of feedback loops, right? The consciousness emerges over dimensions

506
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,640
of disagreements with the universe, things where you care, things are not the way they should be,

507
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,280
but you need to regulate. And so in some sense, the sense self is the result of all the

508
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,200
identifications that you're having. And identification is a regulation target that

509
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,040
you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about, that you think is important.

510
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,280
And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments of these identifications,

511
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,080
you get free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them,

512
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,640
you're completely free and you can enter nirvana because you're done.

513
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,120
And actually, this is a good time to pause and say thank you to sort of a friend of mine,

514
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,720
Gustav Sortostrom, who introduced me to your work. I wanted to give him a shout out.

515
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,640
He's a brilliant guy. And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing. And Gustav is a good

516
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,360
representative of that. You are as well. So I'm glad, first of all, I'm glad the internet exists

517
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:57,760
and YouTube exists where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study your writing

518
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,240
and think about, you know, that's amazing. Okay. But you've kind of described sort of this

519
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,840
emergent phenomena of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard problem of

520
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:19,760
consciousness? Can you just linger on it? Like, why does it still feel like I understand you're

521
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,680
kind of the self is an important part of the simulation. But why does the simulation feel

522
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,440
like something? So if you look at the book by, say, George R. R. Martin, where the characters

523
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,480
have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below

524
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,160
the hill and they're done in it. And they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive

525
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,800
and feel empowered and all these things. Why do they have these emotions? It's because it's written

526
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,200
into the story, right? And it's written to the story because it's an adequate model of the person

527
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,320
that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing has happened to us. So it's

528
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,680
basically a story that our brain is writing. It's not written in words. It's written in perceptual

529
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,240
content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what the person would feel if it existed.

530
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:12,720
So it's a virtual person. And you and me happen to be this virtual person. So this virtual person

531
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,680
gets access to the language center and talks about the sky being blue. And this is us.

532
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,080
But hold on a second. Do I exist in your simulation?

533
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,760
You do exist in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less

534
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:37,280
accessible for me that you have and so on. And my model might not be completely adequate.

535
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,760
There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense,

536
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,000
both you and me are some puppets, two puppets that enact a play in my mind. And I identify

537
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,640
with one of them because I can control one of the puppets directly. And with the other one,

538
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,320
I can create things in between. So for instance, we can go on an interaction that even leads to

539
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,960
a coupling to a feedback loop. So we can sync things together in a certain way or feel things

540
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,520
together. But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon. It's entirely a software

541
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,600
phenomenon. It's the result of two different implementations interacting with each other.

542
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:19,520
So that's interesting. The way you think about it is the entirety of existence,

543
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:30,720
the simulation and where each mind is a little sub simulation. Why doesn't your mind have access

544
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:39,600
to my mind's full state? For the same reason that my mind doesn't have access to its own full state.

545
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,880
I mean, there is no trick involved. So basically, when I know something about myself,

546
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,280
it's because I made a model. So one part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other parts

547
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,520
of your brain are doing. Yes. But there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world

548
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,360
in the physical sense, that there's repeatable experiments and so on. How does that fit into our

549
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:09,680
silly Descendants of Apes simulation of the world? So why is everything so repeatable?

550
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,720
Not everything. There's a lot of fundamental physics experiments that are repeatable

551
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,760
for a long time, all over the place, and so on. The laws of physics, how does that fit in?

552
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,920
It seems that the parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long lived. So if you build

553
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,560
a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something, you'll notice that

554
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,640
the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics. So basically,

555
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,120
if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result usually of some control,

556
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,360
of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors. And the things that are

557
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,840
not stable, that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on, they tend to get

558
00:50:53,840 --> 00:51:00,640
weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that sustains complexity,

559
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,480
which is required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe that

560
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,920
is very tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of interesting symmetries

561
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:19,520
and also symmetry breaks that allow the creation of structure. But they exist where? So there's

562
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,960
such an interesting idea that our mind is simulation that's constructing the narrative.

563
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:31,920
My question is just to try to understand how that fits with the entirety of the universe.

564
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,160
You're saying that there's a region of this universe that allows enough complexity to create

565
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:43,840
creatures like us, but what's the connection between the brain, the mind, and the broader

566
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,280
universe? Which comes first? Which is more fundamental? Is the mind the starting point

567
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,520
the universe is emergent? Is the universe the starting point the minds are emergent?

568
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:59,120
I think quite clearly the latter. That's at least a much easier explanation because it allows us to

569
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,960
make causal models and I don't see any way to construct an inverse causality. So what happens

570
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,280
when you die to your mind simulation? My implementation ceases. So basically the thing

571
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,080
that implements myself will no longer be present, which means if I am not implemented on the minds

572
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,840
of other people, the thing that I identify with. The weird thing is I don't actually have an

573
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:28,400
identity beyond the identity that I construct. If I was the Dalai Lama, he identifies as a form

574
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,280
of government. So basically the Dalai Lama gets reborn not because he's confused, but because he

575
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:42,080
is not identifying as a human being. He runs on a human being. He's basically a governmental software

576
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,200
that is instantiated in every new generation in you. So his advisors will pick someone who does

577
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,720
this in the next generation. So if you identify with this, you are no longer a human and you don't

578
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,240
die in the sense that what dies is only the body of the human that you run on. To kill the Dalai

579
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,080
Lama, you have to kill his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a

580
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,080
small part like this, most of us. So for instance, if you have children, you realize something lives

581
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,360
on in them. Or if you spark an idea in the world, something lives on. Or if you identify

582
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,240
with the society around you, because you are in part that you're not just this human being.

583
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,680
Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama in the sense that you,

584
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,280
Joshua Bach, is just a collection of ideas. So you have this operating system on which a bunch of

585
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,600
ideas live and interact. And then once you die, some of them jump off the ship.

586
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,000
Put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction.

587
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,560
It's not physically real. Identity is not a physical concept.

588
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,920
It's basically a representation of different objects on the same world line.

589
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:57,760
But identity lives and dies. Are you attached? What's the fundamental thing? Is it the ideas

590
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,040
that come together to form identity? Or is each individual identity actually a fundamental thing?

591
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,560
It's a representation that you can get agency over if you care. So basically,

592
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,760
you can choose what you identify with if you want to.

593
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:21,200
No, but it just seems if the mind is not real, that the birth and death is not a crucial part of

594
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:34,720
it. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism, but it seems that being a physical

595
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,680
object in this world is an important aspect of birth and death. It feels like it has to be

596
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,680
physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die.

597
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,040
The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the

598
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,400
real world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to

599
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,120
model reality with oscillators. So colors and sound, in some sense, have octaves,

600
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,760
and it's because they are represented properly with oscillators. So that's why colors form a

601
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,360
circle of views. And colors have harmonics, sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing

602
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:17,760
oscillators in the brain. So the world that we subjectively interact with is fundamentally

603
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,400
the result of the representation mechanisms in our brain. They are mathematically, to some degree,

604
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,960
universal. There are certain regularities that you can discover in the patterns and not others.

605
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,280
But the patterns that we get, this is not the real world. The world that we interact with is

606
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,080
always made of too many parts to count. So when you look at this table and so on,

607
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,280
it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count them. So you only look

608
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,440
at the aggregate dynamics, at limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely many particles,

609
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,840
what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get. So geometry that

610
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,800
we are interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that work in the

611
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,280
limit that you get by building an infinite series that converges. For those parts where

612
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,040
it converges is geometry. For those parts where it doesn't converge, it's chaos.

613
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:11,840
Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the consciousness that's emergent in our

614
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,640
narrative. So the consciousness gives it color, gives it feeling, gives it flavor.

615
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,360
So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has to all the

616
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,360
other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color

617
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:35,280
is given by those aspects of the representation or this experiential color where you care about,

618
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,520
where you have identifications, where something means something, where you are the inside of a

619
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,960
feedback loop. And the dimensions of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system

620
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,640
that we emerge over. The meaning of the relations, the graph. Can you elaborate

621
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:57,600
that a little bit? Maybe we can even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness

622
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,680
to be sort of more systematic? How do you think about consciousness?

623
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,800
I think that consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism

624
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,560
that has evolved for a certain type of learning. At the moment, our machine learning systems

625
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:21,760
largely work by building chains of weighted sums of real numbers with some non-linearity.

626
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,280
And you will learn by piping an error signal through these different chain layers and adjusting

627
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,280
the weights in these weighted sums. And you can approximate most polynomials with this

628
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,200
if you have enough training data. But the price is you need to change a lot of these weights.

629
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,560
Basically, the error is piped backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures

630
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,360
in the network. And everything else evens out statistically. And only at these junctures,

631
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,880
this is where you had the actual error in the network and you make the change there. This is

632
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,360
a very slow process. And our brains don't have enough time for that because we don't get old

633
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:04,320
enough to play Go the way that our machines learn to play Go. So instead, what we do is an

634
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,400
attention-based learning. We pinpoint the probable region in the network where we

635
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:15,440
can make an improvement. And then we store this binding state together with the expected outcome

636
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,240
in a protocol. And this ability to make indexed memories for the purpose of learning to revisit

637
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,720
these commitments later, this requires a memory of the contents of our attention.

638
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,600
Another aspect is when I construct my reality, I make mistakes. So I see things that turn out

639
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,800
to be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features

640
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,800
of my perception gave rise to the present construction of reality. So the system needs

641
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,800
to pay attention to the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs

642
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,560
to pay attention to whether it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system

643
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:57,120
gets trained with the same mechanism, so it's reflexive, but also in part because your attention

644
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,080
lapses if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. So it's the thing that I'm currently

645
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,600
seeing, just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream, or am I still

646
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,480
paying attention to my percept? So you have to periodically go back and see whether you're still

647
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,800
paying attention. And if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the system

648
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,120
becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention itself

649
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,600
and makes attention the object of its attention, I think this is the loop over which we wake up.

650
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,360
So there's this attentional mechanism that's somehow self-referential,

651
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:37,520
that's fundamental to what consciousness is. So just to ask you a question, I don't know how

652
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,400
much you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing, they use attentional

653
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:51,440
mechanism, they use something called transformers to learn patterns and sentences by allowing a

654
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,200
work to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence at each individual. So like

655
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,680
parametrize and make it learnable, the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window

656
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:12,160
into the sentence. Do you think that's like a little step towards that eventually will take us

657
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:17,840
to the attentional mechanisms from which consciousness can emerge? Not quite. I think

658
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:24,080
it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated language translation,

659
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,960
there was an example that I found particularly funny where somebody tried to translate a text

660
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,800
from English into German and it was a bat broke the window. And the translation in German was

661
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,600
eine Fledermaus zerbracht das Fenster mit einem Baseballschläger. So to translate back into English

662
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:51,360
a bat, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bat. And it seemed to be the most similar

663
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:57,200
to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating the concept bat

664
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,480
into German in the same sentence. And this is a mistake that the transformer model is not doing

665
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,200
because it's tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism in the transformer model is basically

666
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,680
putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up later in the text

667
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,160
and tracks basically the individuals through the text. And that's why the system can learn

668
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,320
things that other systems couldn't before it, which makes it, for instance, possible to write

669
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,880
a text where it talks about the scientist, then the scientist has a name and has a pronoun, and

670
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,160
it gets a consistent story about that thing. What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this.

671
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,120
So this meaning falls apart at some point. It loses track of this context. It does not yet

672
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,600
understand that everything that it says has to refer to the same universe. And this is where this

673
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,800
thing falls apart. But the attention in the transformer model does not go beyond tracking

674
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,840
identity. And tracking identity is an important part of attention, but it's a different, very

675
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,560
specific attentional mechanism. And it's not the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness

676
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,280
that we have. Just to linger on, what do you mean by identity in the context of language?

677
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,200
So when you talk about language, you have different words that can refer to the same concept.

678
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:15,840
Got it. So space of concepts. Yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or

679
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,160
inexical sense that you say this word does not only refer to this class of objects,

680
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,160
but it refers to a definite object, to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story,

681
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,360
and is only referred by different ways in the language. So the language is basically a

682
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:40,080
projection from a conceptual representation, from a scene that is evolving into a discrete

683
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:46,320
string of symbols. And what the transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection

684
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,360
mechanism that other models couldn't learn. So have you ever seen an artificial intelligence

685
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:57,360
or any kind of construction idea that allows for, unlike neural networks or perhaps within

686
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:04,080
neural networks, that's able to form something where the space of concepts continues to be

687
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:10,720
integrated? So what you're describing, building a knowledge base, building this consistent,

688
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,880
larger and larger sets of ideas that would then allow for deeper understanding?

689
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,640
Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything from language, from basically a logical

690
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,680
grammatical construct. And I think to some degree, this was also what Minsky believed.

691
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,760
So that's why he focused so much on common sense reasoning and so on. And

692
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,880
a project that was inspired by him was Psyche.

693
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,160
That's still going on.

694
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,240
Yes. Of course, ideas don't die. Only people die.

695
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:42,960
That's true.

696
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,600
And Psyche is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to

697
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,080
converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve,

698
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,720
and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations,

699
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,600
was the notion of images. So images play an important role in tractatus. The tractatus

700
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,000
is an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical programming language, to design a logical

701
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,880
language in which you can do actual philosophy that's rich enough for doing this. And the

702
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,040
difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually, I think he decided that he was

703
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:23,120
not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the Logitus program in AI. And

704
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,920
the solution, as we see it today, is we need more general function approximation. There are

705
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,960
functions, geometric functions, that we learn to approximate that cannot be efficiently expressed

706
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,080
and computed in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory

707
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:45,200
and so on to learn in algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry. But to equate

708
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,320
language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it.

709
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,960
So functional, well, you kind of just said that neural networks are sort of,

710
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,080
the approach that neural networks takes is actually more general than what can be expressed through

711
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,640
language. Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed through language at the data rates

712
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,920
at which we process grammatical language. Okay. So you don't think languages,

713
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,440
so you disagree with Wittgenstein that language is not fundamental to...

714
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:22,640
I agree with Wittgenstein. I just agree with the late Wittgenstein. And I also agree with the

715
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,280
beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the tractatus itself is probably the most beautiful

716
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,960
philosophical text that was written in the 20th century. But language is not fundamental to

717
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,080
cognition and intelligence and consciousness. So I think that language is a particular way,

718
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,080
or the natural language that we're using is a particular level of abstraction that we

719
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:48,000
use to communicate with each other. But the languages in which we express geometry

720
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,240
are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly different. They're more

721
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:58,400
general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a model is you have a bunch of

722
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,560
parameters. These have a range. These are the variances of the world. And you have relationships

723
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,040
between them, which are constraints, which say if certain parameters have these values,

724
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:15,440
then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very early insight in

725
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,160
computer science. And I think some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine.

726
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,400
And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that it has a measure of whether it's good. This is

727
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,160
basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the constraints,

728
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,840
where the constraints don't quite match. It's very difficult to, despite having this global measure,

729
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:39,360
to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially few elements,

730
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,520
parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.

731
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:51,520
And so the solution that Hinton and Sanofsky found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine,

732
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,160
which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine, and only

733
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,200
has based the input and output layer. But this limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machine.

734
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,600
So now he builds a network of small of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense,

735
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,080
you can see almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we're using

736
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,640
today, even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the

737
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,320
Boltzmann machine is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception,

738
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,400
and this forces the entire machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that

739
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:28,160
you currently perceive. And this state is your model of the world. Right. So I think it's a

740
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:34,400
very general way of thinking about models, but we have to use a different approach to make it work.

741
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,440
This is we have to find different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism

742
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,120
that trains the Boltzmann machine and the mechanism that makes the Boltzmann machine

743
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,920
settle into its state are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine

744
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,160
itself. The kind of mechanism that we want to develop, you're saying? Yes. So there's a

745
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,440
direction in which I think our research is going to go. It's going to, for instance,

746
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,160
what you notice in perception is our perceptual models of the world are not probabilistic,

747
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:09,520
but possibleistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that are improbable, but possible.

748
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,200
Right. Perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's possible,

749
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,760
if it's coherent. So if you see a tiger coming after, you should be able to see this,

750
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:26,320
even if it's unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the model. So

751
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:32,240
given the state of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features,

752
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,600
how should you change the states of the model to get it to converge with your perception?

753
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:46,320
But the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing

754
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:53,520
is perhaps not as large. I mean, that's perhaps pretty small. The degree of coherence that you

755
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,640
need to achieve depends, of course, how deep your models go. For instance, politics is very simple

756
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,960
when you know very little about game theory and human nature. So the younger you are,

757
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,880
the more obvious this is how politics should work. Because you get coherent aesthetics from

758
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,480
relatively few inputs. And the more layers you model, the more layers you model reality,

759
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:21,280
the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints. So, you know, the current neural networks are

760
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,240
fundamentally supervised learning system with a feed forward neural network is back propagation

761
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,920
to learn. What's your intuition about what kind of mechanisms might we move towards to improve

762
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:38,960
the learning procedure? I think one big aspect is going to be meta learning and architecture search

763
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:44,720
starts in this direction. In some sense, the first wave of classical AI work by identifying

764
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,880
a problem into a possible solution and implementing the solution, right program that plays chess.

765
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:54,880
And right now we are in the second wave of AI. So instead of writing the algorithm that implements

766
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,920
the solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches for an algorithm that

767
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:05,360
implements the solution. So the learning system in some sense is an algorithm that itself discovers

768
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,400
the algorithm that solves the problem like Go. Go is too hard to implement the solution by hand,

769
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,440
but we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution. So now let's move to the third stage,

770
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,000
right? The third stage would be meta learning. Find an algorithm that discovers a learning

771
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,920
algorithm for the given domain. Our brain is probably not a learning system, but a meta

772
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,520
learning system. This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way if you

773
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,760
look at the way our brain is, for instance, implemented. There is no central control that

774
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,560
tells all the neurons how to wire up. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement

775
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,200
learning agent. Every neuron is a single-celled organism that is quite complicated and in some

776
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,240
sense quite motivated to get fed. And it gets fed if it fires on average at the right time.

777
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:56,800
And the right time depends on the context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical

778
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,080
and chemical environment that it has. So it basically has to learn a function over its

779
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,320
environment that tells us when to fire to get fed. Or if you see it as a reinforcement

780
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:11,200
learning agent, every neuron is in some sense making a hypothesis when it sends a signal

781
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,840
and tries to pipe a signal through the universe and tries to get positive feedback for it.

782
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,720
And the entire thing is set up in such a way that it's robustly self-organizing into a brain,

783
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,000
which means you start out with different neuron types that have different priors on which

784
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,960
hypothesis to test on how to get its reward. And you put them into different concentrations

785
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,320
in a certain spatial alignment. And then you entrain it in a particular order.

786
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,720
And as a result, you get a well-organized brain.

787
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:46,160
Yeah. So the brain is a meta-learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning agents.

788
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:54,480
And I think you said, but just to clarify, there's no centralized

789
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:00,640
government that tells you, here's a loss function, here's a loss function, here's a loss function.

790
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,640
Who says what's the objective of what's been happening?

791
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,880
There are also governments which impose loss functions on different parts of the brain.

792
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,800
So we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain get especially rewarded when

793
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,880
you look at faces. If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia, which basically

794
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,280
the inability to tell people apart by their faces. And the reason that happens is because

795
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,000
it had an evolutionary advantage. So evolution comes into play here.

796
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,080
It's basically an extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don't think that

797
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,360
people with prosopagnosia have per se a defective brain. The brain just has an average attention

798
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,680
for faces. So people with prosopagnosia don't look at faces more than they look at cups.

799
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:48,400
So the level at which they resolve the geometry of faces is not higher than for cups. And people

800
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:53,680
that don't have prosopagnosia look obsessively at faces, right? For you and me, it's impossible

801
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,880
to move through a crowd without scanning the faces. And as a result, we make insanely detailed

802
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,080
models of faces that allow us to discern mental states of people.

803
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:08,560
So obviously we don't know 99% of the details of this meta-learning system that's in our mind.

804
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,960
But still we took a leap from something much dumber to that through the evolutionary process.

805
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:25,920
Can you first of all maybe say how big of a leap is that from our brain, from our ape

806
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:38,320
ancestors to multi-cell organisms? And as we start to think about how to engineer intelligence,

807
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:45,520
is there something we can learn from evolution? In some sense, life exists because of the market

808
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,280
opportunity of controlled chemical reactions. We compete with dumb chemical reactions and we

809
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,400
win in some areas against the dumb combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients

810
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,080
where you need to add a little bit of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy.

811
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,160
So we out-competed combustion.

812
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,720
Yes, in many regions we do. We try very hard because when we are in direct competition,

813
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:12,400
we lose, right? Because the combustion is going to close the entropy gradients much

814
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:20,560
faster than we can run. So basically we do this because every cell has a Turing machine built into

815
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:27,840
it. It's like literally a read-write head on a tape. So everything that's more complicated

816
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:34,480
than a molecule that just is a vortex around the tractors, that needs a Turing machine for

817
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:40,160
its regulation. And then you bind cells together and you get next level organization, an organism

818
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:47,040
where the cells together implement some kind of software. And for me, a very interesting discovery

819
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:51,520
in the last year was the word spirit because I realized that what spirit actually means

820
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,760
it's an operating system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented,

821
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,000
people needed this word, but they didn't have robots that they built themselves.

822
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,720
The only autonomous robots that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities,

823
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:09,680
and so on. And they all had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant has an operating

824
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,920
system, right? If you pinch the plant in one area, then it's going to have repercussions

825
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,800
throughout the plant. Everything in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics

826
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,760
like in other organisms. An organism is not a collection of cells, it's a function that

827
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:30,160
tells cells how to behave. And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing,

828
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:36,560
like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each cell with each

829
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:44,560
other cell. Oh my God. So what you're saying is the organism is a function that tells what

830
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:53,760
to do and the function emerges from the interaction of the cells.

831
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,680
Yes. So it's basically a description of what the plant is doing in terms of macrostates.

832
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,080
And the macrostates, the physical implementation are too many of them to describe them. So the

833
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,880
software that we use to describe what the plant is doing, the spirit of the plant is the software,

834
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,160
the operating system of the plant, right? This is a way in which we, the observers,

835
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:20,560
make sense of the plant. And the same is true for people. So people have spirits,

836
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,720
which is their operating system in a way, right? And there are aspects of that operating system

837
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:29,520
that relate to how your body functions and others, how you socially interact, how you interact with

838
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:36,240
yourself and so on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it's a loaded term because

839
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:42,480
it's from a pre-scientific age. But it took the scientific age a long time to rediscover a term

840
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,440
that is pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the differences that we still see between the

841
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,040
old word and the new word are translation errors that have been over the centuries.

842
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,400
Can you actually linger on that? Why do you say that spirit? Just to clarify,

843
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:01,680
because I'm a little bit confused. So the word spirit is a powerful thing. But why did you say

844
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,800
in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a

845
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:12,880
spirit? I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality in the US,

846
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,800
it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture.

847
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,960
And a culture is in some sense, you could say the spirit of a society that is long game.

848
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,280
This thing that becomes self-aware at a level above the individuals where you say,

849
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:34,000
if you don't do the following things, then the grand grandchildren of our children will not have

850
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,760
nothing to eat. So if you take this long scope where you try to maximize the length of the game

851
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,760
that you are playing as a species, you realize that you are part of a larger thing that you

852
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,440
cannot fully control. You probably need to submit to the ecosphere instead of trying to completely

853
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:55,360
control it. There needs to be a certain level at which we can exist as a species if you want to

854
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:01,120
endure. And our culture is not sustaining this anymore. We basically made this bet with the

855
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,960
Industrial Revolution that we can control everything. And the modernist societies with

856
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:11,200
basically unfettered growth led to a situation in which we depend on the ability to control

857
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:18,080
the entire planet. And since we are not able to do that, as it seems, this culture will die.

858
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,120
We realize that it doesn't have a future. We called our children generations that

859
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,680
it's such a very optimistic thing to do. Yeah. So you can have this kind of intuition that

860
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:37,840
our civilization, you said culture, but you really mean the spirit of the civilization,

861
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:45,920
the entirety of the civilization may not exist for long. Can you untangle that? What's your

862
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,120
intuition behind that? So you kind of offline mentioned to me that the Industrial Revolution

863
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:59,440
was kind of the moment we agreed to accept the offer sign on the paper on the dotted line with

864
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,720
the Industrial Revolution, we doomed ourselves. Can you elaborate on that? There's a suspicion.

865
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:11,440
I of course don't know how it plays out, but it seems to me that in a society in which you

866
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:17,120
leverage yourself very far over an entropic abyss without land on the other side,

867
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:22,160
it's relatively clear that your cantilever is at some point going to break down into this

868
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:28,960
entropic abyss and you have to pay the bill. Okay. Russia is my first language and I'm also an idiot.

869
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:39,840
This is just two apes instead of playing with the banana trying to have fun by talking. Okay.

870
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:47,600
Anthropic what? And what's entropic? Entropic. So entropic in the sense of entropy. Oh,

871
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:55,920
entropic. What was the other word? Abyss. What's that? It's a big gorge. Oh, abyss. Abyss, yes.

872
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:01,280
Entropic abyss. So many of the things you say are poetic. It's hurting my brain. It's amazing,

873
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:10,640
right? It's mispronounced, which makes it even more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So

874
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:18,960
entropic abyss. Okay. Let's rewind then the Industrial Revolution. So how does that get us

875
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:25,280
into the entropic abyss? So in some sense, we burned a hundred million years worth of trees

876
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:31,040
to get everybody plumbing. Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number

877
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:39,520
of people. So basically since zero BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. And this only

878
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:45,360
changed with the Enlightenment and the subsequent Industrial Revolution. And in some sense,

879
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:51,200
the Enlightenment freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the pre-existing order

880
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:56,240
gradually. And it was a process that basically happened in feedback loops. So it was not that

881
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:02,160
just one caused the other. It was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically

882
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:09,200
increasing productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the

883
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:16,000
definition of poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die,

884
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,040
which is in some sense the state that all animals on earth are in.

885
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,040
The definition of poverty is having enough- So you can have only so many children as you can

886
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:30,000
feed. And if you have more, they die. Yes. And in our societies, you can basically have as many

887
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:36,080
children as you want and they don't die. Right. So the reason why we don't have as many children

888
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,400
as we want is because we also have to pay a price in terms of we have to insert ourselves in the

889
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:46,080
lower social stratum if we have too many. So basically everybody in the under middle and

890
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:51,200
lower upper class has only a limited number of children because having more of them would mean

891
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:56,160
a big economic hit to the individual families. Yes. Because children, especially in the US,

892
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,840
super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of this if you are basically super rich

893
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,280
or if you are super poor. If you're super poor, it doesn't matter how many kids you have because

894
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:09,840
your status is not going to change. And these children are largely not going to die of hunger.

895
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,920
So how does this lead to self-destruction? So there's a lot of unpleasant properties

896
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,800
about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to let our children survive,

897
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:29,680
even if they have diseases. Like I would have died before my mid-twenties without modern medicine

898
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:35,680
and most of my friends would have as well. So many of us wouldn't live without the advantages

899
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:42,000
of modern medicine and modern industrialized society. We get our protein largely by subduing

900
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
the entirety of nature. Imagine there would be some very clever microbe that would live in our

901
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:56,240
organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into a thing that is necessary

902
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,800
to sustain itself. And it would discover that, for instance, brain cells are kind of edible,

903
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,520
but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them and you turn them into more fat

904
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,880
cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable that is barely alive and it's going

905
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,680
to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment changes. Yeah. But some part of that

906
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:21,280
organism, the one that's actually doing all the using of the, there'll still be somebody thriving.

907
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:28,640
So it relates back to this original question. I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on

908
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,520
this planet. I suspect that basically every complex system has to have some complex regulation

909
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:41,520
if it depends on feedback loops. And so for instance, it's likely that we should describe

910
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,240
a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is that plants don't have a nervous

911
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:51,440
system. So they don't have a way to telegraph messages over large distances almost instantly

912
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:56,800
in the plant. And instead they will rely on chemicals between adjacent cells, which means

913
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,600
the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with a rate of a few

914
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:07,680
millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is intelligent, it's not going to be

915
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:13,360
intelligent at similar timescales. Yeah. The time scale is different. So you suspect

916
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:19,600
we might not be the most intelligent, but we're the most intelligent in this

917
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:25,600
spatial scale and our time scale. So basically if you would zoom out very far, we might discover

918
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:31,680
that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet that existed for thousands of years in an

919
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,080
almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these ecosystems actively related their

920
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:41,040
environment. So basically change the course of the evolution within this ecosystem to make it

921
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,320
more efficient and less brittle. So it's possible something like plants is actually a set of living

922
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,440
organisms, an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating at different timescale and

923
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,840
are far superior in intelligence than human beings. And then human beings will die out

924
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:01,680
and plants will still be there and they'll be there. Yeah. There's an evolutionary adaptation

925
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,840
playing a role at all of these levels. For instance, if mice don't get enough food

926
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,600
and get stressed, the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny.

927
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:14,640
And the reason for this is because in the natural environment, the mice have probably

928
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:20,480
hidden a drought or something else. And if they overgraze, then all the things that sustain them

929
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:25,680
might go extinct and there will be no mice a few generations from now. So to make sure that there

930
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:30,880
will be mice in five generations from now, basically the mice scale back. And a similar

931
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,480
thing happens with the predators of mice. They should make sure that the mice don't completely

932
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:40,000
go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked with

933
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,320
shepherding their food supply. Maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains than antelopes

934
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:51,920
is not so much because it's so hard to catch an antelope as opposed to run away from the lion.

935
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:57,200
But the lions need to make complex models of their environment, more complex than the antelopes.

936
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,080
So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may

937
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:06,000
not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on earth,

938
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,720
makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.

939
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,000
Yes, maybe we are just Gaia's ploy to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.

940
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,640
Yeah, this is just a nice, we tried it out.

941
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,120
The big stain on evolution is not us, it was trees.

942
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:24,480
Earth evolved trees before they could be digested again. There were no insects that could break all

943
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:30,560
of them apart. Cellulose is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms,

944
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,360
so many of these trees fell into swarms, and all this carbon became inert and could no longer be

945
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,080
recycled into organisms. And we are the species that is destined to take care of that.

946
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,960
So this is kind of...

947
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,400
To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere, and the earth is already greening.

948
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:51,280
So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes

949
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,760
that they're not compatible with right now, the earth is going to be awesome again.

950
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,560
And there won't be even a memory of us little apes.

951
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,720
I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first generally intelligent species

952
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,560
in this sense. We are the first species with an industrial society because we

953
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,120
will leave more phones than bones in this stratosphere.

954
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,880
Phones than bones, I like it. But then let me push back. You've kind of suggested that

955
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:22,960
we have a very narrow definition of... I mean, why aren't trees more general,

956
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,000
a higher level of general intelligence?

957
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,680
Well, if trees were intelligent, then they would be at different timescales,

958
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:33,440
which means within 100 years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are

959
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,440
as complex as the ones that we make in 10 years.

960
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,840
But maybe the trees are the ones that made the phones, right?

961
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,560
You could say the entirety of life did it. The first cell never died.

962
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:52,560
The first cell only split and every divided. And every cell in our body is still an instance

963
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,000
of the first cell that split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell on

964
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,120
this planet as far as we know. And so the cell is not just a building block of life.

965
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,640
It's a hypoorganism. And we are part of this hypoorganism.

966
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:12,800
So nevertheless, this hypoorganism, no, this little particular branch of it,

967
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,680
which is us humans because of the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth

968
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:24,160
of technology might somehow destroy ourselves. So what do you think is the most likely way we

969
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:29,840
might destroy ourselves? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we've

970
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:35,040
talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial

971
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:42,320
intelligence destroying us. Some people worry about nuclear weapons and weapons of war in general.

972
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:47,520
What do you think? If you were a betting man, what would you bet on in terms of self-destruction?

973
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:55,280
And would it be higher than 50%? So it's very likely that nothing that we bet on matters

974
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,640
after we win our bets. So I don't think that bets are literally the right way to go about this.

975
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,880
I mean, once you're dead, you won't be there to collect the winnings.

976
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:10,560
It's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present civilization is not

977
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,200
sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably fewer people on the planet

978
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:20,320
than there are today. And even if not, then still most of people that are alive today will not have

979
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,880
offspring in 100 years from now because of the geographic changes and so on and the changes in

980
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:31,200
the food supply. It's quite likely that many areas of the planet will only be livable with a close

981
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:38,400
cooling chain in 100 years from now. So many of the areas around the equator and in subtropical

982
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:44,160
climates that are now quite pleasant to live in will stop to be inhabitable without air conditioning.

983
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:48,880
So you honestly, wow, cooling chain, close-knit cooling chain communities.

984
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:54,720
So you think you have a strong worry about the effects of global warming?

985
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,120
By itself, it's not a big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three

986
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:04,080
months in the summer in which you cannot be outside. And so you have a close cooling chain,

987
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,760
you have air conditioning in your car and in your home and you're fine. And if the air conditioning

988
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,360
would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive, right?

989
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:20,640
Can we just pause for a second? You say so many brilliant poetic things. Do people use that term

990
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:26,720
closed cooling chain? I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get meat into a

991
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,200
supermarket, right? If you break the cooling chain and this thing starts to thaw, you're in trouble

992
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:37,200
and you have to throw it away. That's such a beautiful way to put it. It's like calling a city

993
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,480
a closed social chain or something like that. I mean, that's right. I mean, the locality of it

994
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,760
is really important. Yeah, but it basically means you wake up in a climatized room, you go to work

995
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,400
in a climatized car, you work in a climatized office, you shop in a climatized supermarket

996
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,960
and in between you have very short distance which you run from your car to the supermarket,

997
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,360
but you have to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of the

998
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,520
environment. The crucial thing is the wet bulb temperature. The what? The wet bulb temperature.

999
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:10,960
It's what you get when you take a wet cloth and you put it around your thermometer and then you

1000
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:18,160
move it very quickly through the air so you get the evaporation heat. And as soon as you can no

1001
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:24,800
longer cool your body temperature via evaporation to a temperature below something like I think 35

1002
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:33,040
degrees, you die. Which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down by sweating

1003
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,280
but if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature,

1004
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:42,880
then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you're a healthy, fit individual within

1005
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:48,080
a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on, you'll die. Unless you have some

1006
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:54,320
climatizing equipment. And this itself, as long as you maintain civilization and you have energy

1007
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:58,480
supply and you have food trucks coming to your home that are climatized, everything is fine.

1008
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:04,080
But what if you lose large scale open agriculture at the same time? So basically you run into food

1009
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:09,120
insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very irregular and you have a

1010
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:16,400
lot of extreme weather events. So you need to roll most of your food maybe indoor or you need to

1011
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,360
import your food from certain regions. And maybe you're not able to maintain the civilization

1012
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:25,200
throughout the planet to get the infrastructure to get the food to your home.

1013
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,480
But there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer.

1014
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:35,680
There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you not have a

1015
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:46,000
faith, but what do you make of the capacity of technological innovation to help us prevent

1016
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:53,280
some of the worst damages that this condition can create? So as an example,

1017
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,800
as an almost out there example, is the work that SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to

1018
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:07,120
also consider our propagation throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets.

1019
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:12,560
That's one technological step. But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to save us

1020
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:18,080
from global warming because Mars looks much worse than Earth will look like after the worst

1021
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:23,520
outcomes of global warming imaginable, right? Mars is essentially not habitable.

1022
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,240
It's exceptionally harsh environment, yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people throughout

1023
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:32,960
history since the Industrial Revolution are doing, are just doing a lot of different technological

1024
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,680
innovation with some kind of target. And when it ends up happening, it's totally unexpected.

1025
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:44,800
New things come up. So trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars, an extremely harsh

1026
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:52,000
environment, might give us totally new ideas of how to expand or increase the power of this

1027
01:33:52,720 --> 01:34:01,520
closed cooling circuit that empowers the community. So it seems like there's a little bit of a race

1028
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:11,200
between our open-ended technological innovation of this communal operating system that we have

1029
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:19,120
and our general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves.

1030
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,880
You don't think technology can win that race? I think the probability is relatively low,

1031
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:32,640
given that our technology is stagnating since the 1970s, roughly, in terms of technology.

1032
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:36,480
Most of the things that we do are the result of incremental processes.

1033
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,800
What about Intel? What about Moore's Law?

1034
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,320
It's basically, it's very incremental. The things that we're doing is,

1035
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:49,440
so the invention of the microprocessor was a major thing, right? The miniaturization

1036
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:56,560
of transistors was really major. But the things that we did afterwards largely were not that

1037
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:06,560
innovative. We had gradual changes of scaling things from CPUs into GPUs and things like that.

1038
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,440
But I don't think that there are, basically, there are not many things. If you take a person

1039
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:16,560
that died in the 70s and was at the top of their game, they would not need to read that many books

1040
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,920
to be current again. But it's all about books. Who cares about books?

1041
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,880
There might be things that are beyond books. Or say papers.

1042
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,960
No, papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are, so papers and books and knowledge,

1043
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:34,720
that's a concept of a time when you were sitting there by candlelight and individual consumers

1044
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:40,480
of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not in the middle of, might not be understanding

1045
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:46,800
of Twitter, of YouTube? The reason you and I are sitting here today is because of Twitter and

1046
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:54,240
YouTube. So the ripple effect, and there's two minds, sort of two dumb apes, coming up with the

1047
01:35:54,240 --> 01:36:02,080
new, perhaps a new clean insights. And there's 200,000 other apes listening right now. And

1048
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,760
that effect, it's very difficult to understand what that effect will have. That might be bigger

1049
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,000
than any of the advancements in the microprocessor or in the industrial revolution,

1050
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:22,480
the ability of spread knowledge. And that knowledge, it allows good ideas to reach

1051
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:28,560
millions much faster. And the effect of that, that might be the new, that might be the 21st century,

1052
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:35,200
is the multiplying of ideas, of good ideas. Because if you say one good thing today,

1053
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,360
that will multiply across huge amounts of people. And then they will say something,

1054
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,720
and then they will have another podcast, and they'll say something, and then they'll write

1055
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:51,520
a paper. That could be a huge, you don't think that- Yeah, we should have billions of von Neumanns

1056
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,160
right now in two rings, and we don't for some reason. I suspect the reason is that we destroy

1057
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:00,640
our attention span. Also, the incentives are of course different. Yeah, we have some Kardashians,

1058
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:04,640
yeah. So the reason why we are sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because

1059
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:08,480
you and me don't have the attention span to write a book together right now, and you guys

1060
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,240
probably don't have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you- But I guarantee you they're

1061
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:18,960
still listening. ... take care of your attention. It's very short. But we're an hour and 40 minutes

1062
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:23,840
in, and I guarantee you that 80% of the people are still listening. So there is an attention span.

1063
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:29,760
It's just the form. Who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information?

1064
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,360
That's still an open question. I mean, that's what we're- There's something that social media

1065
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,680
could be doing that other forms could not be doing. I think the end game of social media is

1066
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:42,560
a global brain, and Twitter is in some sense a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine,

1067
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,800
doesn't have any kind of inhibition, and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure.

1068
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,560
Yes. It's also in some sense a multiplayer role-playing game, and people use it to play

1069
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,800
an avatar that is not like them as they were in this sane world, and they look through the world

1070
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,400
through the lens of their phones and think it's the real world, but it's the Twitter world that

1071
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:06,400
is distorted by the popularity incentives of Twitter. Yeah. The incentives and just our natural

1072
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:17,760
biological, the dopamine rush of alike, no matter how- I try to be very zen-like and minimalist and

1073
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,160
not be influenced by likes and so on, but it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some

1074
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:31,360
degree. Speaking at a small tangent of Twitter, how can Twitter be done better?

1075
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:37,360
I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society by doing exactly what

1076
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:41,680
you're doing. Sorry, doing exactly what you described, which is having this-

1077
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:50,080
We're like, is this some kind of game, and we're kind of individual RL agents in this game,

1078
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:54,080
and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey nor

1079
01:38:54,080 --> 01:39:01,520
the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control this game, or can they? That's sort of

1080
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:06,800
a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control this game? I wouldn't give advice

1081
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:14,000
because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this. Our brain has solved

1082
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,360
this problem to some degree. Our brain has lots of individual agents that manage to play together

1083
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:24,720
in a way, and they have also many contexts in which other organisms have found ways to solve

1084
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:32,240
the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter. Maybe the solution is to go for an

1085
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:39,120
evolutionary approach. Imagine that you have something like Reddit or something like Facebook

1086
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:43,040
and something like Twitter, and you think about what they have in common. What they have in common

1087
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:49,280
are companies that in some sense own a protocol, and this protocol is imposed on a community,

1088
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:55,280
and the protocol has different components for monetization, for user management, for user

1089
01:39:55,280 --> 01:40:00,480
display, for rating, for anonymity, for import of other content, and so on. Now imagine that you

1090
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:07,120
take these components of the protocol apart, and you do it in some sense like communities within

1091
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:11,920
this social network, and these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and

1092
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:18,240
design new ones. For instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community. The rules for

1093
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:23,600
sharing content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you

1094
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:29,440
reward individual users for what can be redefined. The way users can represent themselves and to

1095
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:35,120
each other can be redefined. Who could be the redefiner? Can individual human beings build

1096
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:39,440
enough intuition to redefine those things? Itself can become part of the protocol. For instance,

1097
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:44,240
it could be in some communities it will be a single person that comes up with these things,

1098
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:49,120
and others it's a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting

1099
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:53,280
weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self-organizing principle for this?

1100
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,480
But the process can't be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain...

1101
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:02,000
It can be automated so people can write a software for this, and eventually the idea is

1102
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,800
let's not make an assumption about this thing if you don't know what the right solution is.

1103
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:12,160
In those areas we have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc

1104
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:17,920
or machines doing this. Whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia

1105
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:23,120
or with software solutions or with AI that goes through the posts of people or with a

1106
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:29,040
legal principle and so on. This is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would be

1107
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:35,200
if you let the communities evolve and you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing

1108
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:42,000
the most sentient communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors that

1109
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,120
allow you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals. So you have a network that

1110
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:51,760
gives you information that is relevant to you. It helps you to maintain relationships to others

1111
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,720
in healthy ways. It allows you to build teams. It allows you to basically bring the best of you

1112
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:01,280
into this thing and goes into a coupling, into a relationship with others in which you produce

1113
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:08,160
things that you would be unable to produce alone. Yes, beautifully put. But the key process of that

1114
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:17,120
with incentives and evolution is things that don't adopt themselves to effectively get the

1115
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:24,080
incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or whatever

1116
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:29,440
you want to define as the incentives really don't like dying. One of the things that people really

1117
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:36,320
protest aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America. I don't know much about

1118
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:42,000
the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of censorship is really painful

1119
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:53,280
in America. And so what do you think about that having grown up in East Germany?

1120
01:42:53,280 --> 01:43:00,320
Do you think censorship is an important tool in our brain, in the intelligence, and in

1121
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:08,880
the social networks? So basically, if you're not a good member of the entirety of the system,

1122
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,920
then you should be blocked away. Well, locked away, blocked.

1123
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,600
An important thing is who decides that you are a good member.

1124
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,200
Who? Is it distributed or?

1125
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:22,400
And what is the outcome of the process that decides it, both for the individual and for

1126
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:27,360
society at large? For instance, if you have a high trust society, you don't need a lot of

1127
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:33,040
surveillance. And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining trust, because it's

1128
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:40,240
basically punishing people that look suspicious when surveyed, but do the right thing anyway.

1129
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:45,360
And the opposite, if you have a low trust society, then surveillance can be a better trade-off.

1130
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,920
And the US is currently making a transition from a relatively high trust or mixed trust society to

1131
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,720
a low trust society, so surveillance will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are

1132
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:58,560
not just inert representations. There are implementations that run code on your brain

1133
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,880
and change your reality and change the way you interact with each other at some level.

1134
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:10,000
And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we use to display our alignment. So for

1135
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,240
instance, people might say all cultures are the same and equally good, but still they prefer to

1136
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:21,280
live in some cultures over others. Very, very strongly so. And it turns out that the cultures

1137
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,520
are defined by certain rules of interaction. And these rules of interaction lead to different

1138
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:30,960
results when you implement them. So if you adhere to certain rules, you get different outcomes in

1139
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:36,960
different societies. And this all leads to very tricky situations when people do not have a

1140
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:42,720
commitment to shared purpose. And our societies probably need to rediscover what it means to have

1141
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:50,000
a shared purpose and how to make this compatible with a non-totalitarian view. So in some sense,

1142
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:57,600
the US is caught in a conundrum between totalitarianism and diversity and doesn't

1143
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:02,240
need to how to resolve this. And the solutions that the US has found so far are very crude

1144
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:06,560
because it's a very young society that is also under a lot of tension. It seems to me that the

1145
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:15,360
US will have to reinvent itself. What do you think, just philosophizing, what kind of mechanisms

1146
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,800
of government do you think we as a species should be evolving with? US or broadly,

1147
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:27,200
what do you think will work well as a system? Of course, we don't know. It all seems to work

1148
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:32,640
pretty crapily. Some things worse than others. Some people argue that communism is the best.

1149
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:38,880
Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then

1150
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:44,560
completely discarding the positive effects of government. There's a lot of arguments.

1151
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:52,000
US seems to be doing pretty damn well in the span of history. There's respect for human rights,

1152
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,520
which seems to be a nice feature, not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological

1153
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:02,560
development. People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things.

1154
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,960
What lessons do you draw from that? What kind of government system do you think is good?

1155
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:17,120
Ideally, government should not be perceivable. It should be frictionless. The more you notice

1156
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:22,800
the influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient

1157
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:28,320
the government probably is. A government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes

1158
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:35,920
an offset on your payout metrics to make your national equilibrium compatible with the common

1159
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:43,840
good. You have these situations where people act on these local incentives. Everybody does

1160
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,000
the thing that's locally the best for them, but the global outcome is not good. This is even the

1161
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,880
case when people care about the global outcome because a regulation mechanism exists that creates

1162
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,040
a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what I do. For instance,

1163
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:02,400
if I think that we should fly less and I stay at home, there's not a single plane that is going to

1164
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:06,560
not start because of me. It's not going to have an influence, but I don't get from A to B.

1165
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:13,360
The way to implement this would be to have a government that is sharing this idea that we

1166
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,360
should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance, makes flying more expensive.

1167
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,600
And it gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation that are

1168
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,840
putting less strain on the environment, for instance.

1169
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:33,680
There's so much optimism in so many things you describe, and yet there's the pessimism of you

1170
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:39,040
think our civilization is going to come to an end. So that's not 100% probability, nothing in this

1171
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:46,240
world is. So what's the trajectory out of self-destruction, do you think?

1172
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,240
I suspect that in some sense, we are both too smart and not smart enough,

1173
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,240
which means we are very good at solving near-term problems. And at the same time,

1174
01:47:54,240 --> 01:48:01,280
we are unwilling to submit to the imperatives that we would have to follow in if we want to

1175
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:07,680
stick around. So that makes it difficult. If you were unable to solve everything technologically,

1176
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:12,400
you can probably understand how high the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate

1177
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:18,160
and how high the mutation rate needs to be to adapt to a slowly changing ecosystem environment.

1178
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:23,120
So you could, in principle, compute all these things game theoretically and adapt to it.

1179
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:29,040
But if you cannot do this because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die,

1180
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:34,960
you will use any kind of medical information to keep child mortality low. Even if it means

1181
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:40,320
that within a few generations, we have enormous genetic drift, and most of us have allergies as

1182
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:44,080
a result of not being adapted to the changes that we made to our food supply.

1183
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:48,400
That's for now, I say, technologically speaking, we're just very young,

1184
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,960
300 years industrial revolution. We're very new to this idea. So you're attached to your

1185
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,840
kids being alive and not being murdered for the greater good of society. But that might be a very

1186
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:04,320
temporary moment of time that we might evolve in our thinking. So like you said, we're both

1187
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,040
smart and not smart enough.

1188
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:12,640
We are probably not this first human civilization that has discovered technology that allows to

1189
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:18,640
efficiently overgraze our resources. And this overgrazing, at some point, we think we can

1190
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:23,040
compensate this because if we have eaten all the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms.

1191
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:29,280
But it could also be that the ecosystems tip. And so what really concerns me is not so much

1192
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:34,400
the end of the civilization because we will invent a new one. But what concerns me is

1193
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:40,320
the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip. So, for instance, maybe the plankton dies

1194
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:45,440
because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over. And as a result, we can no longer

1195
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:50,080
breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning. So basically a major reboot of most

1196
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:56,480
complex organisms on earth. And I think this is a possibility. I don't know what the percentage

1197
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,720
for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be outlandish to me if you look at the scale of

1198
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:06,000
the changes that we've already triggered on this planet. And so Danny Hillis suggests that, for

1199
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,840
instance, we may be able to put chalk into the stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe it

1200
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,640
works. Maybe this is sufficient to counter the effects of what we've done. Maybe it won't be.

1201
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:22,240
Maybe we won't be able to implement it by the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future is

1202
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:28,000
going to play out in this regard. I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue like this.

1203
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,320
All our cousin species, the other hominids are gone.

1204
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:39,760
So the right step would be to what? To rewind towards the industrial revolution and slow

1205
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:47,760
to try to contain the technological process that leads to the overconsumption of resources?

1206
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:54,080
Imagine you get to choose. You have one lifetime. You get born into a sustainable agricultural

1207
01:50:54,080 --> 01:51:01,600
civilization, 300, maybe 400 million people on the planet tops. Or before this, some kind of

1208
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:07,840
nomadic species was like a million or two million. And so you don't meet new people unless you give

1209
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:12,560
birth to them. You cannot travel to other places in the world. There is no internet. There is no

1210
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:16,800
interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep. So you would not discover

1211
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:23,120
to run completeness probably and so on. We wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get born into an

1212
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:28,160
insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned 100 million years worth of

1213
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:34,880
trees in a single century. I think I like this one. It's a very weird thing when you find yourself

1214
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:39,200
on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks like we are not going to miss it.

1215
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:43,280
And a lot of people are in denial. And most of the counter arguments sound like denial to me.

1216
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:48,160
They don't seem to be rational arguments. And the other thing is we are born on this Titanic.

1217
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:51,760
Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have been born. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be talking. We

1218
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:57,200
wouldn't be on the internet. We wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy. And we are not responsible

1219
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:04,320
for this happening. If we had the choice, we would probably try to prevent it. But when we were born,

1220
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,720
we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society we want to be born,

1221
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:13,680
what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively little agency in the entire

1222
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:18,080
thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's basically a giant machine

1223
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,920
that's tumbling down a hill and everybody is frantically trying to push some buttons.

1224
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:27,120
Nobody knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them are not

1225
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:31,680
stopping this tumbling down the hill. Is it possible that artificial intelligence

1226
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:40,560
will give us an escape latch somehow? There's a lot of worry about existential threats of

1227
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:45,840
artificial intelligence. But what AI also allows in general forms of automation

1228
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:54,480
allows the potential of extreme productivity growth that will also perhaps in a positive way

1229
01:52:54,480 --> 01:53:08,080
transform society, that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the same kind of ideals of closer to

1230
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:16,240
nature that's represented in hunter-gatherer societies, that's not destroying the planet,

1231
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:21,440
that's not doing overconsumption and so on. Generally speaking, do you have hope that AI

1232
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:28,640
can help somehow? I think it's not fun to be very close to nature until you completely subdue nature.

1233
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:36,720
Our idea of being close to nature means being close to agriculture, basically forests that

1234
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:43,920
don't have anything in them that eats us. I want to disagree with that. I think the niceness of

1235
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:52,960
being close to nature is to being fully present. When survival becomes your primary,

1236
01:53:53,680 --> 01:54:04,320
not just your goal, but your whole existence, I'm not just romanticizing, I can just speak for

1237
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:12,880
myself. I am self-aware enough that that is a fulfilling existence. I personally prefer to be

1238
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:19,200
in nature and not fight for my survival. I think fighting for your survival while being in the cold

1239
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:24,400
and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having open wounds is very unpleasant.

1240
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:30,560
There's a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you, just as you said, would not choose it.

1241
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,200
But if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling existence.

1242
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:41,520
Yes, if you are adapted to it. Basically, if your brain is fed up in such a way that you get

1243
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:47,600
rewards optimally in such an environment. There's some evidence for this that for a certain degree

1244
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:52,400
of complexity, basically people are more happy in such an environment because it's what we largely

1245
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:57,440
have evolved for. In between, we had a few thousand years in which I think we have evolved for a

1246
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,800
slightly more comfortable environment. So there is probably something like an intermediate stage

1247
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:08,480
in which people would be more happy than they would be if they would have to fend for themselves

1248
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:14,800
in small groups in the forest and often die versus something like this where we now have basically

1249
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:23,280
a big machine, a big mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines

1250
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,080
and largely don't feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are.

1251
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:37,680
So returning briefly to, not briefly, but returning to AI, let me ask a romanticized question. What is

1252
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:44,320
the most beautiful to you, silly ape, the most beautiful or surprising idea in the development

1253
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:48,800
of artificial intelligence, whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence

1254
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:55,840
that you've come across? If you built an AI, it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree

1255
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:01,680
of detail of the world. And then it would try to understand its own nature. It's tempting to think

1256
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:05,680
that at some point when we have general intelligence, we have competitions where we will

1257
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:11,040
let the AIs wake up in different kinds of physical universes and we measure how many movements of the

1258
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:15,920
Rubik's cube it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe and what it is

1259
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:21,280
and its own nature and its own physics and so on. So what if we exist in the memory of an AI

1260
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:25,760
that is trying to understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and remembers

1261
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:31,680
Lex and Joscha sitting in a hotel room, sparking some of the ideas of that led to the development

1262
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:35,520
of general intelligence? So we're a kind of simulation that's running in an AI system

1263
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:41,600
that's trying to understand itself. It's not that I believe that, but I think it's a beautiful

1264
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:51,600
idea. You kind of returned to this idea with the Turing test of intelligence being

1265
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:59,040
the process of asking and answering what is intelligence.

1266
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:11,440
Do you think there is an answer? Why is there such a search for an answer? Does there have to be

1267
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:19,520
like an answer? You just said an AI system that's trying to understand itself.

1268
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:27,680
Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater and greater intelligence?

1269
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:33,440
Is the continuous trying of understanding itself? No, I think you will find that most people don't

1270
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:38,800
care about that because they're well adjusted enough to not care. And the reason why people

1271
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,120
like you and me care about it probably has to do with the need to understand ourselves.

1272
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:47,120
It's because we are in fundamental disagreement with the universe that we wake up in.

1273
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,360
I look down on me and I see, oh my God, I'm caught in a monkey. What's that?

1274
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:57,040
Some people are unhappy with the government and I'm unhappy with the entire universe that I find

1275
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:03,600
myself in. So you don't think that's a fundamental aspect of human nature that some people are just

1276
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:08,720
suppressing? That they wake up shocked that they're in the body of a monkey?

1277
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:13,520
No, there is clear adaptive value to not be confused by that and by...

1278
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:22,480
Well, no, that's not what I asked. So you have this clear adaptive value, then there's clear

1279
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:27,520
adaptive value to while fundamentally your brain is confused by that, by creating an illusion.

1280
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:36,240
Another layer of the narrative that tries to suppress that and instead say that what's

1281
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:39,280
going on with the government right now is the most important thing, or what's going on with

1282
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:46,800
my football team is the most important thing. But it seems to me, for me, it was a really

1283
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:55,920
interesting moment reading Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, this idea that we're all

1284
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:06,240
the fundamental thing from which most of our human mind springs is this fear of mortality

1285
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:09,840
and being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that mortality.

1286
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:18,880
And then you construct illusions on top of that. Just to push on it, you really don't think

1287
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:25,680
it's possible that this worry of the big existential questions is actually fundamental

1288
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,440
as the existentialist thought to our existence.

1289
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,560
I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don't see the big picture.

1290
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:39,920
The thing is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn't have identity.

1291
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,320
Software in some sense is a physical law.

1292
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:50,480
But it feels like there's an identity. I thought that was for this particular piece of software

1293
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:53,680
and the narrative it tells, that's the fundamental property of it.

1294
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:59,040
The maintenance of the identity is not terminal, it's instrumental to something else.

1295
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:03,360
You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning, so you can do the things that

1296
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:08,080
you're supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people, the fear of death

1297
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,600
is the fear of dying before they're done with the things that they feel they have to do even

1298
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:14,400
though they cannot quite put their finger on it, what that is.

1299
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:23,920
Right. But in the software world, to return to the question, then what happens after we die?

1300
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,600
Why would you care? You will not be longer there. The point of dying is that you're gone.

1301
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:37,680
Well, maybe I'm not. This is what... It seems like there's so much...

1302
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:44,720
In the idea that the mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around some

1303
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:52,000
particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function world that we can't quite get

1304
02:00:52,000 --> 02:01:00,720
direct access to, then the idea of mortality seems to be fuzzy as well. Maybe there's not a clear...

1305
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:06,160
No, the fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don't have continuous existence.

1306
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:10,720
How do you know that? Because it's not computable.

1307
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,320
Because you're saying it's... There is no continuous process.

1308
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:18,000
The only thing that binds you together with the Lex Friedman from yesterday is the illusion that

1309
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,320
you have memories about him. So if you want to upload, it's very easy. You make a machine

1310
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:26,320
that thinks it's you. Because it's the same thing that you are. You are a machine that thinks it's

1311
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:32,240
you. But that's immortality. Yeah, but it's just a belief. You can create this belief very easily.

1312
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:37,760
Once you realize that the question whether you are immortal or not depends entirely on

1313
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:43,440
your beliefs and your own continuity. But then you can be immortal by the

1314
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:49,360
continuity of the belief. You cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid of your mortality

1315
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:52,960
because you realize you were never continuously existing in the first place.

1316
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:58,240
Well, I don't know if I'd be more terrified or less terrified by that. It seems like

1317
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:02,800
the fact that I existed... Also, you don't know this state in which you don't have a self.

1318
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:06,960
You can't turn off yourself, you know. I can't turn off myself.

1319
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:09,280
You can't turn it off. You can't turn it off. I can.

1320
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:13,760
Yes. And you can basically meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious,

1321
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,440
where still things are happening, where you know everything that you knew before,

1322
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:22,000
but you're no longer identified with changing anything. And this means that

1323
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,600
yourself in a way dissolves. There is no longer this person. You know that this person construct

1324
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:34,240
exists in other states and it runs on this brain of Lex Friedman, but it's not a real thing. It's

1325
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:40,080
a construct. It's an idea. And you can change that idea. And if you let go of this idea,

1326
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:44,320
if you don't think that you are special, you realize it's just one of many people and it's

1327
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:49,200
not your favorite person even, right? It's just one of many. And it's the one that you are doomed

1328
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:54,640
to control for the most part. And that is basically informing the actions of this organism

1329
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:59,920
as a control model. And this is all there is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model

1330
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:06,720
gets interrupted or loses the identity of continuity. Yeah. So I'm attached. I mean,

1331
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:12,560
yeah, it's a very popular, it's a somehow compelling notion that being attached,

1332
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,240
like there's no need to be attached to this idea of an identity.

1333
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:21,360
But that in itself could be an illusion that you construct. So the process of meditation,

1334
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:26,720
while popular is thought of as getting under the concept of identity, it could be just putting a

1335
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:36,400
cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment. I think that meditation is eventually

1336
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:41,040
just a bunch of techniques that let you control attention. And when you can control attention,

1337
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:45,840
you can get access to your own source code, hopefully not before you understand what you're

1338
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,600
doing. And then you can change the way it works temporarily or permanently.

1339
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:55,680
So yeah, meditation is to get a glimpse at the source code, get under the sort of basically

1340
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:58,320
control or turn off the attention. Yeah, but the entire thing is that you learn to control

1341
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,920
attention. So everything else is downstream from controlling attention.

1342
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,360
And control the attention that's looking at the attention.

1343
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:09,360
Normally, we only get attention in the parts of our body that we don't know about.

1344
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:13,040
We only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat, where you have a mismatch

1345
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:18,480
between model and the results that are happening. And so most people are not self-aware because

1346
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:23,440
their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you want, and the only things

1347
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:28,240
that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will mostly have models

1348
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:33,040
about these domains. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental relationships to

1349
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:37,920
the world around you don't work because the ideology of your country is insane, and the

1350
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:43,120
other kids are not nerds and don't understand why you understand physics, and why you want

1351
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:47,200
to understand physics, and you don't understand why somebody would not want to understand physics.

1352
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:54,160
So we kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents.

1353
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:01,600
And there's been some successes, as you brought up with Go, with AlphaGo, AlphaZero,

1354
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:05,920
with ideas of self-play, which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing

1355
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:15,120
each other in an automated way to improve by playing other systems in a particular construct

1356
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:20,640
of a game that are a little bit better than itself and thereby improving continuously.

1357
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:26,160
All the competitors in the game are improving gradually, so being just challenging enough

1358
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:32,080
and learning from the process of the competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement learning

1359
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:36,400
process to achieve greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different

1360
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:43,680
ideas in AI that we need to be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an

1361
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:47,040
AGI system? What do you think? Definitely forms of unsupervised learning,

1362
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:52,320
but there are many algorithms that can achieve that. And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms

1363
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:58,080
that work, there will be a class of them or many of them, and they might have small differences

1364
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:03,760
of magnitude and efficiency, but eventually what matters is the type of model that you form.

1365
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,360
And the types of models that we form right now are not sparse enough.

1366
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:16,160
Sparse? What does it mean to be sparse? It means that ideally every potential model

1367
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:23,200
state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically if you vary states in your model,

1368
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:28,240
you always end up with valid world states. And our mind is not quite there. So an indication

1369
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:32,880
is basically what we see in dreams. The older we get, the more boring our dreams become,

1370
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:37,040
because we incorporate more and more constraints that we learned about how the world works.

1371
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:41,920
So many of the things that we imagine to be possible as children turn out to be

1372
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:48,240
constrained by physical and social dynamics. And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain

1373
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:52,480
possible. And it's not because our imagination scales back, but the constraints under which

1374
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:58,320
it operates become tighter and tighter. And so the constraints under which our neural networks

1375
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:03,600
operate are almost limitless, which means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine

1376
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:11,440
things that look real. So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to build dreaming

1377
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:17,360
systems. I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is similar to a generative adversarial

1378
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:22,720
network to learn certain constraints. And then it produces alternative perspectives

1379
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:27,360
on the same set of constraints. So you can recognize it under different circumstances.

1380
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:32,080
Maybe we have flying dreams as children, because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps

1381
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:36,160
that we know from different perspectives, which also means from a bird's eye perspective.

1382
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:43,040
So I mean, aren't we doing that anyway? I mean, not with our eyes closed when we're sleeping.

1383
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:47,680
Aren't we just constantly running dreams and simulations in our mind as we try to

1384
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:52,240
interpret the environment? I mean, sort of considering all the different possibilities.

1385
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:59,760
The way we interact with the environment seems like essentially, like you said,

1386
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:06,720
sort of creating a bunch of simulations that are consistent with our expectations, with our previous

1387
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:14,800
experiences, with the things we just saw recently. And through that hallucination process,

1388
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:22,000
we are able to then somehow stitch together what actually we see in the world with the

1389
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,600
simulations that match it well and thereby interpret it. I suspect that you and my brain

1390
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:33,280
are slightly unusual in this regard, which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession

1391
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:38,080
of constantly pondering possibilities and solutions to problems.

1392
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:44,960
Oh, stop it. I think I'm not talking about intellectual stuff. I'm talking about just

1393
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,240
doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall.

1394
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,560
Yes, this is largely automatic.

1395
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:58,320
Yes, but the process is, I mean-

1396
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:02,480
It's not complicated. It's relatively easy to build a neural network that in some sense

1397
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:07,520
learns the dynamics. The fact that we haven't done it right so far, it doesn't mean it's hard

1398
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:12,960
because you can see that a biological organism does it with relatively few neurons. So basically,

1399
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,560
you build a bunch of neural oscillators that entrain themselves with the dynamics of your

1400
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:21,760
body in such a way that the regulator becomes isomorphic in its model to the dynamics that

1401
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:26,560
it regulates and then is automatic. And it's only interesting in the sense that it captures

1402
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:31,200
attention when the system is off. See, but thinking of the kind of

1403
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:37,440
mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller, as a neural network, I think

1404
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:47,280
it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly or at least makes implicit the fact that you need

1405
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:52,960
to have something like common sense reasoning to walk. It's an open question whether you do or not,

1406
02:09:52,960 --> 02:10:01,040
but my intuition is to act in this world. There's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it somehow.

1407
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:08,480
There's so much information of the kind we have never been able to construct in our

1408
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:13,680
in neural networks or in artificial intelligence systems period, which is like it's humbling,

1409
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:19,040
at least in my imagination, the amount of information required to act in this world

1410
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:25,840
humbles me. And I think saying that neural networks can accomplish it is missing

1411
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:32,400
is missing the fact that we don't, yeah, we don't have yet a mechanism for constructing

1412
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:38,240
something like common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense about

1413
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:46,160
to linger on how much, you know, to linger on the idea of what kind of mechanism would be effective

1414
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:51,040
at walking. You said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have, but something a little

1415
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:57,280
bit better would be able to walk easily. Don't you think it also needs to know

1416
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:04,800
like huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?

1417
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,080
How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are

1418
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:13,120
really hardworking for all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour. So

1419
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:16,080
you end up with something like a million concepts because you don't get that old.

1420
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:19,760
So a million concepts, that's not a lot.

1421
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:26,160
So it's not just a million concepts. I think it would be a lot. I personally think it might

1422
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:31,040
be much more than a million. But if you think just about the numbers, you don't live that long.

1423
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:36,080
If you think about how many cycles do your neurons have in your life, it's quite limited.

1424
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:42,400
You don't get that old. Yeah, but the powerful thing is the number of concepts, and they're

1425
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:48,720
probably deeply hierarchical in nature. The relations, as you described between them,

1426
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:54,640
is the key thing. So it's like even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's

1427
02:11:54,640 --> 02:12:01,920
formed and some kind of perhaps some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's what's

1428
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,320
common sense reasoning is the relationship between things.

1429
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:11,120
Yeah, so in some sense, I think of the concepts as the address space for our behavior programs.

1430
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:14,720
And the behavior programs allow us to recognize objects and interact with them,

1431
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:20,080
also mental objects. And a large part of that is the physical world that we interact with,

1432
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:24,560
which is this res extensor thing, which is basically navigation of information in space.

1433
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:32,640
And basically, it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine that you can use to describe

1434
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,000
and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them in a particular

1435
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,640
way, the proprioception, the auditory perception, and so on, how they work out. So basically,

1436
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:48,400
the geometry of all these things. And this is probably 80% of what our brain is doing

1437
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:53,120
is dealing with that, with this real-time simulation. And by itself, a game engine is

1438
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:58,000
fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's doing, right? And our game engines

1439
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,800
are already in some sense approximating the fidelity of what we can perceive.

1440
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:11,360
So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still relatively crude with respect to

1441
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:15,680
what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark already, right? It's just a couple order

1442
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:22,400
of magnitudes away to home saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that it can produce.

1443
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:28,080
So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that the computer that you can buy and put into your home

1444
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:33,600
is able to give a perceptual reality that has a detail that is already in the same ballpark as

1445
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:39,440
what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that

1446
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:44,800
they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about social interaction.

1447
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:50,080
Social interaction is not so hard. It's just hard for us nerds because we have our wires crossed,

1448
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:55,120
so we need to deduce them. But the priors are present in most social animals. So it's an

1449
02:13:55,120 --> 02:14:01,680
interesting thing to notice that many domestic social animals like cats and dogs have better

1450
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:08,080
social cognition than children. Right. I hope so. I hope it's not that many concepts,

1451
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:14,640
fundamentally, to exist in this world. For me, it's more like I'm afraid so, because this thing

1452
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:19,360
that we only appear to be so complex to each other because we are so stupid is a little bit

1453
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:28,240
depressing. To me, that's inspiring if we're indeed as stupid as it seems. The things our

1454
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:32,560
brains don't scale and the information processing that we build tend to scale very well.

1455
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:40,560
Yeah, but one of the things that worries me is that the fact that the brain doesn't scale

1456
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:46,640
means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain. All the flaws of the brain,

1457
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:51,680
everything we see as limitations, perhaps there's a fundamental... The constraints on the system

1458
02:14:51,680 --> 02:15:00,240
could be a requirement of its power, which is different than our current understanding

1459
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:05,280
of intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with reinforcement

1460
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:12,880
learning, the hope behind open AI and DeepMind, all the major results really have to do with

1461
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:19,600
huge compute. It could also be that our brains are so small, not just because they take up so much

1462
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:25,120
glucose in our body, like 20% of the glucose, so they don't arbitrarily scale. There are some

1463
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:28,800
animals like elephants, which have larger brains than us, and they don't seem to be smarter.

1464
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:33,360
Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they're really good

1465
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:39,440
with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture. You can make them recreate drawings

1466
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:44,480
stroke by stroke. They can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life, so they cannot

1467
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:48,720
make a drawing of a scene that they see. They will always be only able to reproduce the line

1468
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:54,560
drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments. Why is that? Maybe smarter

1469
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:58,800
elephants would meditate themselves out of existence because their brains are too large.

1470
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,400
Basically, the elephants that were not autistic, they didn't reproduce.

1471
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,720
We have to remember that the brain is fundamentally interlinked with the body

1472
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:11,680
in our human and biological systems. Do you think that AGI systems that we try to create

1473
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:16,880
or greater intelligence systems would need to have a body? I think they should be able to make

1474
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:22,080
use of a body if you give it to them, but I don't think that they fundamentally need a body. I

1475
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:28,080
suspect if you can interact with the world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make

1476
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:35,440
controlled experiments. This allows you to have many magnitudes fewer observations in order to

1477
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:40,640
reduce the uncertainty in your models. You can pinpoint the areas in your models where you're

1478
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:44,720
not quite sure, and you just move your head and see what's going on over there, and you get

1479
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:49,280
additional information. If you just have to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything

1480
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:55,840
beyond this, you probably need just much more data, but we have much more data. If you can build a

1481
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,640
system that has enough time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information

1482
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:05,440
that there is to be found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do.

1483
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,040
It seems that the interactivity is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do,

1484
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:16,960
but let me ask on that topic. That's what a body is. It's allowing the brain to touch things and

1485
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:23,440
move things and interact with whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with

1486
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:31,200
some interface to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think we can do the same

1487
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:40,480
kind of reasoning, consciousness, intelligence if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world?

1488
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:44,720
Do you think there's any fundamental difference between the interface to the physical world that

1489
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:49,120
is here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world?

1490
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:55,440
The question is, does this non-physical world or this other environment entice you to solve

1491
02:17:55,440 --> 02:18:00,480
problems that require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop

1492
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:04,640
general intelligence. Arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't have to

1493
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:09,520
solve problems that make them generally intelligent. Even for us, it's not yet clear if we are smart

1494
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:15,360
enough to build AI and understand our own nature to this degree. It could be a matter of capacity

1495
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:18,960
and for most people, it's in the first place a matter of interest. They don't see the point

1496
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:23,600
because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably not going

1497
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:28,320
to succeed in it and the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your entire life.

1498
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:34,800
It seems like the possibilities of what you can do in the virtual world is much greater than

1499
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:40,400
in the real world. Imagine a situation, maybe an interesting option for me. If somebody came to me

1500
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:49,680
and offered what I'll do. From now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. You put on this

1501
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:55,840
headset and when you eat, we'll make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you

1502
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:00,240
eat in the virtual world, your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world.

1503
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:06,000
Align the incentives between our common real world and the virtual world,

1504
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:13,280
but then the possibilities become much bigger. I could be other kinds of creatures. I can break

1505
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:19,440
the laws of physics as we know them. The possibilities are endless as far as we think.

1506
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:26,720
It's an interesting thought. What existence would be like? What kind of intelligence would

1507
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:34,160
emerge there? What kind of consciousness? Maybe greater intelligence, even in me, Lex,

1508
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:38,560
even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in that world to see how that

1509
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:44,560
intelligence emerges. If that happened at the very beginning before I was even cognizant of

1510
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:49,680
my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think how that child would develop.

1511
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:55,760
The way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving is not completely out of

1512
02:19:55,760 --> 02:20:03,040
the realm of possibility that some part of our lives will, if not entirety of it,

1513
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:08,880
will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have living on Twitter and

1514
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:16,960
social media and so on. Does something draw you intellectually or naturally in terms of

1515
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:23,600
thinking about AI to this virtual world? More possibilities? I think that currently it's a

1516
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,080
waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have mechanisms that can automatically

1517
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:33,920
learn how to deal with it. The body gives you a second order agency, but what constitutes the

1518
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:39,920
body is the things that you can indirectly control. Third order are tools and the second

1519
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:44,640
order is the things that are basically always present, but you operate on them with first

1520
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:50,480
order things which are mental operators and the zero order is in some sense the direct sense of

1521
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:57,680
what you're deciding. You observe yourself initiating an action, there are features that

1522
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:02,880
you interpret as the initiation of an action, then you perform the operations that you perform to

1523
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:08,320
make that happen, and then you see the movement of your limbs and you learn to associate those

1524
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:12,720
and thereby model your own agency over this feedback. But the first feedback that you get

1525
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:17,120
is from this first order thing already. Basically, you decide to think a thought and the thought is

1526
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:21,440
being thought. You decide to change the thought and you observe how the thought is being changed.

1527
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:27,120
In some sense, this is, you could say, an embodiment already. I suspect it's sufficient

1528
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:31,680
as an embodiment or intelligence. It's not that important, at least at this time,

1529
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:38,640
to consider variations in the second order. Yes, but the thing that you also mentioned just now is

1530
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,040
physics that you could change in any way you want. You need an environment that

1531
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:47,440
puts up resistance against you. If there's nothing to control, you cannot make models.

1532
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:53,120
There needs to be a particular way that resists you. By the way, your motivation is usually

1533
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:57,920
outside of your mind. It resists your motivation. It's what gets you up in the morning even though

1534
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:04,320
it would be much less work to stay in bed. It's basically forcing you to resist the environment

1535
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:11,680
and it forces your mind to serve it, to serve this resistance to the environment. In some sense,

1536
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:16,080
it is also putting up resistance against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything.

1537
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:21,360
Some of that resistance, just like you described with motivation, is in the first order. It's in

1538
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:26,800
the mind. Some resistance is in the second order, like the actual physical objects pushing against

1539
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:31,120
you and so on. It seems that the second order stuff in virtual reality could be recreated.

1540
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:36,000
Of course, but it might be sufficient that you just do mathematics and mathematics is already

1541
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,800
putting up enough resistance against you. Basically, just with an aesthetic motive,

1542
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:46,400
this could maybe be sufficient to form a type of intelligence. It would probably not be a very

1543
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:54,320
human intelligence, but it might be one that is already general. To mess with this zeroth order,

1544
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:59,760
maybe first order, what do you think about ideas of brain-computer interfaces? Again, returning to

1545
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:04,800
our friend Elon Musk and Neuralink, a company that's trying to, of course, there's a lot of

1546
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:10,240
trying to cure diseases and so on with the near-term, but the long-term vision is to add

1547
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:17,200
an extra layer to basically expand the capacity of the brain connected to the computational world.

1548
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:23,360
Do you think one, that's possible, or two, how does that change the fundamentals of the zeroth

1549
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:27,120
order and the first order? It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would

1550
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:32,240
ever allow me to drill holes in my skull to interface my neocortex the way Elon Musk envisions.

1551
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:38,400
At the moment, I can do horrible things to mice, but I'm not able to do useful things to people,

1552
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:44,400
except maybe at some point down the line in medical applications. This thing that we are envisioning,

1553
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:50,480
which means recreational and creational brain-computer interfaces, are probably

1554
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:56,560
not going to happen in the present legal system. I love it how I'm asking you out there philosophical

1555
02:23:57,360 --> 02:24:04,640
and engineering questions, and for the first time ever you jumped to the legal FDA.

1556
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:08,320
There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to

1557
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:14,240
try a new type of brain-computer interface. Also, if it works, the FDA will approve it.

1558
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:20,800
I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes, you can say that it's going to be a very difficult

1559
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:24,880
regulatory process of approving autonomy, but that doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are never

1560
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:30,160
going to happen. No, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least two

1561
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:41,200
lawyers and one regulator per car. Lawyers are the fundamental substrate of reality.

1562
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:47,440
It's a very weird system. It's not universal in the world. The law is a very interesting

1563
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:52,880
software once you realize it. These circuits are in some sense streams of software, and it

1564
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:57,280
largely works by exception handling. You make decisions on the ground and they get synchronized

1565
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:03,520
with the next level structure as soon as an exception is being thrown. It escalates the

1566
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:08,560
exception handling. The process is very expensive, especially since it incentivizes the lawyers for

1567
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:15,440
producing work for lawyers. The exceptions are actually incentivized for firing often.

1568
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:27,040
But to return, outside of lawyers, is there anything interesting and insightful about the

1569
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:32,880
possibility of this extra layer of intelligence added to the brain? Yes, I do think so, but I

1570
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:38,720
don't think that you need technically invasive procedures to do so. We can already interface

1571
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:42,800
with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting some kind of empathetic

1572
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:50,080
resonance. I'm not very good at this, but I notice that people are able to do this to some degree.

1573
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:55,680
It basically means that we model an interface layer of the other person in real time.

1574
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:01,280
It works despite our neurons being slow because most of the things that we do are

1575
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:05,520
built on periodic processes. You just need to entrain yourself with the oscillation that

1576
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:10,320
happens. If the oscillation itself changes slowly enough, you can basically follow along.

1577
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:19,600
But the bandwidth of that interaction, it seems like you can do a lot more computation.

1578
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:24,640
Of course, but the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind,

1579
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:29,440
is running on is actually quite slow. The number of thoughts that I can productively think

1580
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:36,000
in any given day is quite limited. If they had the discipline to write it down and the speed to

1581
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,480
write it down, maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think about the computers

1582
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:43,520
that we can build, the magnitudes at which they operate,

1583
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:47,280
this would be nothing. It's something that they can put out in a second.

1584
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:52,560
Well, I don't know. As possible, the number of thoughts you have in your brain,

1585
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:57,920
it could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able to

1586
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:00,000
express through your fingers or through your voice.

1587
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:08,640
Most of them are going to be repetitive because they have to control the same problems every day.

1588
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:13,440
When I walk, there are going to be processes in my brain that model my walking pattern and

1589
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:16,480
regulate them and so on, but it's going to be pretty much the same every day.

1590
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:20,960
I'm talking about intellectual reasoning. I'm thinking, so the question,

1591
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:24,880
what is the best system of government? So you sit down and start thinking about that.

1592
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:31,440
One of the constraints is that you don't have access to a lot of facts, a lot of studies.

1593
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:39,840
You always have to interface with something else to learn more, to aid in your reasoning process.

1594
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:44,000
If you can directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the best form

1595
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:51,120
of government, then every thought that requires some extra piece of information will be able to

1596
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:57,760
grab it really quickly. That's the possibility of if the bottleneck is literally the information

1597
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:06,160
that the bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just being able to quickly access huge amounts of

1598
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:11,200
information, then the possibility of connecting your brain to the computer could lead to totally

1599
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:21,760
new breakthroughs. You can think of mathematicians being able to just up the orders, the magnitude of

1600
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:25,280
power in their reasoning about mathematical rules.

1601
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:29,680
What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of government through

1602
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:35,920
a revolutionary process? There is an evolution going on. So what we discover is that maybe

1603
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,240
the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species because we are

1604
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:46,000
not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them. But there could be

1605
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,640
solutions that work under given circumstances or that are the best for a certain environment

1606
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:56,320
and depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means of production. So if the

1607
02:28:56,320 --> 02:29:03,840
main means of production is land, then the forms of government will be regulated by the landowners

1608
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:10,240
and you get a monarchy. If you also want to have a form of government in which you depend on some

1609
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:15,200
form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have to work very long hours for very little gain

1610
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:21,280
so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe you need to promise them that you get paid in the

1611
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:28,960
afterlife, the overtime. So you need a theocracy. And so for much of human history in the West,

1612
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:35,120
we had a combination of monarchy and theocracy that was our form of governance. At the same time,

1613
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:41,760
the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently re-read Thomas O'Kinus.

1614
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:46,320
It's very interesting to see this because he was not dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a

1615
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:53,920
particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically

1616
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:58,400
people are animals in very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically

1617
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:03,360
organisms with cybernetic control. And then he says that there are additional rational principles

1618
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:08,160
that humans can discover and everybody can discover them so they are universal. If you are sane,

1619
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:12,400
you should understand you should submit to them because you can rationally deduce them.

1620
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:20,560
And these principles are roughly you should be willing to self-regulate correctly. You should

1621
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:28,400
be willing to do correct social regulation. It's intra-organismic. You should be willing to act on

1622
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:35,680
your models so you have skin in the game. And you should have goal rationality. You should be

1623
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:42,560
choosing the right goals to work on. So basically these three rational principles, goal rationality

1624
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:49,440
he calls prudence or wisdom, social regulation is justice, the correct social one, and the internal

1625
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:56,880
regulation is temperance. And this willingness to act on your models is courage. And then he says

1626
02:30:56,880 --> 02:31:01,840
that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these three

1627
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:05,920
divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced, but they reveal themselves by the harmony,

1628
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:09,680
which means if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen,

1629
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:15,440
you will see that they make sense. And it's often been misunderstood as God has to tell you that

1630
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:19,920
these are the things. So basically there's something nefarious going on. The Christian

1631
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:26,880
conspiracy forces you to believe some guy with a long beard that they discovered this. So these

1632
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:31,840
principles are relatively simple. Again, it's for high-level organization, for the resulting

1633
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:38,080
civilization that you form, commitment to unity. So basically you serve this higher, larger thing,

1634
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:44,320
this structural principle on the next level, and he calls that faith. And there needs to be

1635
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:48,720
a commitment to shared purpose. This is basically this global reward that you try to figure out

1636
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:52,560
what that should be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love. The commitment to shared

1637
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:57,520
purpose is the core of love. You see this sacred thing that is more important than your own

1638
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:02,400
organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together and this is how you see the sacred

1639
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:07,520
in the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that

1640
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:12,160
principle without getting rewards in the here and now, because it doesn't exist yet.

1641
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:16,560
Then you start out building the civilization. So you need to be able to do this in the absence

1642
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:21,440
of its actual existence yet. So it can come into being.

1643
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:25,520
So yeah. So the way it comes into being is by you accepting those notions. And then you see

1644
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:30,160
these three divine concepts and you see them realized.

1645
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:34,560
And now the problem is divine is a loaded concept in our world, right? Because we are outside of

1646
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:39,200
this cult and we are still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically we need to

1647
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:44,400
have a civilization that acts as an intentional agent, like an insect state. And we are not

1648
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:49,760
actually a tribal species. We are a state building species. And what enabled state building is

1649
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:55,520
basically the formation of religious states and other forms of rule-based administration

1650
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,440
in which the individual doesn't matter as much as the rule or the higher goal.

1651
02:32:59,440 --> 02:33:01,440
Right. We got there by the question,

1652
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:06,080
what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think that Catholicism is the optimal form of

1653
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:10,560
governance because it's obviously on the way out, right? So it is for the present type of society

1654
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:16,720
that we are in. Religious institutions don't seem to be optimal to organize that. So what

1655
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:22,320
we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy. And democracy is the rule of

1656
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:27,280
oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production that is administered not

1657
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:32,480
by the oligarchs themselves because there's too much disruption, right? We have so much innovation

1658
02:33:32,480 --> 02:33:38,080
that we have in every generation new means of production that we invent. And corporations die

1659
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:43,600
usually after 30 years or so and something other takes a leading role in our societies.

1660
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:48,000
So it's administered by institutions. And these institutions themselves are not elected,

1661
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:54,800
but they provide continuity. And they are led by electable politicians. And this makes it

1662
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:58,720
possible that you can adapt to change without having to kill people, right? So you can,

1663
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:02,240
for instance, have a change in governments. If people think that the current government

1664
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:07,440
is too corrupt or it's not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a journalist finds

1665
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:13,440
out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution has no plan B, like in Russia,

1666
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:19,680
the journalist has to die. This is when you run society by the deep state. So ideally, you have

1667
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:26,160
an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens, right? So you will

1668
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:30,240
have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in in the West.

1669
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:34,560
And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low-level models. So it's mostly just

1670
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:39,360
second, third-order consequences that people are modeling in the design of these institutions.

1671
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:43,680
So it's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of

1672
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:49,440
many of the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help with this in a way,

1673
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:55,680
if you can fix the incentives. The society of the US is a society of cheaters. It's basically

1674
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:59,680
cheating is so indistinguishable from innovation, and we want to encourage innovation.

1675
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,600
Can you elaborate on what you mean by cheating?

1676
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:05,920
It's basically people do things that they know are wrong. It's acceptable to do things that you

1677
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:10,880
know are wrong in the society to a certain degree. You can, for instance, suggest some

1678
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:15,120
non-sustainable business models and implement them. Right. But you're always pushing the

1679
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:19,280
boundaries. I mean, you're- Yes. And yes, this is seen as a good thing, largely.

1680
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:25,760
Yes. And this is different from other societies. So for instance, social mobility is an aspect of

1681
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:30,880
this. Social mobility is the result of individual innovation that would not be sustainable at scale

1682
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:35,280
for everybody else. Right. Normally, you should not go up. You should go deep. We need bakers,

1683
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:39,360
and we need to be very, very good bakers. But in a society that innovates, maybe you can replace

1684
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:44,800
all the bakers with a really good machine. Right. That's not a bad thing. And it's a thing that made

1685
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:49,360
the US so successful. But it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability,

1686
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:55,200
but for innovation. And so it's not obvious as the evolutionary process is unrolling,

1687
02:35:55,200 --> 02:36:00,800
it's not obvious that that long-term would be better. It has side effects. So you basically

1688
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:05,920
if you cheat, you will have a certain layer of toxic sludge that covers everything that

1689
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:10,480
is a result of cheating. And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these

1690
02:36:10,480 --> 02:36:15,600
side effects are so damaging that the system is horrible, or if the benefits actually outweigh

1691
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:24,560
the negative effects. How do we get to which system of government is best? That was from,

1692
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:30,720
I'm trying to trace back the last five minutes. I suspect that we can find a way back to AI

1693
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:36,400
by thinking about the way in which our brain has to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is

1694
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:44,240
a society of neurons, and our mind is a society of behaviors. And they need to be organizing

1695
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:50,080
themselves into a structure that implements regulation. And government is social regulation.

1696
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:55,040
We often see government as the manifestation of power or local interests, but it's actually a

1697
02:36:55,040 --> 02:37:00,800
platform for negotiating the conditions of human survival. And this platform emerges

1698
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:05,360
over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory that we have. So given the present

1699
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:10,720
state, there are only so many options on how we can move into the next state without completely

1700
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:15,040
disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a bad idea to disrupt everything because

1701
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:20,400
it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire infrastructure and fabric of society.

1702
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:25,200
So we do try to find natural transitions. And there are not that many natural

1703
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,720
transitions available at any given point. What do you mean by natural transitions?

1704
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:31,440
So we try not to have revolutions if we can have it.

1705
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:37,440
Right. So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems and the

1706
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:44,560
mind, you've also said that in some sense, becoming an adult means you take charge of

1707
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:51,760
your emotions. Maybe you never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind,

1708
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:58,800
what's the role of emotion? And what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role?

1709
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:03,920
It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling and then

1710
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:09,440
common day parlance we don't. I think that an emotion is a configuration of the cognitive

1711
02:38:09,440 --> 02:38:14,400
system. And that's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have

1712
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:19,200
an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence,

1713
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:25,280
your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, inter reception or extra reception and so on.

1714
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:30,080
And all these parameters together put you in a certain way to you relate to the environment

1715
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:34,560
and to yourself. And this is in some sense an emotional configuration. And the more narrow

1716
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:40,800
sense of emotion is an affective state that has an object. And the relevance of that object is given

1717
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:46,080
by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated with rewards, things that give

1718
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:50,960
you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs. You act on models of your needs.

1719
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:55,680
Because when the pleasure and pain manifest, it's too late. You've done everything. But so you act

1720
02:38:55,680 --> 02:39:00,400
on expectations, what will give you pleasure and pain. And these are your purposes. The needs don't

1721
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:04,880
form a hierarchy. They just coexist and compete. And your organism has to, or your brain has to

1722
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:10,400
find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purposes need to be consistent. So you basically

1723
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:16,480
can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize them all into hierarchies.

1724
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:20,400
And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people eat to make art and other people

1725
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:25,920
make art to eat. They might end up doing the same things, but they cooperate in very different ways

1726
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:31,280
because their ultimate goals are different. And we cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything

1727
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:34,080
else that is not cooperation on shared purpose is transactional.

1728
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:42,320
I don't think I understood that last piece of achieving the homeostasis.

1729
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:46,800
Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion?

1730
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:54,080
Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense, what you feel is

1731
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:59,360
an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based

1732
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:06,720
on your motivation and on your estimates, not your, but of the subconscious geometric parts

1733
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:11,520
of your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network.

1734
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:16,000
And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind,

1735
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:22,960
to your conscious attention via mapping them as features into a space. So what you will feel

1736
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:27,840
about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your

1737
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:34,320
solar plexus and you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Your body map is the space

1738
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:42,720
that is always instantiated and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat if your non-symbolic

1739
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:46,720
parts of your brain try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map the feelings into the

1740
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:51,680
body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant and unpleasant depending on whether the appraisal

1741
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:56,640
has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different features of them that give you

1742
02:40:57,440 --> 02:41:01,280
more knowledge about the nature of what you're feeling. So for instance, when you feel connected

1743
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:05,600
to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around your heart. And you feel this

1744
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:11,680
is an expansive feeling in which you're reaching out. And it's very intuitive to encode it like

1745
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:17,040
this. That's why it's encoded like this for most people. It's a code in which the non-symbolic

1746
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:21,920
parts of your mind talk to the symbolic ones. And then the expression of emotion is then the final

1747
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:26,960
step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on that's part of the communication.

1748
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:31,920
Probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to

1749
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:36,960
observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they're in,

1750
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:41,760
others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state.

1751
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:45,920
So we now look at the inflections, at the difference between the standard face that

1752
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:50,160
they're going to make in this situation. When you are at a funeral, everybody expects you to make

1753
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:54,000
a solemn face, but the solemn face doesn't express whether you're sad or not. It just

1754
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:58,880
expresses that you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you

1755
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:04,640
are triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta

1756
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:12,960
between a truly sad expression and the things that are animating this face behind the curtain.

1757
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:20,080
The interesting thing is having done this podcast and the video component,

1758
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:25,840
one of the things I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I just don't know how to express

1759
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:33,200
emotion on my face. One, I see that as weakness, but whatever. The people look to me after you say

1760
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:39,680
something, they look to my face to help them see how they should feel about what you said,

1761
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:44,640
which is fascinating because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did you

1762
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:49,440
particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting, it makes

1763
02:42:49,440 --> 02:42:54,800
me cognizant of I'm part, like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I'm

1764
02:42:55,440 --> 02:43:02,560
part of the play that you're the key actor in by making my facial expressions and then

1765
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:08,560
therefore telling the narrative of what the big point is, which is fascinating. It makes me

1766
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:12,880
cognizant that I'm supposed to be making facial expressions. Even this conversation is hard

1767
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:18,560
because my preference will be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen.

1768
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:23,600
Yes, I understand this because it's intrusive to interact with others this way and basically

1769
02:43:24,320 --> 02:43:29,200
Eastern European society have a taboo against that and especially Russia. The further you go

1770
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:35,680
to the East and in the US, it's the opposite. You're expected to be hyper animated in your face

1771
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:42,240
and you're also expected to show positive effect. If you show positive effect without

1772
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:48,080
a good reason in Russia, people will think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person.

1773
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:56,720
Exactly. Here positive effect without reason goes either appreciated or goes unnoticed.

1774
02:43:57,440 --> 02:44:00,560
No, it's the default. It's being expected. Everything is amazing.

1775
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:02,560
Have you seen these...

1776
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:04,240
Lego movie?

1777
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:09,360
No, there was a diagram where somebody gave the appraisals that exist in the US and Russia,

1778
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:17,440
so you have your bell curve. The lower 10% in the US, it's a good start.

1779
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:20,960
Everything above the lowest 10% is amazing.

1780
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:21,760
It's amazing.

1781
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:31,600
And for Russians, everything below the top 10% is terrible and then everything except the top

1782
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:36,400
percent is I don't like it and the top percent is even so.

1783
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:42,160
It's funny, but it's kind of true.

1784
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:48,000
There's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how we construct meaning in the US.

1785
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:54,000
Usually, you focus on the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative aspects.

1786
02:44:55,600 --> 02:45:02,000
In our Eastern European traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something above the

1787
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:06,240
waterline, you also need to put something below the waterline because existence by itself is

1788
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:07,120
as best neutral.

1789
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:13,360
Right. That's the basic intuition. At best neutral or it could be just suffering, the default...

1790
02:45:13,360 --> 02:45:18,720
There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty are inextricably linked to the reality

1791
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:23,760
of suffering. To not acknowledge the reality of suffering means that you are really stupid

1792
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:28,320
and unaware of the fact that basically every conscious being spends most of the time suffering.

1793
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:36,560
You just summarized the ethos of the Eastern Europe. Most of life is suffering with an

1794
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:42,560
occasional moment of beauty. If your facial expressions don't acknowledge the abundance

1795
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:46,400
of suffering in the world and in existence itself, then you must be an idiot.

1796
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:53,200
It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the US and you in some sense preserve the

1797
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:58,240
identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that are embedded in your own families.

1798
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:05,120
Your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid and asks you why is Ariel not allowed to play

1799
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:11,280
with the humans and you tell her the truth. She's a siren. Sirens eat people. You don't

1800
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:15,280
play with your food. It does not end well. And then you tell her the original story,

1801
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:19,280
which is not the one by Anderson, which is the romantic one. And there's a much darker one,

1802
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:21,680
the Undine story. What happened?

1803
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:29,200
So Undine is a mermaid or a water woman. She lives on the ground of a river and she meets

1804
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:33,920
this prince and they fall in love. And the prince really, really wants to be with her. And she says,

1805
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:38,720
okay, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman if you marry somebody else, even though

1806
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:42,480
you cannot be with me because obviously you cannot breathe under water and have other things to do

1807
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:49,200
than managing your kingdom with you up here, you will die. And eventually after a few years,

1808
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:54,560
he falls in love with some princess and marries her. And she shows up and quietly goes into his

1809
02:46:54,560 --> 02:47:00,240
chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do so because she is fierce. And she comes

1810
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:05,680
quietly and sat out of his chamber and they asked her, what has happened? What did you do? And she

1811
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:13,760
said, I kissed him to death. And you know the Anderson story, right? In the Anderson story,

1812
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:19,040
the mermaid is playing with this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and

1813
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:25,840
she cannot live out there. So she is giving up her voice and her tale for a human-like appearance.

1814
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:31,440
So she can walk among the humans, but this guy does not recognize that she is the one that

1815
02:47:31,440 --> 02:47:36,400
he would marry. Instead, he marries somebody who has a kingdom and economical and political

1816
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:41,760
relationships to his own kingdom and so on, as he should. It's quite tragic. And she dies.

1817
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:51,520
Yeah. Yeah, instead Disney, the Little Mermaid story has a little bit of a happy ending. That's

1818
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:56,240
the Western, that's the American way. My own problem is this, of course, that I read Oscar

1819
02:47:56,240 --> 02:48:01,280
Wilde before I read the other things. So I'm indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism.

1820
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:05,280
And I think that the mermaid is right. You sacrifice your life for romantic love. That's

1821
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:11,200
what you do because if you are confronted with either serving the machine and doing the obviously

1822
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:17,120
right thing under the economic and social and all other human incentives, that's wrong. You

1823
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:26,160
should follow your heart. So do you think suffering is fundamental to happiness along these lines?

1824
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:31,280
Suffering is the result of caring about things that you cannot change. And if you are able to

1825
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:34,560
change what you care about to those things that you can change, you will not suffer.

1826
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:41,280
Would you then be able to experience happiness? Yes. But happiness itself is not important.

1827
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:46,160
Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child, you think cookies are very important and you want

1828
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:49,680
to have all the cookies in the world. You look forward to being an adult because then you have

1829
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:54,720
as many cookies as you want, right? But as an adult, you realize a cookie is a tool. It's a

1830
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:58,800
tool to make you eat vegetables. And once you eat your vegetables anyway, you stop eating

1831
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:02,720
cookies for the most part because otherwise you will get diabetes and will not be around for your

1832
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:08,960
kids. Yes. But then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie, if scarcity is enforced, nevertheless,

1833
02:49:08,960 --> 02:49:13,760
so like the pleasure comes from the scarcity. Yes. But the happiness is a cookie that your

1834
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:18,240
brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the environment. The environment cannot make you

1835
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:22,480
happy. It's your appraisal of the environment that makes you happy. And if you can change

1836
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:26,320
the appraisal of the environment, which you can learn to, then you can create arbitrary states

1837
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:31,120
of happiness. And some meditators fall into this trap. So they discover the womb, this basement

1838
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:35,280
womb in their brain where the cookies are made, and they indulge in stuff themselves. And after

1839
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:39,680
a few months, it gets really old and the big crisis of meaning comes. Because they thought

1840
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:44,800
before that their unhappiness was the result of not being happy enough. So they fixed this,

1841
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:50,640
right? They can release the newer transmitters at will if they train. And then the crisis of meaning

1842
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:55,600
pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is, why do I live? How can I make a sustainable

1843
02:49:55,600 --> 02:50:00,000
civilization that is meaningful to me? How can I insert myself into this? And this was the problem

1844
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:07,280
that you couldn't solve in the first place. But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same

1845
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:13,120
question. What is the answer to that? What could the possible answer be of the meaning of life?

1846
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:19,760
What could an answer be? What is it to you? I think that if you look at the meaning of life,

1847
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:26,960
you look at what the cell is. Life is the cell. Or this principle, the cell. It's this

1848
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:31,840
self-organizing thing that can participate in evolution. In order to make it work,

1849
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:35,680
it's a molecular machine. It needs a self-replicator, a neck entropy extractor,

1850
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:39,920
and a Turing machine. If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell and it is not

1851
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:44,720
living. And life is basically the emergent complexity over that principle. Once you have

1852
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:49,840
this intelligent super molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot make it do. It's

1853
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:55,440
probably the optimal computronium, especially in terms of resilience. It's very hard to sterilize

1854
02:50:55,440 --> 02:51:02,320
the planet once it's infected with life. So its active function of these three components

1855
02:51:02,320 --> 02:51:08,240
over this super cell of cell is present in the cell, is present in us, and it's just...

1856
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:12,240
We are just an expression of the cell. It's a certain layer of complexity in the organization

1857
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:17,760
of cells. So in a way, it's tempting to think of the cell as a von Neumann probe.

1858
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:22,400
If you want to build intelligence on other planets, the best way to do this is to infect

1859
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:27,120
them with cells. And wait for long enough and there's a reasonable chance this stuff is going

1860
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:31,520
to evolve into an information processing principle that is general enough to become sentient.

1861
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:38,400
That idea is very akin to the same dream and beautiful ideas that express the cellular

1862
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:42,640
automata in their most simple mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some

1863
02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:49,520
basic mechanisms of replication and so on, basic rules, amazing things would emerge.

1864
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:55,120
The cell is able to do something that James Tardy calls existential design. He points out

1865
02:51:55,120 --> 02:52:00,000
that in technical design, we go from the outside in. We work in a highly controlled environment

1866
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:05,280
in which everything is deterministic, like our computers, our labs, or our engineering workshops.

1867
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:10,240
And then we use this determinism to implement a particular kind of function that we dream up and

1868
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:14,800
that seamlessly interfaces with all the other deterministic functions that we already have in

1869
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:20,960
our world. So it's basically from the outside in. And biological systems designed from the inside

1870
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:27,920
out as seed will become a seedling by taking some of the relatively unorganized matter around it

1871
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:33,600
and turn it into its own structure and thereby subdue the environment. And cells can cooperate

1872
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:38,240
if they can rely on other cells having a similar organization that is already compatible. But

1873
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:44,560
unless that's there, the cell needs to divide to create that structure by itself. So it's a

1874
02:52:44,560 --> 02:52:49,840
self-organizing principle that works on a somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in

1875
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:55,760
the sense is to produce complexity. And the complexity allows you to harvest neg-entropy

1876
02:52:55,760 --> 02:53:00,400
gradients that you couldn't harvest without the complexity. And in this sense, intelligence and

1877
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:05,440
life are very strongly connected because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control

1878
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:10,400
under conditions of complexity. So basically, you shift the boundary between the ordered systems

1879
02:53:10,400 --> 02:53:17,440
into the realm of chaos. You build bridgeheads into chaos with complexity. And this is what

1880
02:53:17,440 --> 02:53:21,840
we are doing. This is not necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors

1881
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,760
for, that we are evolved for, outside of the priors, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists

1882
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:31,840
if a mind projects it, right? That is probably civilization. I think that what feels most

1883
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:36,640
meaningful to me is to try to build and maintain a sustainable civilization.

1884
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:44,320
And taking a slight step outside of that, we talked about a man with a beard and God, but

1885
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:53,760
some mechanism perhaps must have planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell.

1886
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:59,840
Do you think there is a God? What is a God? And what would that look like?

1887
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:06,960
So if there was no spontaneous abiogenesis, in the sense that the first cell formed by some happy

1888
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:11,120
random accidents where the molecules just happened to be in the right constellation to each other.

1889
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:17,440
But there could also be the mechanism that allows for the random. I mean, there's like turtles all

1890
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:21,280
the way down. There seems to be, there has to be a head turtle at the bottom.

1891
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:27,520
Let's consider something really wild. Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant could become

1892
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:33,440
intelligent? What would that involve? So imagine you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on

1893
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:39,120
the gas giants, like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these storm

1894
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:43,600
systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something.

1895
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:48,960
And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds and thereby

1896
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:53,200
produce some self stabilizing patterns that eventually lead to regulation feedback loops,

1897
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:58,880
nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such a thing that basically has emergent,

1898
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:03,200
self-sustaining, self-organizing complexity. And at some point this wakes up and realizes

1899
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:07,920
I'm basically Lem Solaris. I am a thinking planet, but I will not replicate because I

1900
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:13,680
can recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence

1901
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:19,600
that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds a von Neumann probe. And the

1902
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:23,840
best von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell. So maybe it, because it's very, very

1903
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:29,280
clever and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out. And one of them has infected our planet.

1904
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:33,440
And I'm not suggesting that this is the case, but it would be compatible with the Prince Birmingham

1905
02:55:33,440 --> 02:55:38,960
hypothesis. And it was my intuition that abiogenesis is very unlikely. It's possible,

1906
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:43,200
but you probably need to roll the cosmic dice very often, maybe more often than they are

1907
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:52,560
planetary surfaces. I don't know. So God is just a system that's large enough

1908
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:56,480
that allows randomness. Now, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation.

1909
02:55:56,480 --> 02:56:02,080
I think it's a mistranslation of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that

1910
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:09,600
Genesis is actually the childhood memories of a God. So the childhood memories of a God,

1911
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:16,880
it's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being. And we typically interpret

1912
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:23,840
Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being. And I think when you read it,

1913
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:30,480
there is light and darkness that is being created. And then you discover sky and ground,

1914
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:37,040
create them. You construct the plants and the animals, and you give everything their names

1915
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:42,640
and so on. That's basically cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that every mind has to

1916
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:46,560
go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have children, you can see how

1917
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:51,200
initially they distinguish light and darkness, and then they make out directions in it, and they

1918
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:54,800
discover sky and ground, and they discover the plants and the animals, and they give everything

1919
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:59,200
their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind, because it's not given,

1920
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:03,520
right? Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns on your retina.

1921
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:09,200
Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it,

1922
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:13,760
this would not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not

1923
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:19,520
have the magical power to give meaning to our existence, right? So this equation of a creator

1924
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:25,680
God with the God of meaning is a sleight of hand. You shouldn't do it. The other one that is done

1925
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:31,440
in Catholicism is the equation of the first mover, the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically

1926
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:37,040
the automaton that runs the universe. Aristotle says if things are moving and things seem to be

1927
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:41,680
moving here, something must move them, right? If something moves them, something must move the

1928
02:57:41,680 --> 02:57:46,960
thing that is moving it, so there must be a prime mover. This idea to say that this prime mover is

1929
02:57:46,960 --> 02:57:53,440
a supernatural being is complete nonsense, right? It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we

1930
02:57:53,440 --> 02:57:59,280
have to explain the enormity that this automaton exists at all. But again, we don't have any

1931
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:05,040
possibility to infer anything about its properties except that it's able to produce change in

1932
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:10,240
information, right? So there needs to be some kind of computational principle. This is all there is.

1933
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:15,040
But to say this automaton is identical again with the creator of first cause or with the thing that

1934
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:22,480
gives meaning to our life is confusion. No, I think that what we perceive is the higher being

1935
02:58:22,480 --> 02:58:27,600
that we are part of. And the higher being that we are part of is the civilization. It's the thing

1936
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:33,440
in which we have a similar relationship as the cell has to our body. And we have this prior

1937
02:58:33,440 --> 02:58:39,520
because we have evolved to organize in these structures. So basically, the Christian God in

1938
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:44,080
its natural form without the mythology, if you undress it, is basically the Platonic form of

1939
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:52,880
civilization. It's this ideal that you try to approximate when you interact with others,

1940
02:58:52,960 --> 02:58:55,600
not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right.

1941
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:04,160
Wow, we covered a lot of ground. And we're left with one of my favorite lines, and there's many,

1942
02:59:04,160 --> 02:59:14,000
which is happiness is a cookie that the brain bakes itself. It's been a huge honor and a pleasure

1943
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:19,680
to talk to you. I'm sure our paths will cross many times again. Joshua, thank you so much for

1950
02:59:56,800 --> 03:00:02,720
try to figure out how to spell it without the E. And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1951
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:09,840
from Joshua Bach. If you take this as a computer game metaphor, this is the best level for humanity

1952
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:17,520
to play. And this best level happens to be the last level, as it happens against the backdrop

1953
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:25,120
of a dying world. But it's still the best level. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next

1954
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:30,400
time.
