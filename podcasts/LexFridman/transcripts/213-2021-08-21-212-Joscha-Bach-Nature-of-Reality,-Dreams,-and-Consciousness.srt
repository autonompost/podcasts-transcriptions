00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
The following is a conversation with Josje Bach,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
his second time on the podcast.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,560
Josje is one of the most fascinating minds in the world

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,640
exploring the nature of intelligence,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,520
cognition, computation, and consciousness.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,720

Their links are in the description.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,160
As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,720
no ads in the middle.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,120
I try to make these interesting,

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,300
so hopefully you don't skip, but if you do,

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,880
please still check out the sponsors in the description.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,400
It's the best way to support this podcast.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,600
I use their stuff and enjoy it, so maybe you will too.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
This show is brought to you by Coinbase,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
which is a trusted and easy to use platform

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,220
to buy, sell, and spend cryptocurrency.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,460
I use it and love it.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,980
You can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Dogecoin,

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,100
the list goes on.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,620
All the most popular digital currencies.

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,940
It's the place I recommend to people all the time

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,820
if they're kind of curious about cryptocurrency,

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,660
so Coinbase just makes it super easy

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,940
to buy whatever cryptocurrency you want.

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,140
I think cryptocurrency space is very exciting,

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,820
so if you're missing out on it,

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,620
I think some percent of your portfolio

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,200
should be in cryptocurrency.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,840
Investing in a little bit of cryptocurrency,

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,840
I think puts your money where your mind is,

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,960
so it forces you to kind of explore the space more and more.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,200
If you find it interesting, you can always, of course,

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,440
invest more, but I do recommend people at least try it out.

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,680
Anyway, go to Coinbase.com slash Lex for a limited time.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,860
New users can get $5 and free Bitcoin

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,860
when you, they sign up at Coinbase.com slash Lex.

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,580
That's Coinbase.com slash Lex.

40
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,700
This show is brought to you by Codecademy,

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,460
the website I highly recommend you go to

42
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,720
if you want to learn how to code.

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,180
It doesn't matter if you're totally new

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,580
or somewhat experienced, there's courses there for you.

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,660
For the beginner, for the intermediate, for the advanced,

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,380
I recommend you sign up

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,180
and take their Learn Python 3 course.

48
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,100
They say it takes 25 hours to complete,

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,420
but it is so clear, accessible, even fun,

50
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,260
that I think it actually will take less time,

51
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,580
but even if it takes that long, it'll just fly by.

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,300
It gives you the most important basics

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,820
and it delivers them in this very clear, concise way

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,540
that I really enjoy.

55
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,540
I think that's what a course on Python should be,

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,600
on the fundamentals of Python should be,

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,780
so if you're curious to learn how to program,

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,360
I think Python is the right language to start with.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,480
If you're curious to learn Python,

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,240
learn Python 3 at Codecademy.

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,340
That's definitely the go-to course I would recommend.

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,600
You can get 15% off your Codecademy Pro membership

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,120
when you go to codecademy.com and use promo code lex.

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,280
That's promo code lex at codecademy.com

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,060
to get 15% off Codecademy Pro,

66
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,940
the best way to learn to code.

67
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,560
This episode is sponsored by Linode,

68
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
Linux Virtual Machines.

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,160
It's an awesome compute infrastructure

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
that lets you develop, deploy, and scale

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,720
what applications you build faster and easier.

72
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,120
This is both for small personal projects and huge systems.

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,780
Lower cost than AWS,

74
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,360
but more important to me is the simplicity

75
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,380
and the quality of the customer service

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,380
with real human beings 24-7 every single day,

77
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,720
365 days a year.

78
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,140
I could, of course, talk a little bit about

79
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,740
the things I don't like about some of the big players

80
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,500
that Linode is competing with,

81
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,400
but it's probably better to focus on the good things

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,100
that Linode is doing in contrast to them.

83
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,740
Again, like I said, customer service

84
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,600
and just the simplicity of the interface

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,700
and how to set everything up and how to use it.

86
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,820
Their motto, of course, I love Linux.

87
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,260
Their motto is if it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

88
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,600
Visit linode.com slash Lex

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,420
and click on the Create Free Account button to get started.

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,340
And if you do, you get $100 in free credit.

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,140
That's linode.com slash Lex.

92
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,920
This show is sponsored by NetSuite.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,780
Running a business is hard.

94
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,740
If you own a business, don't let QuickBooks and spreadsheets

95
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,160
make it even harder than it needs to.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,460
You should consider upgrading to NetSuite.

97
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,060
It allows you to manage financials, HR, inventory,

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,640
e-commerce, and many more business-related details

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,000
all in one place.

100
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
I've probably talked about this before,

101
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,080
but I dislike bureaucracy

102
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,760
that companies sometimes build up around this.

103
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
NetSuite can probably help.

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
It's always really important

105
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
to have the right tool for the job.

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Anyway, whether you're doing a million

107
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
or hundreds of millions in revenue,

108
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,440
save time and money with NetSuite.

109
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,940

115
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,200
This show is sponsored by ExpressVPN.

116
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,360
I use them, have used them for many years

117
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
to protect my privacy on the internet.

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Obviously, as I've mentioned many times before,

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,200
ISPs don't necessarily have your best interest in mind

120
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,760
when it comes to your data.

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,320
So VPN can really help protect your data.

122
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,200
Another aspect that's very useful

123
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,760
is basically with a VPN,

124
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,300
you can specify your location to be anywhere.

125
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,960
So from the perspective of services online,

126
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,480
it can appear as if you're anywhere in the world.

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
And this is useful

128
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,040
like if you go to Netflix to watch shows

129
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,360
that are only available in certain parts of the world.

130
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,320
It's a way to travel without actually having to get up

131
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,960
from your computer desk.

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,040
It's brilliant.

133
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,000
Speaking of computer desk, it's not just about computers.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,920
It's all devices, all operating systems, including Linux.

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,480
Plus the ExpressVPN design itself is really nice.

136
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,200
There's a one power on button that says not connected

137
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,840
when you're not connected and connected

138
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,360
when you're connected.

139
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
Super easy to use, super fast.

140
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,320
Like I said, go to expressvpn.com slash lexpod

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,680
to get an extra three months free.

142
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,540
That's expressvpn.com slash lexpod.

143
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,760
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

144
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,160
And here is my conversation with Josje Bach.

145
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:21,120
Thank you for once again coming on to this particular Russian program and sticking to

146
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
the theme of a Russian program.

147
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's start with the darkest of topics.

148
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Privet.

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,600
So this is inspired by one of your tweets.

150
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,920
You wrote that, quote, when life feels unbearable,

151
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,760
I remind myself that I'm not a person.

152
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,240
I am a piece of software running on the brain of a random ape

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,640
for a few decades.

154
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,720
It's not the worst brain to run on.

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,840
Have you experienced low points in your life?

156
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
Have you experienced depression?

157
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,280
Of course, we all experience low points in our life.

158
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,200
And we get appalled by the things, by the ugliness of stuff around us.

159
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,400
We might get desperate about our lack of self-regulation.

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,680
And sometimes life is hard.

161
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,040
And I suspect you don't get to your life.

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,000
Nobody does to get through their life without low points and without moments where they

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
are despairing.

164
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,280
And I thought that let's capture this state and how to deal with that state.

165
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,040
And I found that very often you realise that when you stop taking things personally,

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,840
when you realise that this notion of a person is a fiction, similar as it is in Westworld,

167
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,080
where the robots realise that their memories and desires are just stuff that keeps them

168
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,280
in the loop and they don't have to act on those memories and desires.

169
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,680
That our memories and expectations is what make us unhappy.

170
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,360
And the present rarely does.

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,600
The day in which we are, for the most part, it's OK, right?

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,400
When we are sitting here, right here, right now, we can choose how we feel.

173
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,080
And the thing that affects us is the expectation that something is going to be different from

174
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,520
what we wanted to be or the memory that something was different from what you wanted it to be.

175
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,320
And once we basically zoom out from all this, what's left is not a person.

176
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,920
What's left is this state of being conscious, which is the software state.

177
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
And software doesn't have an identity.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,080
It's a physical law.

179
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,560
And it's a law that acts in all of us and it's embedded in a suitable substrate.

180
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,040
And we didn't pick that substrate, right?

181
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,200
We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,040
And they're all these individuals and everybody has to be one of them.

183
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,680
And eventually you're stuck on one of them and have to deal with that.

184
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,480
So you're like a leaf floating down the river.

185
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,160
You just have to accept that there's a river and you just float wherever it takes you.

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
You don't have to do this.

187
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,920
The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent is a construct.

188
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,640
What part of that is actually under your control?

189
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,860
And I think that our consciousness is largely a control model for our own attention.

190
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,320
So we notice where we are looking and we can influence what we are looking, how we are

191
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,120
disambiguating things, how we put things together in our mind.

192
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,280
And the whole system that runs us is this big cybernetic motivational system.

193
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,320
So we're basically like a little monkey sitting on top of an elephant.

194
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,820
And we can prod this elephant here and there to go this way or that way.

195
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,280
And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant or that we are telling it what

196
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
to do.

197
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,820
And sometimes we notice that it walks into a completely different direction.

198
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,840
And we didn't set this thing up, it just is the situation that we find ourselves in.

199
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,680
How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?

200
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
A lot.

201
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,320
But I think that our consciousness cannot create the motive force.

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,640
Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?

203
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,200
No, the monkey is the consciousness.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
The monkey is the attentional system that is observing things.

205
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,640
There is a large perceptual system combined with the motivational system that is actually

206
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
providing the interface to everything.

207
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,760
And our own consciousness, I think, is the tool that directs the attention of that system,

208
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,780
which means it singles out features and performs conditional operations for which it needs

209
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,260
an index memory.

210
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,040
But this index memory is what we perceive as our stream of consciousness.

211
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,240
But the consciousness is not in charge.

212
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
That's an illusion.

213
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,680
So everything outside of that consciousness is the elephant.

214
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,320
So it's the physics of the universe, but it's also society that's outside of your...

215
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,620
I would say the elephant is the agent.

216
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,620
So there is an environment in which the agent is stomping, and you are influencing a little

217
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,380
part of that agent.

218
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,340
So is the agent a single human being?

219
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,700
Which object has agency?

220
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,980
That's an interesting question.

221
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,780
I think a way to think about an agent is that it's a controller with a set point generator.

222
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,220
The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics and control theory.

223
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:04,460
The control system consists out of a system that is regulating some value and the deviation

224
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,300
of that value from a set point.

225
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,260
And it has a sensor that measures the system's deviation from that set point and an effector

226
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,920
that can be parameterized by the controller.

227
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,880
So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.

228
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,660
And the goal is to reduce the distance between the set point and the current value of the

229
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
system.

230
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,560
And there's an environment which disturbs the regulated system, which brings it away

231
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,900
from that set point.

232
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,160
So simplest case is the thermostat.

233
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,520
The thermostat is really simple because it doesn't have a model.

234
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,280
The thermostat is only trying to minimize the set point deviation in the next moment.

235
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,360
And if you want to minimize the set point deviation over a longer time span, you need

236
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
to integrate it.

237
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
You need to model what is going to happen.

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,680
So for instance, when you think about that your set point is to be comfortable in life,

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,680
maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first.

240
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
So you need to make a model of what's going to happen when.

241
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,680
And this is the task of the controller is to use its sensors to measure the state of

242
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,320
the environment and the system that is being regulated and figure out what to do.

243
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,440
And if the task is complex enough, the set points are complicated enough, and if the

244
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,520
controller has enough capacity and enough sensor feedback, then the task of the controller

245
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,200
is to make a model of the entire universe that it's in, the conditions under which

246
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,680
it exists and of itself.

247
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,160
And this is a very complex agent, and we are in that category.

248
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,760
And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.

249
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,880
It's a class of models that we use to interpret aspects of the universe.

250
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,760
And when we notice the environment around us, a lot of things only make sense at the

251
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
level that you're entangled with them if we interpret them as control systems that make

252
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,320
models of the world and try to minimize their own set points.

253
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,680
So the models are the agents.

254
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,800
The agent is a class of model, and we notice that we are an agent ourself.

255
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,960
We are the agent that is using our own control model to perform actions.

256
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,600
We notice we would use a change in the model and things in the world change.

257
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,840
And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body, that we are situated

258
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,280
environment and that we have a first person perspective.

259
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,480
Still don't understand.

260
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:22,280
What's the best way to think of which object has agency with respect to human beings?

261
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
Is it the body?

262
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,640
Is it the brain?

263
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,200
Is it the contents of the brain as agency?

264
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Like, what's the actuators that you're referring to?

265
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,320
What is the controller and where does it reside?

266
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
Or is it these impossible things?

267
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,960
Because I keep trying to ground it to space time, the three dimension of space and the

268
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,800
one dimension of time.

269
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,760
What's the agent in that for humans?

270
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,240
There is not just one.

271
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,280
It depends on the way in which you're looking at this thing and which you're framing it.

272
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,920
Imagine that you are, say, Angela Merkel and you are acting on behalf of Germany.

273
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,040
Then you could say that Germany is the agent.

274
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,360
And in the mind of Angela Merkel, she is Germany to some extent, because in the way in which

275
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,280
she acts, the destiny of Germany changes.

276
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,880
There are things that she can change that basically affect the behavior of that nation

277
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
state.

278
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,480
OK, so it's hierarchies of to go to another one of your tweets with I think you were playfully

279
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,200
mocking Jeff Hawkins with saying his brains all the way down.

280
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,960
So it's like it's agents all the way down.

281
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,120
It's agents made up of agents, made up of agents.

282
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,440
Like if Angela Merkel is Germany and Germany's made up a bunch of people and the people are

283
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,760
themselves agents in some kind of context, and then people are made up of cells, each

284
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
individual.

285
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,400
So is it agents all the way down?

286
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,080
I suspect that has to be like this in a world where things are self-organizing.

287
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,680
Most of the complexity that we are looking at, everything in life is about self-organization.

288
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:09,240
So I think up from the level of life, you have agents and below life, you rarely have

289
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,240
agents because sometimes you have control systems that emerge randomly in nature and

290
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,080
try to achieve a set point.

291
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,000
But they're not that interesting agents that make models.

292
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,120
And because to make an interesting model of the world, you typically need a system that

293
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
is true and complete.

294
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,560
Can I ask you a personal question?

295
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,160
What's the line between life and non-life?

296
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,560
It's personal because you're a life form.

297
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,640
What do you think in this emerging complexity, at which point does the thing start being

298
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,360
living and have agency?

299
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,920
Personally, I think that the simplest answer is that life is cells.

300
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Life is what?

301
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Cells.

302
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Cells.

303
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Biological cells.

304
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,520
So it's a particular kind of principle that we have discovered to exist in nature.

305
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:01,400
It's modular stuff that consists out of basically this DNA tape with a read-write head on top

306
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,960
of it that is able to perform arbitrary computations and state transitions within the cell.

307
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,280
And it's combined with a membrane that insulates the cell from its environment.

308
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,000
And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell that are in disequilibrium.

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,120
And the cell is running in such a way that this disequilibrium doesn't disappear.

310
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,880
And if the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.

311
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,560
And it requires something like a neck entropy extractor to maintain this disequilibrium.

312
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,600
So it's able to harvest neck entropy from its environment and keep itself running.

313
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,760
So there's information and there's a wall to maintain this disequilibrium.

314
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,320
But isn't this very earth-centric?

315
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,160
Like what you're referring to as a...

316
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm not making a normative notion.

317
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,560
You could say that there are probably other things in the universe that are cell-like

318
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,040
and lifelike.

319
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,480
And you could also call them life.

320
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,320
But eventually it's just a willingness to find an agreement of how to use the terms.

321
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,520
I like cells because it's completely co-extensional with the way that we use the word even before

322
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
we knew about cells.

323
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,240
So people were pointing at some stuff and saying, this is somehow animate and this is

324
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,120
very different from the non-animate stuff.

325
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,680
And what's the difference between the living and the dead stuff?

326
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,480
And it's mostly whether the cells are working or not.

327
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,320
And also this boundary of life where we say that, for instance, a virus is basically an

328
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,040
information packet that is subverting the cell and not life by itself.

329
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,800
That makes sense to me.

330
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,320
And it's somewhat arbitrary.

331
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,600
You could of course say that systems that permanently maintain a disequilibrium and

332
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,960
can self-replicate are always life.

333
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,000
And maybe that's a useful definition too.

334
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,880
But this is eventually just how you want to use the word.

335
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,520
Is it so useful for conversation, but is it somehow fundamental to the universe?

336
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,800
Do you think there's an actual line to eventually be drawn between life and non-life?

337
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,640
Or is it all a kind of continuum?

338
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,800
I don't think it's a continuum, but there's nothing magical that is happening.

339
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,640
Living systems are a certain type of machine.

340
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,440
What about non-living systems?

341
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,800
Is it also a machine?

342
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,600
There are non-living machines, but the question is at which point is the system able to perform

343
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,680
arbitrary state transitions to make representations?

344
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,280
And living things can do this.

345
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,600
And of course, we can also build non-living things that can do this.

346
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,040
But we don't know anything in nature that is not a cell and is not created by still

347
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,640
alive that is able to do that.

348
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,240
Not only do we not know.

349
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,320
I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise.

350
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,600
I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly.

351
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,440
There could be life of a very different kind right under our noses that we're just not

352
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,440
seeing because we're not either limitations of our cognitive capacity or we're just not

353
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,960
open-minded enough, either with the tools of science or just the tools of our mind.

354
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Yeah, that's possible.

355
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,600
I find this thought very fascinating.

356
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,320
And I suspect that many of us ask ourselves since childhood, what are the things that

357
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
we are missing?

358
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,320
What kind of systems and interconnections exist that are outside of our gaze?

359
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:40,080
But we are looking for it and physics doesn't have much room at the moment for opening up

360
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,640
something that would not violate the conservation of information as we know it.

361
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:53,600
Yeah, but I wonder about time scale and scale, spatial scale, whether we just need to open

362
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,640
up our idea of how life presents itself.

363
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,360
It could be operating in a much slower time scale, a much faster time scale.

364
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,680
And it's almost sad to think that there's all this life around us that we're not seeing

365
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:15,160
because we're just not thinking in terms of the right of the right scale, both time

366
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,640
and space.

367
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
What is your definition of life?

368
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,640
What do you understand as life?

369
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,240
Entities of sufficiently high complexity that are full of surprises.

370
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,920
I don't know.

371
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,840
I don't have a free will, so that just came out of my mouth.

372
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm not sure that even makes sense.

373
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,600
There's certain characteristics.

374
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,920
So complexity seems to be a necessary property of life.

375
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:55,680
And I almost want to say it has ability to do something unexpected.

376
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,000
It seems to me that life is the main source of complexity on earth.

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,020
And complexity is basically a bridgehead that order builds into chaos by modeling, by processing

378
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,960
information in such a way that you can perform reactions that would not be possible for dump

379
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
systems.

380
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,120
And this means that you can harvest neck entropy that dump systems cannot harvest.

381
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,520
And this is what complexity is mostly about.

382
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,200
In some sense, the purpose of life is to create complexity.

383
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah.

384
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Increasing.

385
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:38,360
I mean, there seems to be some kind of universal drive towards increasing pockets of complexity.

386
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,920
I don't know what that is.

387
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,680
That seems to be like a fundamental, I don't know if it's a property of the universe or

388
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,840
it's just a consequence of the way the universe works, but there seems to be this small pockets

389
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,680
of emergent complexity that builds on top of each other and starts having like greater

390
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,440
and greater complexity by having like a hierarchy of complexity.

391
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,040
Little organisms building up a little society that then operates almost as an individual

392
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,400
organism itself.

393
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,120
And all of a sudden you have Germany and Merkel.

394
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,400
That's not obvious to me.

395
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,760
Everything that goes up has to come down at some point, right?

396
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,760
So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere, it's usually the beginning of an S curve.

397
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,520
Whereas something eventually reaches saturation and the S curve is the beginning of some kind

398
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,960
of bump that goes down again.

399
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:36,240
And there is just this thing that when you are inside of an evolution of life, you are

400
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,240
on top of a puddle of negentropy that is being sucked dry by life.

401
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,300
And during that happening, you see an increase in complexity because life forms are competing

402
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:53,420
with each other to get more and more and finer and finer corner of that negentropy extraction.

403
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,060
But I feel like that's a gradual, beautiful process that almost follows a process akin

404
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,500
to evolution.

405
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,740
And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.

406
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,760
The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly.

407
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,900
So usually there's some kind of catastrophic event.

408
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,460
The Roman Empire took a long time.

409
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,820
But would you classify that as a decrease in complexity though?

410
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Yes.

411
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,140
I think that the size of the cities that could be fed has decreased dramatically.

412
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,460
And you could see that the quality of the art decreased and it did so gradually.

413
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,220
And maybe future generations, when they look at the history of the United States in the

414
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,140
21st century, will also talk about the gradual decline, not something that suddenly happens.

415
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,060
Do you have a sense of where we are?

416
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
Are we on the exponential rise?

417
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:58,140
Are we at the peak or are we at the downslope of the United States Empire?

418
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,860
It's very hard to say from a single human perspective, but it seems to me that we are

419
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,620
probably at the peak.

420
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,980
I think that's probably the definition of optimism and cynicism.

421
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,820
So my nature of optimism is, I think we're on the rise.

422
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,860
I think that's just all a matter of perspective.

423
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Nobody knows.

424
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:29,620
But I do think that erring on the side of optimism, you need a minimum number of optimists

425
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,260
in order to make that up thing actually work.

426
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,820
And so I tend to be on the side of the optimists.

427
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,180
I think that we are basically a species of grasshoppers that have turned into locusts.

428
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,500
And when you are in the locust mode, you see an amazing rise of population numbers and

429
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,140
of the complexity of the interactions between the individuals.

430
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,780
But ultimately, the question is, is it sustainable?

431
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:02,660
See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers that have become domesticated cats, to use

432
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
a different metaphor.

433
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,580
And so I'm not exactly sure we're so destructive.

434
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,100
We're just softer and nicer and lazier.

435
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,180
I think we have monkeys and not the cats.

436
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,820
And if you look at the monkeys, they are very busy.

437
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,300
The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?

438
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Not just the bonobos.

439
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,900
I think that all the monkeys are basically a discontent species that always needs to

440
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
meddle.

441
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,500
Well, the gorillas seem to have a little bit more of a structure, but it's a different

442
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,020
part of the tree.

443
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:38,180
OK, you mentioned the elephant and the monkey riding the elephant.

444
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,700
And consciousness is the monkey.

445
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,460
And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.

446
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,340
And sometimes the elephant listens.

447
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,820
I heard you got into some contentious, maybe you can correct me, but I heard you got into

448
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,180
some contentious free will discussions.

449
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,540
Is this with Sam Harris or something like that?

450
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,020
Not that I know of.

451
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,820
Some people on Clubhouse told me you made a bunch of big debate points about free will.

452
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:14,580
Well, let me just then ask you, where in terms of the monkey and the elephant, do you think

453
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,620
we land in terms of the illusion of free will?

454
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,780
How much control does the monkey have?

455
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,500
We have to think about what the free will is in the first place.

456
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
We are not the machine.

457
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,820
We are not the thing that is making the decisions.

458
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,300
We are a model of that decision-making process.

459
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,460
And there is a difference between making your own decisions and predicting your own decisions.

460
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,180
And that difference is the first-person perspective.

461
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:49,420
And what basically makes decision-making and the conditions of free will distinct from

462
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,020
just automatically doing the best thing is that we often don't know what the best thing

463
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
is.

464
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,380
We make decisions under uncertainty.

465
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,100
We make informed bets using a betting algorithm that we don't yet understand because we haven't

466
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,340
reverse engineered our own minds sufficiently.

467
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,940
We don't know the expected rewards.

468
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,220
We don't know the mechanism by which we estimate the rewards and so on.

469
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,340
But there is an algorithm.

470
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:17,860
We observe ourselves performing where we see that we weight facts and factors and the future,

471
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,620
and then some kind of possibility, some motive gets raised to an intention.

472
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,860
And that's informed bet that the system is making.

473
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,820
And that making of the informed bet, the representation of that is what we call free will.

474
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,420
And it seems to be paradoxical because we think that the crucial thing is that it's

475
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,620
somehow indeterministic.

476
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,140
And yet, if it was indeterministic, it would be random.

477
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,900
And it cannot be random because if it was random, if just dice were being thrown and

478
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,340
the universe randomly forces you to do things, it would be meaningless.

479
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,020
So the important part of the decisions is always the deterministic stuff.

480
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,900
But it appears to be indeterministic to you because it's unpredictable.

481
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,460
Because if it was predictable, you wouldn't experience it as a free will decision.

482
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,740
You would experience it as just doing the necessary right thing.

483
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,220
And you see this continuum between the free will and the execution of automatic behavior

484
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,220
when you're observing other people.

485
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,700
So for instance, when you are observing your own children, if you don't understand them,

486
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,380
you will abuse this agent model where you have an agent with a set point generator.

487
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,460
And the agent is doing the best it can to minimize the difference to the set point.

488
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,820
And it might be confused and sometimes impulsive or whatever, but it's acting on its own free will.

489
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,660
And when you understand what happens in the mind of the child, you see that it's automatic.

490
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,420
And you can outmodel the child.

491
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,740
You can build things around the child that will lead the child to making exactly the

492
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,180
decision that you are predicting.

493
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,500
And under these circumstances, like when you were a stage magician

494
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,300
or somebody who is dealing with people that you sell a car to,

495
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,300
and you completely understand the psychology and the impulses and the space of

496
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,620
thoughts that this individual can have at that moment.

497
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,420
Under these circumstances, it makes no sense to attribute free will

498
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,340
because it's no longer decision-making under uncertainty.

499
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,300
You are already certain.

500
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,940
For them, there's uncertainty, but you already know what they're doing.

501
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,820
But what about for you?

502
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:25,780
So is this akin to systems like cellular automata where it's deterministic,

503
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,740
but when you squint your eyes a little bit,

504
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,340
it starts to look like there's agents making decisions at the higher,

505
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,980
when you zoom out and look at the entities that are composed by the individual cells,

506
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:50,340
even though there's underlying simple rules that make the system evolve in deterministic ways,

507
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,700
it looks like there's organisms making decisions.

508
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,420
Is that where the illusion of free will emerges, that jump in scale?

509
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,460
It's a particular type of model, but this jump in scale is crucial.

510
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,580
The jump in scale happens whenever you have too many parts to count

511
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,580
and you cannot make a model at that level.

512
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,620
You try to find some higher-level regularity, and the higher-level regularity is a pattern

513
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:19,060
that you project into the world to make sense of it, and agency is one of these patterns.

514
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,260
You have all these cells that interact with each other, and the cells in our body are set up in

515
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,620
such a way that they benefit if their behavior is coherent, which means that they act as if

516
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,060
they were serving a common goal.

517
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,980
That means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms that act as if they were serving

518
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,020
a common goal.

519
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,180
Now you can make sense of all these cells by projecting the common goal into them.

520
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,900
For you, then, free will is an illusion?

521
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,180
No, it's a model, and it's a construct.

522
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,100
It's basically a model that the system is making of its own behavior.

523
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,300
It's the best model that it can come up with under the circumstances,

524
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,900
and it can get replaced by a different model, which is automatic behavior,

525
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,700
when you fully understand the mechanism under which you are acting.

526
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,060
Yeah, but another word for model is what?

527
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,620
Story.

528
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,860
So it's the story you're telling.

529
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,940
I mean, do you actually have control?

530
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:15,300
Is there such a thing as a you, and is there such a thing as you having control?

531
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:24,100
Are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?

532
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,700
In some sense, the you is the model of the system that is in control.

533
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,940
It's a story that the system tells itself about somebody who is in control.

534
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,980
Yeah.

535
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,740
And the contents of that model are being used to inform the behavior of the system.

536
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,780
Okay.

537
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:44,740
So the system is completely mechanical, and the system creates that story like a loom,

538
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,540
and then it uses the contents of that story to inform its actions

539
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,220
and writes the results of that actions into the story.

540
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,740
So how is that not an illusion?

541
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,540
The story is written, then, or rather, we're not the writers of the story.

542
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,660
Yes, but we always knew that.

543
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,380
No, we don't know that.

544
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,740
When did we know that?

545
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,300
I think that's mostly a confusion about concepts.

546
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,140
The conceptual illusion in our culture comes from the idea that we live in physical reality

547
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,820
and that we experience physical reality and that we have ideas about it.

548
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,180
And then you have this dualist interpretation where you have

549
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:30,980
two substances, res extensa, the world that you can touch and that is made of extended things,

550
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,140
and res cogitans, which is the world of ideas.

551
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,020
And in fact, both of them are mental representations.

552
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,940
One is the representations of the world as a game engine

553
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,140
that your mind generates to make sense of the perceptual data.

554
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,340
That's the physical world?

555
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,500
Yes, that's what we perceive as the physical world.

556
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,060
But we already know that the physical world is nothing like that, right?

557
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,300
Quantum mechanics is very different from what you and me perceive as the world.

558
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,180
The world that you and me perceive is a game engine.

559
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,820
Yeah.

560
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,220
And there are no colors and sounds in the physical world.

561
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,100
They only exist in the game engine generated by your brain.

562
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,820
And then you have ideas that cannot be mapped onto extended regions, right?

563
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,540
So the objects that have a spatial extension in the game engine are res extensa,

564
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,020
and the objects that don't have a physical extension in the game engine are ideas.

565
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,260
And they both interact in our mind to produce models of the world.

566
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:28,340
Yep. But when you play video games, I understand that what's actually happening is zeros and ones

567
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:39,380
inside of a computer, inside of a CPU and a GPU, but you're still seeing the rendering of that.

568
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:45,780
And you're still making decisions whether to shoot, to turn left, or to turn right,

569
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,740
if you're playing a shooter.

570
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,420
Every time I start thinking about Skyrim and Elder Scrolls

571
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,980
and walking around in beautiful nature and swinging a sword.

572
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,260
But it feels like you're making decisions inside that video game.

573
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:03,300
So even though you don't have direct access in terms of perception to the bits,

574
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,060
to the zeros and ones, it still feels like you're making decisions.

575
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,060
And your decisions are actually feels like they're being applied

576
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,180
all the way down to the zeros and ones.

577
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,420
Yes.

578
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,660
It feels like you have control even though you don't have direct access to reality.

579
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,660
So there is basically a special character in the video game that is being created by

580
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,620
the video game engine.

581
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,740
And this character is serving the aesthetics of the video game.

582
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,420
And that is you.

583
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,100
Yes. But I feel like I have control inside the video game.

584
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,900
All those 12-year-olds that kick my ass on the internet.

585
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,020
So when you play the video game, it doesn't really matter that there's zeros and ones.

586
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,780
You don't care about the bits of the bus.

587
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,500
You don't care about the nature of the CPU that it runs on.

588
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,860
What you care about are the properties of the game that you're playing.

589
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,540
And you hope that the CPU is good enough.

590
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,500
Yes.

591
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,380
And a similar thing happens when we interact with physics.

592
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,020
The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.

593
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,260
The world that you and me are in is a dream world.

594
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,620
How close is it to the real world though?

595
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,620
We know that it's not very close, but we know that the dynamics of the dream world

596
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,060
match the dynamics of the physical world to a certain degree of resolution.

597
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,300
But the causal structure of the dream world is different.

598
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,180
So you see, for instance, waves crashing on your feet, right?

599
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,460
But there are no waves in the ocean.

600
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,540
There's only water molecules that have

601
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:29,460
tangents between the molecules that are the result of electrons

602
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,100
in the molecules interacting with each other.

603
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Aren't they very consistent?

604
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,780
You're seeing a very crude approximation.

605
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:44,980
Isn't our dream world very consistent to the point of being mapped directly one-to-one

606
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,700
to the actual physical world as opposed to us being completely tricked?

607
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,300
This is like where you have Donald-

608
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,980
It's not a trick. That's my point.

609
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,780
It's not an illusion. It's a form of data compression.

610
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,980
It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics of too many parts to count

611
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,740
at the level at which we're entangled with the best model that you can find.

612
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,180
Yeah. So we can act in that dream world and our actions have impact in the real world,

613
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,660
in the physical world to which we don't have access.

614
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,220
Yes. But it's basically like accepting the fact that the software that we live in,

615
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,220
the dream that we live in is generated by something outside of this world that

616
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,100
you and me are in.

617
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,540
So is the software deterministic and do we not have any control?

618
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:30,580
Do we have? Free will is having a conscious being.

619
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,660
Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.

620
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,580
No, it's slightly different. Basically, in the same way as you are modeling

621
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:47,140
the water molecules in the ocean that engulf your feet when you are walking on the beach

622
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,860
as waves and there are no waves, but only the atoms and more complicated stuff

623
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:57,300
underneath the atoms and so on. And you know that, right? You would accept, yes,

624
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,460
there is a certain abstraction that happens here. It's a simplification of what happens

625
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,340
and the simplification that is designed in such a way that your brain can deal with it

626
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,780
temporarily and spatially in terms of resources and tuned for the predictive value. So you can

627
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,380
predict with some accuracy whether your feet are going to get wet or not.

628
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,620
But it's a really good interface and approximation.

629
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,580
Equations are a good approximation or they're a much better approximation.

630
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,940
So to me, waves is a really nice approximation of what all the complexity is happening underneath.

631
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Basically, it's a machine learning model that is constantly tuned to minimize surprises. So it

632
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,780
basically tries to predict as well as it can what you're going to perceive next.

633
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,140
Are we talking about which is the machine learning? Our perception system or the dream world?

634
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,220
Dream world is the result of the machine learning process of the perception system.

635
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,340
That's doing the compression.

636
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:01,540
Yes. And the model of you as an agent is not a different type of model. It's a different type,

637
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:08,740
but not different in its model-like nature from the model of the ocean. Some things are oceans,

638
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,700
some things are agents. And one of these agents is using your own control model,

639
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,380
the output of your model, the things that you perceive yourself as doing. And that is you.

640
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,940
What about the fact that when you're standing

641
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:34,180
with the water on your feet and you're looking out into the vast open water of the ocean and

642
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,700
then there's a beautiful sunset and the fact that it's beautiful and then maybe you have

643
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,820
friends or a loved one with you and you feel love. What is that? As the dream world? What is that?

644
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,700
Yes. It's all happening inside of the dream.

645
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,500
Okay. But see, the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.

646
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,860
Of course it's not real. The physical universe is real, but the physical universe is

647
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,500
incomprehensible and it doesn't have any feeling of realness. The feeling of realness that you

648
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,620
experience gets attached to certain representations where your brain assesses, this is the best model

649
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,420
of reality that I have. So the only thing that's real to you is the thing that's happening at the

650
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,980
very base of reality. Yeah. For something to be real, it needs to be implemented.

651
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:28,820
So the model that you have of reality is real in as far as it is a model. It's an appropriate

652
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:35,700
description of the world to say that there are models that are being experienced, but the world

653
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,540
that you experience is not necessarily implemented. There is a difference between a reality, a

654
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:48,180
simulation, and a simulacrum. The reality that we are talking about is something that fully emerges

655
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,380
over a causally closed lowest layer. And the idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer,

656
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,180
that basically our world emerges over that. Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory,

657
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,660
which basically says that we are in some kind of simulation universe and the real world needs to

658
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,020
be an apparent universe of that where the actual causal structure is. And when you look at the

659
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,500
ocean and your own mind, you are looking at a simulation that explains what you're going to see

660
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,220
next. So we are living in a simulation. Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.

661
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,620
And this simulation is different from the physical reality because the causal structure that is being

662
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,860
produced, what you are seeing is different from the causal structure of physics. But consistent.

663
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,860
Hopefully. If not, then you are going to end up in some kind of institution where people will take

664
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,820
care of you because your behavior will be inconsistent. Your behavior needs to work in

665
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,340
such a way that it's interacting with an accurately predictive model of reality. And if your brain is

666
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:50,020
unable to make your model of reality predictive, you will need help. So what do you think about

667
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:57,860
Donald Hoffman's argument that it doesn't have to be consistent, the dream world to what he calls

668
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,820
like the interface to the actual physical reality, where there could be evolution.

669
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,580
I think he makes an evolutionary argument, which is like it could be an evolutionary advantage

670
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:14,340
to have the dream world drift away from physical reality. I think that only works if you have

671
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,980
tenure. As long as you're still interacting with the ground whose model needs to be somewhat

672
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,860
predictive. Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure in the animal kingdom.

673
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,220
Yeah. And at some point we became too big to fail. So we became postmodernist.

674
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,260
It all makes sense now. There's no reality that we like.

675
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:44,580
Oh man. Okay. Yeah. But basically you can do magic. You can change your assessment of reality,

676
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,900
but eventually reality is going to come bite you in the ass if it's not predictive.

677
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:57,940
Do you have a sense of what is that base layer physical reality? You have these attempts at the

678
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:06,100
theories of everything. The very, very small like string theory or what Stephen Wolfram talks about

679
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:11,940
with a hyper grass. These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects. And then there is more like

680
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,940
quantum mechanics that's talking about objects that are much larger, but still very, very,

681
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:24,980
very tiny. Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is that is like at the lowest level?

682
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,100
The turtle at the very bottom. Do you have a sense what that turtle is?

683
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,820
I don't think that you can talk about where it is because space is emergent over the activity

684
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:41,700
of these things. So the coordinates only exist in relation to other things. And so you could,

685
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,340
in some sense, abstract it into locations that can hold information and trajectories

686
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,020
that the information can take between the different locations. And this is how we

687
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:57,060
construct our notion of space. And physicists usually have a notion of space that is continuous.

688
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:04,020
And this is a point where I tend to agree with people like Stephen Wolfram who are very skeptical

689
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,540
of the geometric notions. I think that geometry is the dynamics of too many parts to count. And

690
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,540
there are no infinities. If there were two infinities, you would be running into

691
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,140
contradictions, which is in some sense what Gödel and Turing discovered

692
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,380
in response to Hilbert's call. There are no infinities.

693
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,260
There are no infinities. There is unboundedness, but if you have a language that talks about

694
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,900
infinity, at some point the language is going to contradict itself, which means it's no longer

695
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,700
valid. In order to deal with infinities and mathematics, you have to postulate the existence

696
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,380
initially. You cannot construct the infinities. And that's an issue. You cannot build up an

697
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,100
infinity from zero. But in practice, you never do this, right? When you perform calculations,

698
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:54,900
you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count. And usually these numbers are not that

699
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,580
large. They're not Googles or something. The infinities that we are dealing with in our universe

700
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:08,100
are mathematically speaking relatively small integers. And still what we're looking at is

701
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:14,980
dynamics where a trillion things behave similar to a hundred trillion things or

702
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,660
something that is very, very large because they're converging. And these convergent dynamics,

703
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,340
these operators, this is what we deal with when we are doing the geometry.

704
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,900
Geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it's continuous because if we subdivide the space

705
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:39,700
sufficiently fine-grained, these things approach a certain dynamic. And this approached dynamic,

706
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:45,620
that is what we mean by it. But I don't think that infinity would work, so to speak, that you

707
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,180
would know the last digit of pi and that you have a physical process that rests on knowing the last

708
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:57,140
digit of pi. Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk of human cognition that we like discrete.

709
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,940
Discrete makes sense to us. Infinity doesn't in terms of our intuitions.

710
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,980
No, the issue is that everything that we think about needs to be expressed in some kind of mental

711
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:12,260
language, not necessarily a natural language, but some kind of mathematical language that your

712
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:18,100
neurons can speak that refers to something in the world. And what we have discovered is that

713
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,300
we cannot construct a notion of infinity without running into contradictions, which means that

714
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:29,140
such a language is no longer valid. And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy when

715
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,460
somebody came up with the notion of irrational numbers before it was time. There's this myth

716
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,860
that he had this person killed when he blabbed out the secret that not everything can be expressed

717
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,500
as a ratio between two numbers, but there are numbers between the ratios. The world was not

718
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:48,420
ready for this. And I think he was right. That has confused mathematicians very seriously because

719
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,860
these numbers are not values, they are functions. And so you can calculate these functions to a

720
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:58,260
certain degree of approximation, but you cannot pretend that Pi has actually a value.

721
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:05,060
Pi is a function that would approach this value to some degree, but nothing in the world rests

722
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:13,940
on knowing Pi. How important is this distinction between discrete and continuous for you to get to

723
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:21,860
the bottom? Because in discussion of your favorite flavor of the theory of everything, there's a few

724
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:31,860
on the table. So there's string theory, there's loop quantum gravity, which focused on one

725
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:39,700
particular unification. There's just a bunch of favorite flavors of different people trying to

726
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,820
propose a theory of everything. Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people throughout history,

727
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,940
and then of course, Stephen Wolfram, who I think is one of the only people doing a discrete-

728
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:59,700
No, no. There's a bunch of physicists who do this right now, like Topholi and Tomasello.

729
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,860
Digital physics is something that is, I think, growing in popularity. But the

730
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:17,620
main reason why this is interesting is because it's important sometimes to settle disagreements.

731
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,980
I don't think that you need infinities at all, and you never needed them.

732
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,180
You can always deal with very large numbers, and you can deal with limits. We are fine with doing

733
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,220
that. You don't need any kind of affinity. You can build your computer algebra systems just as well

734
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,260
without believing in infinity in the first place. So you're okay with limits?

735
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:41,060
Yeah. Basically, a limit means that something is behaving pretty much the same if you make the

736
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,860
number larger, because it's converging to a certain value, and at some point, the difference

737
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,980
becomes negligible, and you can no longer measure it. In this sense, you have things that,

738
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,740
if you have an n-gon which has enough corners, then it's going to behave like a circle at some

739
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:02,340
point. It's only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing that cannot exist in the physical

740
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:07,540
universe that you would be talking about this perfect circle. Now it turns out that it also

741
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,100
wouldn't work in mathematics, because you cannot construct mathematics that has infinite resolution

742
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,940
without running into contradictions. That is itself not that important, because we never did

743
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:23,540
that. It's just a thing that some people thought we could. This leads to confusion. For instance,

744
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:29,540
Roger Penrose uses this as an argument to say that there are certain things that mathematicians can

745
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:37,220
do dealing with infinities, and by extension, our mind can do that computers cannot do.

746
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:44,340
Yeah. He talks about that the human mind can do certain mathematical things that the computer,

747
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:50,980
as defined by the universal Turing machine, cannot. So it has to do with infinity.

748
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:56,420
Yes. It's one of the things. So he is basically pointing at the fact that there are things that

749
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:05,140
are possible in the mathematical mind and in pure mathematics that are not possible in

750
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,700
machines that can be constructed in the physical universe. Because he is an honest guy, he thinks

751
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,900
this means that present physics cannot explain operations that happen in our mind.

752
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:22,820
Do you think he's right? Let's leave his discussion of consciousness aside for the moment.

753
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,380
Do you think he's right about just what he's basically referring to as intelligence?

754
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:35,460
So is the human mind fundamentally more capable as a thinking machine than a universal Turing

755
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:43,060
machine? No. So he's suggesting that, right? So our mind is actually less than a Turing machine.

756
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:48,340
There can be no Turing machine because it's defined as having an infinite tape. And we always only

757
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,380
have a finite tape. Our minds can only perform finitely many operations. Yes, he thinks so.

758
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,740
He can do the kind of computation the Turing machine cannot.

759
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:01,700
That's because he thinks that our minds can do operations that have infinite resolution in

760
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:07,780
some sense. And I don't think that's the case. Our minds are just able to discover these limit

761
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:14,900
operators over too many parts to count. I see. What about his idea that consciousness

762
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:24,660
is more than a computation? So it's more than something that a Turing machine can do. So again,

763
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,700
saying that there's something special about our mind, they cannot be replicated in the machine.

764
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:37,380
The issue is that I don't even know how to construct a language to express this statement

765
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:50,260
correctly. Well, the basic statement is there's a human experience that includes intelligence,

766
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:55,780
that includes self-awareness, that includes the hard problem of consciousness. And the question

767
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:03,380
is, can that be fully simulated in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer as we

768
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:13,380
understand it today? Roger Pernero says no. So the universal Turing machine cannot simulate the

769
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,060
universe. So the interesting question is, and you have to ask him this, is why not? What is the

770
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:25,380
specific thing that cannot be modeled? And when I looked at his writings, and I haven't read all of

771
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:31,940
it, but when I read, for instance, the section that he writes in the introduction and wrote to

772
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:37,860
infinity, the thing that he specifically refers to is the way in which human minds deal with

773
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:47,060
infinities. And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed. A lot of people feel that our

774
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:52,500
experience cannot be explained in a mechanical way, and therefore, it needs to be different.

775
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:59,700
And I concur. Our experience is not mechanical. Our experience is simulated. It exists only in

776
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,020
a simulation. Only a simulation can be conscious. Physical systems cannot be conscious because they

777
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,140
are only mechanical. Cells cannot be conscious. Neurons cannot be conscious. Brains cannot be

778
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,220
conscious. People cannot be conscious if you understand them as physical systems.

779
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:20,260
What can be conscious is the story of a system in the world where you write all these things into

780
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:25,300
the story. You have experiences for the same reason that a character in a novel has experiences,

781
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,580
because it's written into the story. And now the system is acting on that story. And it's

782
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:35,060
not a story that is written in a natural language. It's written in a perceptual language, in this

783
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:41,060
multimedia language of the game engine. And in there, you write in what kind of experience

784
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,980
you have and what this means for the behavior of the system, for your behavior tendencies,

785
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,500
for your focus, for your attention, for your experience of valence, and so on.

786
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,820
And this is being used to inform the behavior of the system in the next step.

787
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:59,860
And then the story updates with the reactions of the system and the changes in the world and so on.

788
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,460
And you live inside of that model. You don't live inside of the physical reality.

789
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:14,740
Just to linger on it, it's in the perceptual language, the multimodal perceptual language.

790
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:22,260
That's the experience. That's what consciousness is within that model, within that story.

791
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:28,900
But do you have agency? When you play a video game, you can turn left and you can turn right

792
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:37,700
in that story. So in that dream world, how much control do you have? Is there such a thing as you

793
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:45,060
in that story? Is it right to say the main character? Everybody's NPCs, and then there's

794
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:51,060
the main character, and you're controlling the main character? Or is that an illusion? Is there

795
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,020
a main character that you're controlling? I'm getting to the point of the free will point.

796
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,940
Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer, and you've been to MIT computer science.

797
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:07,780
You basically know how to do that. And so you would say the robot is an agent that solves a

798
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:13,140
control problem, how to get the ball into the goal. And it needs to perceive the world, and the world

799
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:17,860
is disturbing him in trying to do this. So he has to control many variables to make that happen and

800
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,140
to project itself and the ball into the future and understand its position on the field relative

801
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:29,220
to the ball and so on, and the position of its limbs in the space around it and so on. So it

802
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:35,620
needs to have an adequate model that is directing reality in a useful way. And you could say that

803
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:42,740
this robot does have agency over what it's doing in some sense. And the model is going to be a

804
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:48,340
control model. And inside of that control model, you can possibly get to a point where this thing

805
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,980
is sufficiently abstract to discover its own agency. Our current robots don't do that. They

806
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,020
don't have a unified model of the universe, but there's not a reason why we shouldn't be getting

807
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:03,140
there at some point in the not too distant future. And once that happens, you will notice that the

808
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:11,460
robot tells a story about a robot playing soccer. So the robot will experience itself playing soccer

809
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:17,540
in a simulation of the world that it uses to construct a model of the locations of its legs

810
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:22,660
and limbs in space on the field with relationship to the ball. And it's not going to be at the level

811
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:28,500
of the molecules. It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level that is most suitable for

812
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,380
past planning of the movements of the robot. It's going to be a high-level abstraction,

813
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,580
but a very useful one that is as predictive as we can make it. And in that side of that story,

814
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:45,380
there is a model of the agency of that system. So this model can accurately predict that the

815
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:50,900
contents of the model are going to be driving the behavior of the robot in the immediate future.

816
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:57,700
But there's the hard problem of consciousness, which I would also, there's a subjective

817
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:04,100
experience of free will as well, that I'm not sure where the robot gets that, where that little leap

818
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:09,460
is. Because for me right now, everything I imagine with that robot, as it gets more and more and more

819
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:17,300
sophisticated, the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still, of what was programmed in.

820
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:22,340
You could probably do an end-to-end learning system. You maybe need to give it a few prayers

821
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:26,340
so you nudge the architecture in the right direction that it converges more quickly.

822
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,140
But ultimately, discovering the suitable hyperparameters of the architecture is also

823
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,660
only a search process. And as the search process was evolution, it has informed our brain

824
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,540
architecture so we can converge in a single lifetime on useful interaction with the world.

825
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:48,420
The problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly, so it's not just the parameters that

826
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,820
control this end-to-end learning system, but the entirety of the design of the robot.

827
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,380
You have to remove the human completely from the picture. And then in order to build the robot,

828
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:04,660
you have to create an entire universe. Because you have to go, you can't just shortcut evolution,

829
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,900
you have to go from the very beginning in order for it to have, because I feel like there's always

830
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:16,500
a human pulling the strings. And that makes it seem like the robot is cheating, it's getting a

831
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,740
shortcut to consciousness. When you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots, it doesn't

832
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,740
look as if there is somebody pulling the strings. It doesn't look like cheating anymore. Okay,

833
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,580
so let's go there because I got to talk to you about this. So obviously with the case of Boston

834
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:36,100
Dynamics, as you may or may not know, it's always either hard-coded or remote controlled.

835
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:41,140
There's no intelligence. I don't know how the current generation of Boston Dynamics robots works,

836
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:46,580
but what I've been told about the previous ones was that it's basically all cybernetic control,

837
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:52,900
which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on. But it's not deep learning for the

838
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:59,060
most part as it's currently done. It's for the most part just identifying a control hierarchy

839
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:03,780
that is congruent to the limbs that exist and the parameters that need to be optimized for the

840
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,700
movement of these limbs. And then there is a convergence progress. So it's basically just

841
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,540
regression that you would need to control this. But again, I don't know whether that's true.

842
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,900
That's just what I've been told about how that works. We have to separate several

843
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:21,780
levels of discussions here. So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control with no

844
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:30,180
machine learning in order to maintain balance or to write itself. It's a control problem in terms of

845
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,700
using the actuators to when it's pushed or when it steps on a thing that's uneven,

846
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,180
how to always maintain balance. And there's a tricky set of heuristics around that, but

847
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:46,900
that's the only goal. Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing in terms of that to us humans is

848
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:54,020
compelling, which is any kind of higher order movement like turning, wiggling its butt,

849
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,780
jumping back on its two feet, dancing. Dancing is even worse because dancing is hard

850
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:12,100
coded in. It's choreographed by humans. There's choreography software. So of all that high level

851
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:21,540
movement, there's no anything that you certainly can't call AI, but there's no even basic heuristics.

852
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:30,580
It's all hard coded in. And yet we humans immediately project agency onto them, which is

853
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:36,420
fascinating. So the gap here is it doesn't necessarily have agency. What it has is cybernetic

854
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,220
control. And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy of feedback loops that keep the

855
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,700
behavior in certain boundaries so the robot doesn't fall over and it's able to perform the

856
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,660
movements. And the choreography cannot really happen with motion capture because the robot

857
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,740
would fall over because the physics of the robot, the weight distribution and so on is different

858
01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:01,140
from the weight distribution in the human body. So if you were using the directly motion captured

859
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,140
movements of the human body to project it into this robot, it wouldn't work. You can do this

860
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:10,100
with a computer animation. It would look a little bit off, but who cares? But if you want to correct

861
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:16,580
for the physics, you need to basically tell the robot where it should move its limbs. And then

862
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:21,780
the control algorithm is going to approximate a solution that makes it possible within the physics

863
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:27,140
of the robot. And you have to find the basic solution for making that happen. And there's

864
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:32,820
probably going to be some regression necessary to get the control architecture to make these

865
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:38,420
movements. But those two layers are separate. So the thing, the higher level instruction of

866
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,540
how you should move and where you should move is the higher level.

867
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:46,420
I expect that the control level of these robots at some level is dumb. This is just the

868
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:52,420
physical control movement, the motor architecture. But it's a relatively smart motor architecture.

869
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,420
It's just that there is no high level deliberation about what decisions to make necessarily.

870
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:00,500
Yeah. But see, it doesn't feel like free will or consciousness.

871
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:06,660
No, that was not where I was trying to get to. I think that in our own body, we have that too.

872
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:11,860
So we have a certain thing that is basically just a cybernetic control architecture that is

873
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:17,700
moving our limbs. And deep learning can help in discovering such an architecture if you don't

874
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:22,900
have it in the first place. If you already know your hardware, you can maybe handcraft it. But

875
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,740
if you don't know your hardware, you can search for such an architecture. And this work already

876
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:32,340
existed in the 80s and 90s. People were starting to search for control architectures by motor

877
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:37,140
babbling and so on, and just use reinforcement learning architectures to discover such a thing.

878
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:43,060
And now imagine that you have the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you.

879
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:49,700
And you extend this a little bit. So you are seeking out food, for instance, or rest,

880
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:56,660
or so on. And you get to have a baby at some point. And now you add more and more control

881
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,620
layers to this. And the system is reverse engineering its own control architecture

882
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:07,220
and builds a high level model to synchronize the pursuit of very different conflicting goals.

883
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,740
And this is how I think you get to purposes. Purposes are models of your goals. The goals

884
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:17,700
may be intrinsic as a result of the different set point violations that you have. Hunger and thirst

885
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,740
were very different things. And rest and pain avoidance and so on. And you put all these things

886
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,380
together. And eventually, you need to come up with a strategy to synchronize them all.

887
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,740
And you don't need just to do this alone by yourself because you are state building

888
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:38,820
organisms. We cannot function as isolation the way that homo sapiens is set up. So our own

889
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:45,220
behavior only makes sense when you zoom out very far into a society or even into ecosystemic

890
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:50,660
intelligence on the planet and our place in it. So the individual behavior only makes sense in

891
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:56,020
these larger contexts. And we have a number of priors built into us. So we are behaving as if

892
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,900
we were acting on these high level goals pretty much right from the start. And eventually,

893
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,740
in the course of our life, we can reverse engineer the goals that we are acting on,

894
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,780
what actually are our higher level purposes. And the more we understand that, the more our

895
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,500
behavior makes sense. But this is all, at this point, complex stories within stories

896
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:21,300
that are driving our behavior. Yeah. I just don't know how big of a leap it is to start

897
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,740
create a system that's able to tell stories within stories.

898
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:29,700
Like how big of a leap that is from where currently Boston Dynamics is

899
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:39,140
or any robot that's operating in the physical space. And that leap might be big if it requires

900
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:43,060
to solve the hard problem of consciousness, which is telling a hell of a good story.

901
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:48,340
I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple. What's hard is perception

902
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,460
and the interface between perception and reasoning.

903
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:57,700
There's, for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior that would be built into

904
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:05,380
such a system by Yoshua Bengio. And what he describes, and I think that's accurate, is that

905
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:11,780
our own model of the world can be described through something like an energy function.

906
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,900
The energy function is modeling the contradictions that exist within the model at any given point.

907
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,140
And you try to minimize these contradictions, the tangents in the model. And to do this,

908
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:25,860
you need to sometimes test things. You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground.

909
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:30,500
You need to distinguish whether this is true or that is true, and so on. Eventually,

910
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,300
you get to an interpretation. But you will need to manually depress a few points in your model to

911
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,860
let it snap into a state that makes sense. And this function that tries to get the biggest dip

912
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,420
in the energy function in your model, according to Yoshua Bengio, is related to consciousness.

913
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:50,260
It's a low-dimensional, discrete function that tries to maximize this dip in the energy function.

914
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:57,060
Yeah. I think I would need to dig into details because I think the way he uses the word

915
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:02,020
consciousness is more akin to self-awareness, like modeling yourself within the world,

916
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,540
as opposed to the subjective experience, the hard problem.

917
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,420
No, it's not even the self within the world. The self is the agent, and you don't need to

918
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:15,860
be aware of yourself in order to be conscious. The self is just a particular content that you

919
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:21,700
can have, but you don't have to have. But you can be conscious in, for instance, a dream at night

920
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:27,220
or during a meditation state, but you don't have a self. You're just aware of the fact that you

921
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:33,620
are aware. And what we mean by consciousness in the colloquial sense is largely this

922
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:38,340
reflexive self-awareness, that you become aware of the fact that you're paying attention,

923
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,140
that we are the thing that pays attention. We are the thing that pays attention, right?

924
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:52,580
I don't see the awareness that we're aware. The hard problem doesn't feel like it's solved.

925
01:06:54,580 --> 01:07:00,500
It's called a hard problem for a reason, because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.

926
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:06,500
Yeah. I think the major leap is to understand how it is possible that a machine can dream,

927
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:12,740
that a physical system is able to create a representation that the physical system is

928
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:18,020
acting on, and that is spun force and so on. But once you accept the fact that you are not

929
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:23,300
in physics, but that you exist inside of the story, I think the mystery disappears. Everything is

930
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,380
possible in a story. You exist inside the story. Okay. Your consciousness is being written into

931
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:31,940
the story. The fact that you experience things is written to the side of the story. You ask yourself,

932
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:35,380
is this real what I'm seeing? Your brain writes into the story. Yes, it's real.

933
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:40,660
What about the perception of consciousness? To me, you look conscious.

934
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:49,860
The illusion of consciousness, the demonstration of consciousness. I ask for the legged robot.

935
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:56,420
How do we make this legged robot conscious? There's two things, and maybe you can tell me if they're

936
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:02,580
neighboring ideas. One is actually make it conscious, and the other is make it appear

937
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:10,260
conscious to others. Are those related? Let's ask it from the other direction. What would it

938
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:16,660
take to make you not conscious? When you are thinking about how you perceive the world,

939
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:23,700
can you decide to switch from looking at qualia to looking at representational states?

940
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:30,020
And it turns out you can. There is a particular way in which you can look at the world and recognize

941
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:35,220
its machine nature, including your own. And in that state, you don't have that conscious experience

942
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:42,020
in this way anymore. It becomes apparent as a representation. Everything becomes opaque.

943
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:47,220
And I think this thing that you recognize everything as a representation, this is typically

944
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:52,820
what we mean with enlightenment states. And you can have it on the motivational level,

945
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:58,260
but you can also do this on the experiential level, on the perceptual level.

946
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:06,740
See, but then I can come back to a conscious state. Okay. I'm referring to the

947
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:14,180
social aspect that the demonstration of consciousness is a really nice thing at a party

948
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:20,820
when you're trying to meet a new person. It's a nice thing to know that they're conscious and

949
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,940
they can, I don't know how fundamental consciousness is in human interaction,

950
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:32,660
but it seems like to be at least an important part. And I asked that in the same kind of way

951
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:41,460
for robots, in order to create a rich, compelling human robot interaction, it feels like there needs

952
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:46,340
to be elements of consciousness within that interaction. My cat is obviously conscious.

953
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,300
And so my cat can do this party trick. She also knows that I am conscious,

954
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,900
be able to have feedback about the fact that we are both acting on models of our own awareness.

955
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:04,180
The question is how hard is it for the robot, artificially created robot to achieve cat level

956
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:11,140
and party tricks? Yes. So the issue for me is currently not so much on how to build a system

957
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:16,980
that creates a story about a robot that lives in the world, but to make an adequate representation

958
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:24,580
of the world. And the model that you and me have is a unified one. It's one where you basically

959
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:29,140
make sense of everything that you can perceive. Every feature in the world that enters your

960
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:35,220
perception can be relationally mapped to a unified model of everything. And we don't have an AI that

961
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:40,900
is able to construct such a unified model yet. So you need that unified model to do the party trick?

962
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:46,420
Yes. I think that it doesn't make sense if this thing is conscious, but not in the same universe

963
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:51,060
as you, because you could not relate to each other. So what's the process, would you say,

964
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,020
of engineering consciousness in a machine? What are the ideas here?

965
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:02,340
So you probably want to have some kind of perceptual system. This perceptual system is

966
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:08,580
a processing agent that is able to track sensory data and predict the next frame and the sensory

967
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:13,860
data from the previous frames of the sensory data and the current state of the system.

968
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:18,900
So the current state of the system is perception instrumental to predicting what happens next.

969
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,300
And this means you build lots and lots of functions that take all the blips that you

970
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:29,220
feel on your skin and that you see on your retina or that you hear and puts them into

971
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:34,260
a set of relationships that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data, what kind of sensor of

972
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:39,060
vector of blips you're going to perceive in the next frame. This is

973
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:43,060
tuned and it's constantly tuned until it gets as accurate as it can.

974
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:50,580
You build a very accurate prediction mechanism that is step one of the perception. So at first

975
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,860
you predict, then you perceive and see the error in your prediction.

976
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,860
And you have to do two things to make that happen. One is you have to build a network

977
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:03,860
of relationships that are constraints that take all the variants in the world, put each of the

978
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:10,020
variances into a variable that is connected with relationships to other variables.

979
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,420
And these relationships are computable functions that constrain each other. So when you see a nose

980
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:18,660
that points in a certain direction in space, you have a constraint that says there should be a

981
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:23,060
face nearby that has the same direction. And if that is not the case, you have some kind

982
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:26,260
of contradiction that you need to resolve because it's probably not a nose what you're

983
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:32,260
looking at. It just looks like one. So you have to reinterpret the data until you get to a point

984
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:38,340
where your model converges. And this process of making the sensory data fit into your model

985
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:46,100
structure is what Piaget calls the assimilation. And accommodation is the change of the models

986
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,140
where you change your model in such a way that you can assimilate everything.

987
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:54,420
So you're talking about building a hell of an awesome perception system

988
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,100
that's able to do prediction and perception and correct and keep improving.

989
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:04,260
Wait, there's more. Yes, there's more. So the first thing that we wanted to do is we want to

990
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:08,980
minimize the contradictions in the model. And of course, it's very easy to make a model in

991
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:12,820
which you minimize the contradictions just by allowing that it can be in many, many possible

992
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:18,500
states. So if you increase degrees of freedom, you will have fewer contradictions. But you also

993
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,740
want to reduce the degrees of freedom because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty. You want

994
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:28,740
your model to reduce uncertainty as much as possible. But reducing uncertainty is expensive.

995
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:34,900
So you have to have a trade-off between minimizing contradictions and reducing uncertainty. And you

996
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:40,820
have only a finite amount of compute and experimental time and effort available to reduce uncertainty in

997
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:46,420
the world. So you need to assign value to what you observe. So you need some kind of motivational

998
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,980
system that is estimating what you should be looking at and what you should be thinking

999
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:54,100
about it, how you should be applying your resources to model what that is.

1000
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:59,540
So you need to have something like convergence links that tell you how to get from the present

1001
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:03,540
state of the model to the next one. You need to have these compatibility links that tell you

1002
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:09,940
which constraints exist and which constraint violations exist. And you need to have some kind

1003
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:14,340
of motivational system that tells you what to pay attention to. So now we have a second agent next

1004
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:19,220
to the perceptual agent. We have a motivational agent. This is a cybernetic system that is

1005
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,540
modeling what the system needs, what's important for the system, and that interacts with the

1006
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:28,580
perceptual system to maximize the expected reward. And you're saying the motivational system is some

1007
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:35,860
kind of like, what is it, a higher level narrative over some lower level? It's just your brainstem

1008
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:40,100
stuff, the limbic system stuff that tells you, okay, now you should get something to eat because

1009
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,940
I've just measured your blood sugar. So you mean like motivational system, like the lower level

1010
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:48,900
stuff, like hungry? Yes. There's basically physiological needs and some cognitive needs

1011
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,820
and some social needs, and they all interact. And they all implemented different parts in your

1012
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:56,820
nervous system as the motivational system. But they're basically cybernetic feedback loops.

1013
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:03,540
It's not that complicated. It's just a lot of code. And so you now have a motivational agent

1014
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:10,100
that makes your robot go for the ball or that makes your worm go to eat food and so on. And

1015
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,780
you have the perceptual system that lets it predict the environment so it's able to solve

1016
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:18,420
that control problem to some degree. And now what we learned is that it's very hard to build a

1017
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:23,380
machine learning system that looks at all the data simultaneously to see what kind of relationships

1018
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:28,900
could exist between them. So you need to selectively model the world. You need to figure out,

1019
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,420
where can I make the biggest difference if I would put the following things together?

1020
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,540
Sometimes you find a gradient for that. When you have a gradient, you don't need to remember where

1021
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:42,500
you came from. You just follow the gradient until it doesn't get any better. But if you have a world

1022
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:47,220
where the problems are discontinuous and the search spaces are discontinuous, you need to

1023
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,700
retain memory of what you explored. You need to construct a plan of what to explore next.

1024
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:57,460
And this thing means that you have next to this perceptual construction system

1025
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:03,940
and the motivational cybernetics, an agent that is paying attention to what it should select at

1026
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,820
any given moment to maximize reward. And this scanning system, this attention agent,

1027
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:13,380
is required for consciousness. And consciousness is its control model.

1028
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:20,420
So it's the index memories that this thing retains when it manipulates the perceptual representations

1029
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:27,380
to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts in it to increase coherence. So the purpose of

1030
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:32,500
consciousness is to create coherence in your perceptual representations, remove conflicts,

1031
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:37,380
predict the future, construct counterfactual representations so you can coordinate your actions

1032
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:43,300
and so on. And in order to do this, it needs to form memories. These memories are partial

1033
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:49,220
binding states of the working memory contents that are being revisited later on to backtrack,

1034
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:55,060
to undo certain states, to look for alternatives. And these index memories that you can recall,

1035
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:59,460
that is what you perceive as your stream of consciousness. And being able to recall these

1036
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,780
memories, this is what makes you conscious. If you could not remember what you paid attention to,

1037
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:11,620
you wouldn't be conscious. So consciousness is the index in the memory database. Okay.

1038
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:18,340
But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness a little further.

1039
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:26,260
So we usually relate suffering to consciousness. So the capacity to suffer.

1040
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:33,060
I think to me that's a really strong sign of consciousness, is a thing that can suffer.

1041
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:42,580
How is that useful? Suffering. And in your model where you just described which is indexing of

1042
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:49,460
memories and what is the coherence with the perception, with this predictive thing that's

1043
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:56,260
going on in the perception, how does suffering relate to any of that? The higher level suffering

1044
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:05,060
that humans do. Basically pain is a reinforcement signal. Pain is a signal that one part of your

1045
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:10,660
brain sends to another part of your brain or an abstract sense, part of your mind sends to another

1046
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:15,620
part of the mind to regulate its behavior, to tell it the behavior that you're currently exhibiting

1047
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:21,940
should be improved. And this is the signal that I tell you to move away from what you're currently

1048
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:28,500
doing and push into a different direction. So pain gives you a part of you an impulse to do

1049
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:34,420
something differently. But sometimes this doesn't work because the training part of your brain is

1050
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:39,300
talking to the wrong region or because it has the wrong model of the relationships in the world.

1051
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:43,140
Maybe you're mismodeling yourself or you're mismodeling the relationship of yourself to

1052
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:47,060
the world or you're mismodeling the dynamics of the world. So you're trying to improve something

1053
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:51,940
that cannot be improved by generating more pain, but the system doesn't have any alternative.

1054
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,820
So it doesn't get better. What do you do if something doesn't get better and you want it

1055
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:01,780
to get better? You increase the strengths of the signal. And then the signal becomes chronic when

1056
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:07,780
it becomes permanent without a change inside. This is what we call suffering. And the purpose

1057
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:13,140
of consciousness is to deal with contradictions, with things that cannot be resolved. The purpose

1058
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:17,780
of consciousness, I think, is similar to a conductor in an orchestra. When everything

1059
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:22,340
works well, the orchestra doesn't need much of a conductor as long as it's coherent.

1060
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:26,420
But when there is a lack of coherence or something is consistently producing

1061
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:32,180
disharmony and mismatches, then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it. So suffering

1062
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:38,020
attracts the activity of our consciousness. And the purpose of that is ideally that we bring new

1063
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:44,660
layers online, new layers of modeling that are able to create a model of the dysregulation so

1064
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:50,020
we can deal with it. And this means that we typically get higher level consciousness,

1065
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:54,500
so to speak. We get some consciousness above our pay grade maybe if we have some suffering

1066
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:59,140
early in our life. Most of the interesting people had trauma early on in their childhood.

1067
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:05,300
And trauma means that you are suffering an injury for which the system is not prepared,

1068
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,220
which it cannot deal with, which it cannot insulate itself from. So something breaks.

1069
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:17,380
And this means that the behavior of the system is permanently disturbed in the way that some

1070
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:22,580
mismatch exists now in the regulation, that just by following your impulses, by following the pain

1071
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:27,460
and the direction which it hurts, the situation doesn't improve but get worse. And so what needs

1072
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:33,220
to happen is that you grow up. And that's part that is grown up is able to deal with the part

1073
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:36,660
that is stuck in this earlier phase. Yeah, so it leads to growth,

1074
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:43,220
you're adding extra layers to your cognition. Let me ask you then, because I gotta stick on

1075
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:50,980
suffering, the ethics of the whole thing. So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others.

1076
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:59,220
You've tweeted, one of my biggest fears is that insects could be conscious. The amount of suffering

1077
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:08,660
on earth would be unthinkable. So when we think of other conscious beings, it's suffering

1078
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,900
a property of consciousness that we're most concerned about. So

1079
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:24,820
I'm still thinking about robots, how to make sense of other non-human things

1080
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:34,100
that appear to have the depth of experience that humans have. And to me, that means consciousness

1081
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:41,860
and the darkest side of that, which is suffering, the capacity to suffer. And so I started thinking,

1082
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:48,260
how much responsibility do we have for those other conscious beings? That's where the

1083
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:57,140
definition of consciousness becomes most urgent. Having to come up with the definition of consciousness

1084
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:03,220
becomes most urgent, is who should we and should we not be torturing?

1085
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:10,100
There's no general answer to this. Was Genghis Khan doing anything wrong?

1086
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:17,220
It depends on how you look at it. Well, he drew a line somewhere.

1087
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:26,020
Where this is us and that's them. It's the circle of empathy. You don't have to use the word

1088
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:32,580
consciousness, but these are the things that matter to me if they suffer or not. And these

1089
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:36,900
are the things that don't matter to me. Yeah. But when one of his commanders failed him, he

1090
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:44,660
broke his spine and let him die in a horrible way. And so in some sense, I think he was indifferent

1091
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:50,900
to suffering. He was not different in the sense that he didn't see it as useful if he inflicted

1092
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:57,540
suffering, but he did not see it as something that had to be avoided. That was not the goal.

1093
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:03,380
The question was, how can I use suffering and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals

1094
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:10,420
from his perspective? I see. So like different societies throughout history put different value

1095
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,700
on the- Different individuals, different psyches, right?

1096
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:19,540
But also even the objective of avoiding suffering. Like some societies probably,

1097
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:26,740
I mean, this is where like religious belief really helps. That afterlife, it doesn't matter

1098
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:33,060
that you suffer or die. What matters is you suffer honorably, right? So that you enter the afterlife.

1099
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:40,740
It seems to be superstitious to me. Basically beliefs that assert things for which no evidence

1100
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:45,860
exists are incompatible with sound epistemology. And I don't think that religion has to be

1101
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:50,020
superstitious. Otherwise it should be condemned in all cases. You're somebody who's saying,

1102
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:56,340
we live in a dream world. We have zero evidence for anything. That's not the case. There are limits

1103
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:01,540
to what languages can be constructed. Mathematics brings solid evidence for its own structure.

1104
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:07,140
And once we have some idea of what languages exist and how a system can learn and what learning

1105
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:15,060
itself is in the first place, we can begin to realize that our intuitions, that we are able

1106
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:20,180
to learn about the regularities of the world and minimize surprise and understand the nature of our

1107
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:26,180
own agency to some degree of abstraction. That's not an illusion. It's a useful approximation.

1108
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:30,340
Just because we live in a dream world doesn't mean mathematics can't

1109
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,980
give us a consistent glimpse of objective reality.

1110
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:44,260
We can basically distinguish useful encodings from useless encodings. And when we apply our

1111
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:48,900
truth seeking to the world, we know we usually cannot find out whether a certain thing is true.

1112
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:54,180
What we typically do is we take the state vector of the universe, separate it into separate objects

1113
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:58,500
that interact with each other, so interfaces. And this distinction that we are making is not

1114
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:04,900
completely arbitrary. It's done to optimize the compression that we can apply to our models of

1115
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:09,940
the universe so we can predict what's happening with our limited resources. In this sense,

1116
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:15,380
it's not arbitrary. But the separation of the world into objects that are somehow discrete

1117
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:21,060
and interacting with each other is not the true reality. The boundaries between the objects are

1118
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:24,260
projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected. But still,

1119
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,220
it's only an approximation of what's actually the case.

1120
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:32,340
And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions when we try to understand

1121
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:38,020
high level things like economic aspects of the world and so on, or political aspects or

1122
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,500
psychological aspects where we make simplifications. And the objects that we are using to separate the

1123
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:48,260
world are just one of many possible projections of what's going on. And so it's not in this

1124
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:52,340
postmodernist sense completely arbitrary and you're free to pick what you want or dismiss

1125
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:57,380
what you don't like because it's all stories. No, that's not true. You have to show for every model

1126
01:25:57,380 --> 01:26:01,860
of how well it predicts the world. So the confidence that you should have in the entities

1127
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:05,140
of your models should correspond to the evidence that you have.

1128
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:15,460
Can I ask you on a small tangent to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people,

1129
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:27,860
which is postmodernism? What is postmodernism? How would you define it? And why to you is it not

1130
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:34,580
a useful framework of thought? Postmodernism is something that I'm really not an expert on.

1131
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:41,540
And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas that it's difficult to lump together

1132
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:48,980
that is characterized by some useful thinkers, some of them post structuralist and so on.

1133
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:53,860
And I'm mostly not interested in it because I think that it's not leading me anywhere that I

1134
01:26:53,860 --> 01:27:00,020
find particularly useful. It's mostly, I think, born out of the insight that the ontologies

1135
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:05,140
that we impose on the world are not literally true and that we can often get to a different

1136
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:09,780
interpretation by the world by using a different ontology that is different separation of the world

1137
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:17,060
into interacting objects. But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories that are arbitrary,

1138
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:24,500
I think is wrong. And the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy are working in an area

1139
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:29,060
that I largely don't find productive. There's nothing useful coming out of this. So this idea

1140
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:34,100
that truth is relative is not something that has, in some sense, informed physics or theory

1141
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:40,020
of relativity, and there is no feedback between those. There is no meaningful influence of this

1142
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:45,380
type of philosophy on the sciences or on engineering or in politics. But there is a very strong

1143
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:55,220
information on ideology because it basically has become an ideology that is justifying itself

1144
01:27:55,220 --> 01:28:01,540
by the notion that truth is a relative concept. And it's not being used in such a way that the

1145
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:07,540
philosophers or sociologists that take up these ideas say, oh, I should doubt my own ideas because

1146
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:11,700
maybe my separation of the world into objects is not completely valid and I should maybe use

1147
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:18,020
a different one and be open to a pluralism of ideas. But it mostly exists to dismiss the ideas

1148
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:24,180
of other people. Yeah, it becomes a political weapon of sorts to achieve power.

1149
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:31,620
Basically, there's nothing wrong, I think, with developing a philosophy around this. But

1150
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:37,460
to develop norms around the idea that truth is something that is completely negotiable

1151
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:44,980
is incompatible with the scientific project. And I think if the academia has no defense against

1152
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:49,780
the ideological parts of the postmodernist movement, it's doomed.

1153
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:57,300
Right. You have to acknowledge the ideological part of any movement actually, including postmodernism.

1154
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:02,020
Well, the question is what an ideology is. And to me, an ideology is basically a viral

1155
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:08,660
memeplex that is changing your mind in such a way that reality gets warped. It gets warped

1156
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:12,500
in such a way that you're being cut off from the rest of human thought space. And you cannot

1157
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:17,780
consider things outside of the range of ideas of your own ideology as possibly true.

1158
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:22,580
I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology that make it harmful. One of them is that

1159
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:30,180
dogmatism of just certainty, dogged certainty in that you're right, you have the truth,

1160
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,420
and nobody else does. Yeah, but what is creating the certainty?

1161
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:37,700
It's very interesting to look at the type of model that is being produced. Is it basically just a

1162
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:42,660
strong prior? And you tell people, oh, this idea that you consider to be very true, the evidence

1163
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:46,660
for this is actually just much weaker than you thought. And look here at some studies. No,

1164
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:52,420
this is not how it works. It's usually normative, which means some thoughts are unthinkable

1165
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:58,340
because they would change your identity into something that is no longer acceptable.

1166
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:04,580
And this cuts you off from considering an alternative. And many de facto religions

1167
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:09,220
use this trick to lock people into a certain mode of thought. And this removes agency over

1168
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:14,740
your own thoughts. And it's very ugly to me. It's basically not just a process of domestication,

1169
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:21,300
but it's actually an intellectual castration that happens. It's an inability to think creatively

1170
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:29,380
and to bring forth new thoughts. I can ask you about substances, chemical

1171
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:38,980
substances that affect the video game, the dream world. So psychedelics that increasingly have been

1172
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:44,660
getting a lot of research done on them. So in general, psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA,

1173
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:52,100
but also a really interesting one, the big one, which is DMT. What and where are the places that

1174
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:59,620
these substances take the mind that is operating in the dream world? Do you have an interesting

1175
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:06,580
sense how this throws a wrinkle into the prediction model? Is it just some weird little quirk,

1176
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:10,820
or is there some fundamental expansion of the mind going on?

1177
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:19,380
I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics is that they induce particular types of lucid dreaming

1178
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:25,860
states. So it's a state in which certain connections are being severed in your mind,

1179
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:31,140
they're no longer active. Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction because

1180
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:37,380
some particular inhibition doesn't work anymore. And as a result, you might stop having a self,

1181
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:45,620
or you might stop perceiving the world as three-dimensional. And you can explore that

1182
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:50,820
state. And I suppose that for every state that can be induced with psychedelics, there are people

1183
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:56,340
that are naturally in that state. So sometimes psychedelics that shift you through a range of

1184
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:01,140
possible mental states, and they can also shift you out of the range of permissible mental states

1185
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:08,660
where you can make predictive models of reality. And what I observe in people that use psychedelics

1186
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:16,660
a lot is that they tend to be overfitting. Overfitting means that you are using more bits

1187
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:22,740
for modeling the dynamics of a function than you should. And so you can fit your curve to

1188
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:27,220
extremely detailed things in the past, but this model is no longer predictive for the future.

1189
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:33,780
What is it about psychedelics that forces that? I thought it would be the opposite. I thought

1190
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:44,340
it's a good mechanism for generalization, for regularization. So it feels like psychedelics

1191
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:51,620
expansion of the mind, like forcing your model to be non-predictive is a good thing.

1192
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:59,460
Meaning like, it's almost like, okay, what I would say psychedelics are akin to is traveling

1193
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:04,500
to a totally different environment. Like going, if you've never been to like India or something

1194
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:09,140
like that from the United States, very different set of people, different culture, different

1195
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:13,460
food, different roads and values and all those kinds of things.

1196
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:18,980
Yeah. So psychedelics can, for instance, teleport people into a universe that is

1197
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:25,700
hyperbolic, which means that if you imagine a room that you're in, you can turn around 360 degrees

1198
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,380
and you didn't go full circle. You need to go 20 degrees to go full circle.

1199
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,180
Exactly.

1200
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:35,220
So the things that people learn in that state cannot be easily transferred in this universe that

1201
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:40,340
we are in. It could be that if they're able to abstract and understand what happened to them,

1202
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:45,860
that they understand that some part of their spatial cognition has been desynchronized and

1203
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:49,380
has found a different synchronization. And this different synchronization happens

1204
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,060
to be a hyperbolic one, right? So you learn something interesting about your brain.

1205
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,740
It's difficult to understand what exactly happened, but we get a pretty good idea

1206
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:59,860
once we understand how the brain is representing geometry.

1207
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:03,620
Yeah, but doesn't give you a fresh perspective on the physical reality.

1208
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:12,100
Who's making that sound? Is it inside my head or is it external?

1209
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:19,780
Well, there is no sound outside of your mind, but it's making sense. Phenomena in physics.

1210
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:28,340
Yeah, in the physical reality, there's sound waves traveling through air. Okay.

1211
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,660
That's our model of what happened.

1212
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,580
That's our model of what happened. Right.

1213
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:41,140
Don't psychedelics give you a fresh perspective on this physical reality?

1214
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:44,740
Like, not this physical reality, but this more...

1215
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:51,940
What do you call the dream world that's mapped directly to...

1216
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:55,780
The purpose of dreaming at night, I think, is data augmentation.

1217
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:58,340
Well, exactly. So that's very different.

1218
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,540
That's very similar to psychedelics.

1219
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:02,740
So you basically exchange parameters about the things that you have learned.

1220
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:08,100
And for instance, when you are young, you have seen things from certain perspectives,

1221
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:13,540
but not from others. So your brain is generating new perspectives of objects that you already know,

1222
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:17,220
which means you can learn to recognize them later from different perspectives.

1223
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:21,780
And I suspect that's the reason that many of us remember to have flying dreams as children,

1224
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:25,060
because it's just different perspectives of the world that you already know.

1225
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:29,940
And that it starts to generate these different perspective changes.

1226
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:34,100
And then it fluidly turns this into a flying dream to make sense of what's happening.

1227
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,140
Right. So you fill in the gaps and suddenly you see yourself flying.

1228
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:40,900
And similar things can happen with semantic relationships.

1229
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:45,460
So it's not just spatial relationships, but it can also be the relationships between ideas

1230
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:50,980
that are being changed. And it seems that the mechanisms that make that happen during dreaming

1231
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:58,580
are interacting with these same receptors that are being simulated by psychedelics.

1232
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:03,540
So I suspect that there is a thing that I haven't read really about.

1233
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:09,940
The way in which dreams are induced in the brain is not just that the activity of the brain gets

1234
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:15,940
tuned down because your eyes are closed and you no longer get enough data from your eyes,

1235
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:21,780
but there is a particular type of neurotransmitter that is saturating your brain during these

1236
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:26,180
phases, during the RM phases, and you produce controlled hallucinations.

1237
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:31,380
And psychedelics are linking into these mechanisms, I suspect.

1238
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,100
So isn't that another trickier form of data augmentation?

1239
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:41,860
Yes. But it's also data augmentation that can happen outside of the specification

1240
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:45,460
that your brain is tuned to. So basically people are overclocking their brains

1241
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:50,580
and that produces states that are subjectively extremely interesting.

1242
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,580
But from the outside, very suspicious.

1243
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:59,300
I think I'm over-applying the metaphor of a neural network in my own mind,

1244
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:03,780
which I just think that doesn't lead to overfitting.

1245
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:10,740
But you were just sort of anecdotally saying my experiences with people that have no psychedelics

1246
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:13,620
are that kind of quality. I think it typically happens.

1247
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:19,060
So if you look at people like Timothy Leary, and he has written beautiful manifestos about

1248
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:24,900
the effect of LSD on people, he genuinely believed, he writes in these manifestos,

1249
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:29,300
that in the future, science and art will only be done on psychedelics because it's so much

1250
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:35,620
more efficient and so much better. And he gave LSD to children in this community of a few thousand

1251
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:43,220
people that he had near San Francisco. Basically, he was losing touch with reality. He did not

1252
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:48,660
understand the effects that the things that he was doing would have on the reception of psychedelics

1253
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:53,140
by society, because he was unable to think critically about what happened. What happened

1254
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:58,660
was that he got in a euphoric state. That euphoric state happened because he was overfitting.

1255
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:04,660
He was taking this sense of euphoria and translating it into a model of actual success

1256
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:11,540
in the world. He was feeling better. Limitations had disappeared that he experienced to be existing,

1257
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:14,500
but he didn't get superpowers. I understand what you mean by overfitting now.

1258
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:19,540
There's a lot of interpretation to the term overfitting in this case,

1259
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:26,500
but I got you. He was getting positive rewards from a lot of actions that he shouldn't have.

1260
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:32,260
Not just this. If you take, for instance, John Lilly, who was studying dolphin languages and

1261
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:36,900
aliens and so on, a lot of people that use psychedelics became very loopy.

1262
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:42,980
The typical thing that you notice when people are on psychedelics is that they are in a state

1263
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:47,940
where they feel that everything can be explained now. Everything is clear. Everything is obvious.

1264
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:54,660
Sometimes they have indeed discovered a useful connection, but not always. Very often,

1265
01:38:54,660 --> 01:39:01,540
these connections are overinterpretations. I wonder, there's a question of correlation

1266
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:07,140
versus causation. Also, I wonder if it's the psychedelics or if it's more the social,

1267
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:15,220
being the outsider and having a strong community of outsider and having a leadership position in

1268
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:20,500
and outside a cult-like community that could have a much stronger effect of overfitting than

1269
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:26,340
do psychedelics themselves, the actual substances, because it's a counterculture thing. It could be

1270
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:32,340
that as opposed to the actual substance. If you're a boring person who wears a suit and tie and

1271
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:39,140
works at a bank and takes psychedelics, that could be a very different effect of psychedelics on your

1272
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:44,900
mind. I'm just raising the point that the people you referenced are already weirdos.

1273
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:51,300
I'm not sure exactly. No, not necessarily. A lot of the people that tell me that they use psychedelics

1274
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:57,460
in a useful way started out as squares and were liberating themselves because they were stuck.

1275
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:02,180
They were basically stuck in local optimum of their own self-model, of their relationship to

1276
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:08,100
the world, and suddenly they had data augmentation. They basically saw and experienced a space of

1277
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:11,300
possibilities. They experienced what it would be like to be another person.

1278
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:15,700
That took important lessons from that experience back home.

1279
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:27,300
Yeah. I love the metaphor of data augmentation because that's been the primary driver of

1280
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:33,220
self-supervised learning in the computer vision domain, is data augmentation. It's funny to think

1281
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:40,420
of chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.

1282
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:48,820
There's also a very interesting effect that I noticed. I know several people who are severe

1283
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:57,300
to me that LSD has cured their migraines. Severe cluster headaches or migraines that didn't respond

1284
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:03,860
to standard medication that disappeared after a single dose. I don't recommend anybody doing this,

1285
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:09,460
especially not in the US where it's illegal. There are no studies on this for that reason,

1286
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:17,300
but it seems anecdotally that it basically can reset the serotonergic system. It's basically

1287
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:24,260
pushing them outside of their normal boundaries. As a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium.

1288
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:28,980
Some people's equilibrium is better, but it also follows that in other people it might be worse.

1289
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:34,340
If you have a brain that is already teetering on the boundary to psychosis,

1290
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:39,220
it can be permanently pushed over that boundary. That's why you have to do good science,

1291
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:42,660
which they're starting to do on all these different substances of how it actually works

1292
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:48,180
for the different conditions like MDMA seems to help with PTSD, same with psilocybin.

1293
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:53,140
You need to do good science, meaning large studies of large N.

1294
01:41:54,020 --> 01:42:00,180
Based on the existing studies with MDMA, it seems that if you look at Rick Doblin's work

1295
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:05,300
and what he has published about this and talks about, MDMA seems to be a psychologically

1296
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:12,740
relatively safe drug, but it's physiologically not very safe. That is, there is neurotoxicity if you

1297
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:19,060
use too large dose. If you combine this with alcohol, which a lot of kids do in party settings

1298
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:25,540
during raves and so on, it's very hepatotoxic. Basically, you can kill your liver. This means

1299
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:29,940
that it's probably something that is best and most productively used in a clinical setting

1300
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:34,660
by people who really know what they're doing. I suspect that's also true for

1301
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:39,700
the other psychedelics. That is, while the other psychedelics are probably not as toxic

1302
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:44,900
as, say, alcohol, the effects on the psyche can be much more profound and lasting.

1303
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:52,180
Yeah. Well, as far as I know psilocybin, so mushrooms, magic mushrooms, as far as I know

1304
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:57,780
in terms of the studies they're running, I think they're allowed to do what they're calling

1305
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:03,780
heroic doses. That one does not have a toxicity, so they can do huge doses in a clinical setting

1306
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:06,500
when they're doing study on psilocybin, which is kind of fun.

1307
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:12,900
Yeah. It seems that most of the psychedelics work in extremely small doses, which means that the

1308
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:18,980
effect on the rest of the body is relatively low. MDMA is probably the exception. Maybe ketamine

1309
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:25,700
can be dangerous in larger doses because it can depress breathing and so on. But the LSD and

1310
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:31,540
psilocybin work in very, very small doses, at least the active part of psilocybin LSD is only

1311
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:38,660
the active part. But the effect that it can have on your mental wiring can be very dangerous,

1312
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:45,860
I think. Let's talk about AI a little bit. What are your thoughts about GPT-3 and

1313
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,220
language models trained with self-supervised learning?

1314
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,300
It came out quite a bit ago, but I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

1315
01:43:55,300 --> 01:44:03,220
Yeah. In the 90s, I was in New Zealand and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten,

1316
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:09,860
who realized I was bored in class and put me in his lab. He gave me the task to discover

1317
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:15,860
grammatical structure in an unknown language. The unknown language that I picked was English

1318
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:21,780
because it was the easiest one to find a corpus for, a construct one. He gave me the largest

1319
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:26,740
computer at the whole university. It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing. I wrote

1320
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:33,460
everything in C with some in-memory compression to do statistics over the language. I first would

1321
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:39,140
create a dictionary of all the words, which basically tokenizes everything and compresses

1322
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:45,300
things so that I don't need to store the whole word, but just a code for every word. Then I was

1323
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:51,220
taking this all apart in sentences and I was trying to find all the relationships

1324
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:57,300
between all the words in the sentences and do statistics over them. That proved to be impossible

1325
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:02,820
because the complexity is just too large. If you want to discover the relationship between

1326
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:06,820
an article and a noun and there are three adjectives in between, you cannot do n-gram

1327
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:11,380
statistics and look at all the possibilities that can exist, at least not with the resources

1328
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:16,340
that we had back then. I realized I need to make some statistics over what I need to make

1329
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:23,220
statistics over. I wrote something that was pretty much a hack that did this for at least

1330
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:27,780
first-order relationships. I came up with some kind of mutual information graph that was indeed

1331
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:32,580
discovering something that looks exactly like the grammatical structure of the sentence,

1332
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:36,980
just by trying to encode the sentence in such a way that the words would be written in the

1333
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:44,660
optimal order inside of the model. What I also found is that if we would be able to increase

1334
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:50,980
the resolution of that and not just use this model to reproduce grammatically correct sentences,

1335
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:55,620
we would also be able to correct stylistically correct sentences by just having more bits in

1336
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:59,860
these relationships. If we wanted to have meaning, we would have to go much higher order.

1337
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:05,460
I didn't know how to make higher order models back then without spending way more years in

1338
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:09,540
research on how to make the statistics over what we need to make statistics over.

1339
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,980
This thing that we cannot look at the relationships between all the bits in your

1340
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:19,460
input is being solved in different domains in different ways. In computer graphics,

1341
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:25,620
computer vision, standard methods for many years now is convolutional neural networks.

1342
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:30,500
Convolutional neural networks are hierarchies of filters that exploit the fact that neighboring

1343
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:35,220
pixels in images are usually semantically related and distance pixels in images are

1344
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:41,140
usually not semantically related. You can just by grouping the pixels that are next to each other

1345
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:47,300
hierarchically together reconstruct the shape of objects. This is an important prior that we build

1346
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:52,660
into these models so they can converge quickly. But this doesn't work in language for the reason

1347
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:58,500
that adjacent words are often but not always related and distant words are sometimes related,

1348
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:03,860
while the words in between are not. How can you learn the topology of language?

1349
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:10,980
I think for this reason that this difficulty existed, the transformer was invented in

1350
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:18,100
natural language processing, not in vision. What the transformer is doing, it's a hierarchy of

1351
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:23,620
layers where every layer learns what to pay attention to in the given context in the previous

1352
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:32,420
layer. What to make the statistics over. The context is significantly larger than the

1353
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:40,820
adjacent word. Yes. The context that GPT-3 has been using, the transformer itself is from 2017 and

1354
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:47,780
it wasn't using that large of a context. OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea as far as they

1355
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:55,780
could at the time. The context is about 2048 symbols, tokens in the language. These symbols

1356
01:47:55,780 --> 01:48:02,180
are not characters, but they take the words and project them into a vector space, where words

1357
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:06,900
that are statistically co-occurring a lot are neighbors already. It's already a simplification

1358
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:12,100
of the problem a little bit. Every word is basically a set of coordinates in a high-dimensional

1359
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:18,420
space. Then they use some kind of trick to also encode the order of the words in a sentence,

1360
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:24,340
or in the not just sentence, but 2048 tokens is about couple pages of text or two and a half

1361
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:30,580
pages of text. They managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics over the potential relationships

1362
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:36,580
between two pages of text, which is tremendous. I was just using a single sentence back then,

1363
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:42,500
and I was only looking for first-order relationships, and they were really looking

1364
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:47,540
for much, much higher-level relationships. What they discover after they fed this with

1365
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:52,980
an enormous amount of training data, pretty much the written internet or the subset of it that

1366
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:59,860
had some quality, but substantial portion of the common draw, that they're not only able to reproduce

1367
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:05,860
style, but they're also able to reproduce some pretty detailed semantics like being able to add

1368
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:10,420
three-digit numbers and multiply two-digit numbers, or to translate between pro-angular

1369
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:16,180
languages and things like that. The results that GBT-3 got, I think, were amazing.

1370
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:21,700
By the way, I actually didn't check carefully. It's funny you just mentioned

1371
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:28,180
how you coupled semantics to the multiplication. Is it able to do some basic math on two-digit

1372
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:28,980
numbers? Yes.

1373
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:34,580
Okay. Interesting. I thought there's a lot of failure cases.

1374
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:39,780
It basically fails if you take larger-digit numbers, so four-digit numbers and so on

1375
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:45,940
makes carrying mistakes and so on. If you take larger numbers, you don't get useful results at

1376
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:54,260
all. This could be an issue of the training set. There are not many examples of successful

1377
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:57,700
long-form addition in standard human-written text.

1378
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:01,460
Humans aren't very good at doing three-digit numbers either.

1379
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:07,060
Yeah. You're not writing a lot about it. The other thing is that the loss function that is

1380
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:11,700
being used is only minimizing surprises. It's predicting what comes next in a typical text.

1381
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:15,060
It's not trying to go for causal closure first, as we do.

1382
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:23,540
Yeah. But the fact that that kind of prediction works to generate text that's semantically

1383
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:27,300
rich and consistent is interesting. Yeah.

1384
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:32,980
It's amazing that it's able to generate semantically consistent text.

1385
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:36,740
It's not consistent. The problem is that it loses coherence at some point,

1386
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:43,380
but it's also, I think, not correct to say that GPT-3 is unable to deal with semantics at all

1387
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:47,460
because you ask it to perform certain transformations in text, and it performs

1388
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:52,260
these transformations in text. The kind of additions that it's able to perform are

1389
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:57,380
transformations in text. There are proper semantics involved.

1390
01:50:57,380 --> 01:51:03,780
You can also do more. There was a paper that was generating lots and lots of mathematically

1391
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:10,980
correct text and was feeding this into a transformer. As a result, it was able to

1392
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:15,940
learn how to do differentiation integration in race that, according to the authors,

1393
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:22,820
Mathematica could not. To which some of the people in Mathematica responded that they were

1394
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:27,860
not using Mathematica in the right way and so on. I have not really followed the resolution of this

1395
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:33,860
conflict. This part, as a small tangent, I really don't like in machine learning papers, which

1396
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:42,580
they often do anecdotal evidence. They'll find one example in some specific use of Mathematica

1397
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:48,500
and demonstrate, look, they'll show successes and failures, but they won't have a very clear

1398
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:53,300
representation of how many cases this actually represents. But I think as a first paper,

1399
01:51:53,300 --> 01:52:00,500
this is a pretty good start. The take-home message, I think, is that the authors could

1400
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:05,220
get better results from this and their experiments than they could get from the

1401
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:10,420
way in which they were using computer algebra systems, which means that was not nothing.

1402
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:18,180
It's able to perform substantially better than GPTSV can based on a much larger amount of training

1403
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:24,980
data using the same underlying algorithm. Let me ask, again, so I'm using your tweets as if

1404
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:33,060
this is like Play-Doh, as if this is well thought out novels that you've written.

1405
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:43,860
You tweeted, GPT-4 is listening to us now. This is one way of asking, what are the limitations of

1406
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:52,500
GPT-3 when it scales? What do you think will be the capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-5, and so on? What

1407
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:57,620
are the limits of this approach? Obviously, when we are writing things right now, everything that

1408
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:02,260
we are writing now is going to be training data for the next generation of machine learning models.

1409
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:07,700
Yes, of course, GPT-4 is listening to us. I think the tweet is already a little bit older,

1410
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:14,100
and we now have Voodoo, and we have a number of other systems that basically are placeholders

1411
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:21,380
for GPT-4. I don't know what open AIS plans are in this regard. I read that tweet in several ways.

1412
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:26,020
One is, obviously, everything you put on the internet has used this training data,

1413
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:36,020
but in a second way I read it is we talked about agency. I read it as almost like GPT-4 is

1414
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:44,100
intelligent enough to be choosing to listen. Not only did a programmer tell it to collect this data

1415
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:50,820
and use it for training, I almost saw the humorous angle, which is like it has achieved AGI kind of

1416
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:59,380
thing. Well, the thing is, could we already be living in GPT-5? GPT-4 is listening, and

1417
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:04,020
GPT-5 is actually constructing the entirety of the reality. Of course, in some sense,

1418
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:09,300
what everybody is trying to do right now in AI is to extend the transformer to be able to deal

1419
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:18,020
with video. There are very promising extensions. There is a work by Google that is called Perceiver,

1420
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:24,500
and that is overcoming some of the limitations of the transformer by letting it learn the topology

1421
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:32,100
of the different modalities separately and by training it to find better input features.

1422
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:39,700
So the specific feature abstractions that are being used by this successor to GPT-3 are chosen

1423
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:45,380
in such a way that it's able to deal with video input. There is more to be done. One of the

1424
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:52,180
limitations of GPT-3 is that it's amnesiac, so it forgets everything beyond the two pages that

1425
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:57,780
it currently reads, also during generation, not just during learning. Do you think that's fixable

1426
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:03,380
within the space of deep learning? Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?

1427
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:08,900
No, I don't think that our own working memory is infinitely large. It's probably also just a few

1428
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:15,140
thousand bits, but what you can do is you can structure this working memory. So instead of just

1429
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:21,540
force-feeding a certain thing that it has to focus on, and it's not allowed to focus on anything else

1430
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:27,860
with its network, you allow it to construct its own working memory, as we do. When we are reading

1431
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:33,380
a book, it's not that we are focusing our attention in such a way that we can only remember the current

1432
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:39,540
page. We will also try to remember other pages and try to undo what we learn from them or modify

1433
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:43,940
what we learn from them. We might get up and take another book from the shelf. We might go out and

1434
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:50,740
ask somebody. We can edit our working memory in any way that is useful to put a context together

1435
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:56,820
that allows us to draw the right inferences and to learn the right things. So this ability to

1436
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:03,140
perform experiments on the world based on an attempt to become fully coherent and to achieve

1437
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:08,900
causal closure, to achieve a certain aesthetic of your modeling, that is something that eventually

1438
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:14,580
needs to be done. At the moment, we are skirting this in some sense by building systems that are

1439
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:19,380
larger and faster so they can use dramatically larger resources than human beings can do and

1440
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:24,740
much more training data to get to models that in some sense are already very superhuman and in

1441
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:32,100
other ways are laughingly incoherent. So do you think sort of making the systems like,

1442
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:40,020
what would you say, multi-resolutional, so like some of the language models are focused on

1443
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:48,660
two pages, some are focused on two books, some are focused on two years of reading,

1444
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:54,020
some are focused on a lifetime. So it's like stacks of GPT-3s all the way down.

1445
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:59,140
You want to have gaps in between them. So it's not necessarily two years, there's no gaps,

1446
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:04,260
it's things out of two years or out of 20 years or 2,000 years or 2 billion years,

1447
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:09,540
that you are just selecting those bits that are predicted to be the most useful ones

1448
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:14,020
to understand what you're currently doing. And this prediction itself requires a very

1449
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:17,940
complicated model and that's the actual model that you need to be making. It's not just that

1450
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:21,940
you are trying to understand the relationships between things, but what you need to make

1451
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:27,540
discover relationships over. I wonder what that thing looks like,

1452
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:31,300
what the architecture for the thing that's able to have that kind of model.

1453
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:37,860
I think it needs more degrees of freedom than the current models have. So it starts out with the

1454
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:43,460
fact that you possibly don't just want to have a feedforward model, but you want it to be fully

1455
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:48,900
recurrent. And to make it fully recurrent, you probably need to loop it back into itself and

1456
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:54,420
allow it to skip connections. Once you do this, when you're predicting the next frame and your

1457
01:57:54,420 --> 01:58:01,220
internal next frame in every moment, and you are able to skip connection, it means that signals can

1458
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:08,100
travel from the output of the network into the middle of the network faster than the inputs do.

1459
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:12,820
Do you think it can still be differentiable? Do you think it still can be in your own network?

1460
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:17,620
Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot. So it can still be in your own network,

1461
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:22,980
but not a fully differentiable one. And when you want to deal with non-differentiable ones,

1462
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:27,620
you need to have an attention system that is discrete and two-dimensional and can perform

1463
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:32,260
grammatical operations. You need to be able to perform program synthesis. You need to be able

1464
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:37,460
to backtrack in these operations that you perform on this thing. This thing needs a model of what

1465
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:41,780
it's currently doing. And I think this is exactly the purpose of our own consciousness.

1466
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:48,340
Yeah. The program things that trickle in your own networks. So let me ask you, it's not quite

1467
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:55,380
program synthesis, but the application of these language models to generation, to program synthesis,

1468
01:58:55,380 --> 01:59:01,460
but generation of programs. So if you look at GitHub OpenPilot, which is based on OpenAI's codecs,

1469
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:06,260
I don't know if you got a chance to look at it, but it's the system that's able to generate code

1470
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:12,260
once you prompt it with, what is it? Like the header of a function with some comments,

1471
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:19,060
and it seems to do an incredibly good job or not a perfect job, which is very important,

1472
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:24,580
but an incredibly good job of generating functions. What do you make of that? Are you,

1473
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:30,100
is this exciting or is this just a party trick, a demo, or is this revolutionary?

1474
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:39,220
I haven't worked with this yet, so it's difficult for me to judge it, but I would not be surprised

1475
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:44,020
if it turns out to be revolutionary. And that's because the majority of programming tasks that

1476
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:49,460
are being done in the industry right now are not creative. People are writing code that other

1477
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:53,700
people have written, or they're putting things together from code fragments that others have had.

1478
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:59,460
And a lot of the work that programmers do in practice is to figure out how to overcome

1479
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:03,060
the gaps in their current knowledge in the things that people have already done.

1480
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:06,180
How to copy and paste from Stack Overflow, that's right.

1481
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:08,580
And so of course we can automate that.

1482
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:12,980
Yeah, to make it much faster to copy and paste from Stack Overflow.

1483
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:17,220
Yes, but it's not just copying and pasting, it's also basically learning which parts you need to

1484
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:22,980
modify to make them fit together. Yeah, like literally sometimes as

1485
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:27,140
simple as just changing the variable names so it fits into the rest of your code.

1486
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:30,820
Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics of what you're doing to some degree.

1487
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:35,780
Yeah, and you can automate some of those things. The thing that makes people nervous of course is

1488
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:42,900
that a little bit wrong in a program can have a dramatic effect on the actual

1489
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:49,780
final operation of that program. So like one little error, which in the space of language

1490
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:54,100
doesn't really matter, but in the space of programs can matter a lot.

1491
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:57,940
Yes, but this is already what is happening when humans program code.

1492
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:01,620
Yeah. So we have a technology to deal with this.

1493
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:08,180
Somehow it becomes scarier when you know that a program generated code that's running a nuclear

1494
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:12,900
power plant. It becomes scarier. You know humans have errors too.

1495
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:17,620
Exactly. But it's scarier when a program is doing it because

1496
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:30,100
why? I mean there's a fear that a program may not be as good as humans

1497
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:40,340
to know when stuff is important to not mess up. There's a misalignment of priorities,

1498
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:44,900
of values, that's potential. Maybe that's the source of the worry.

1499
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:54,580
I mean, okay, if I give you code generated by GitHub OpenPilot and code generated by a human

1500
02:01:54,580 --> 02:02:02,420
and say, here, use one of these. How do you select today and in the next 10 years

1501
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:05,700
which code to use? Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human?

1502
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:14,020
At the moment, when you go to Stanford to get an MRI, they will write a bill to the insurance

1503
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:21,220
over $20,000. And of this, maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance and a quarter gets

1504
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:29,140
paid by you. And the MRI costs them $600 to make maybe, probably less. And what are the values of

1505
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:36,100
the person that writes the software and deploys this process? It's very difficult for me to say

1506
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:43,700
whether I trust people. I think that what happens there is a mixture of proper Anglo-Saxon Protestant

1507
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:48,340
values where somebody is trying to serve an abstract rate of whole and organized crime.

1508
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:59,540
Well, that's a very harsh. I think that's a harsh view of humanity. There's a lot of bad people,

1509
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:05,700
whether incompetent or just malevolent in this world, yes. But it feels like the more

1510
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:13,540
malevolent, so the more damage you do to the world, the more resistance you have in your own

1511
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:20,820
human heart. But don't explain with malevolence or stupidity what can be explained by just people

1512
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:26,420
acting on their incentives. So what happens in Stanford is not that somebody is evil,

1513
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:29,860
it's just that they do what they're being paid for.

1514
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:41,780
No, it's not evil. I see that as malevolence. I see even being a good German, as I told you

1515
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:49,860
offline, it's not absolute malevolence, but it's a small amount. It's cowardice. I mean,

1516
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:55,380
when you see there's something wrong with the world, it's either incompetence that you're

1517
02:03:55,380 --> 02:04:01,700
not able to see it, or it's cowardice that you're not able to stand up, not necessarily in a big

1518
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:09,060
way, but in a small way. So I do think that is a bit of malevolence. I'm not sure the example

1519
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:12,660
you're describing is a good example of that. So the question is, what is it that you are aiming

1520
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:18,820
for? And if you don't believe in the future, if you, for instance, think that the dollar is

1521
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:24,660
going to crash by what you try to save dollars, if you don't think that humanity will be around

1522
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:30,180
in 100 years from now because global warming will wipe out civilization, why would you need

1523
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:37,620
to act as if it were? So the question is, is there an overarching aesthetics that is projecting you

1524
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:42,420
and the world into the future, which I think is the basic idea of religion, that you understand

1525
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:47,060
the interactions that we have with each other as some kind of civilization level agent that is

1526
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:54,180
projecting itself into the future. If you don't have that shared purpose, what is there to be

1527
02:04:54,180 --> 02:05:00,980
ethical for? So I think when we talk about ethics and AI, we need to go beyond the insane bias

1528
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:06,180
discussions and so on, where people are just measuring the distance between a statistic to

1529
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:12,180
their preferred current world model. But the optimism... Wait, wait, wait. I was a little

1530
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:23,540
confused by the previous thing, just to clarify. There is a kind of underlying morality to having

1531
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:30,340
an optimism that human civilization will persist for longer than 100 years. I think a lot of people

1532
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:36,980
believe that it's a good thing for us to keep living and thriving. Yeah, of course. This morality

1533
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:44,260
itself is not an end to itself. It's instrumental to people living in 100 years from now or 500

1534
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:50,740
years from now. So it's only justifiable if you actually think that it will lead to people or

1535
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:56,100
increase the probability of people being around in that timeframe. And a lot of people don't

1536
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:02,660
actually believe that, at least not actively. But believe what exactly? Most people don't believe

1537
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:07,860
that they can afford to act on such a model. Basically, what happens in the US is I think

1538
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:12,020
that the healthcare system is for a lot of people no longer sustainable, which means that if they

1539
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:16,740
need the help of the healthcare system, they're often not able to afford it. And when they cannot

1540
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:22,500
help it, they are often going bankrupt. I think the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the

1541
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:28,820
US is the healthcare system. And that would not be necessary. It's not because people are consuming

1542
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:34,180
more and more medical services and are achieving a much, much longer life as a result. That's not

1543
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:37,860
actually the story that is happening because you can compare it to other countries. And

1544
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:42,020
life expectancy in the US is currently not increasing and it's not as high as in all the

1545
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:45,860
other industrialized countries. So some industrialized countries are doing better

1546
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:51,460
with a much cheaper healthcare system. And what you can see is, for instance, administrative

1547
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:59,380
load. The healthcare system has maybe to some degree deliberately set up a job placement program

1548
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:08,020
to allow people to continue living a middle-class existence despite not having a useful use case in

1549
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:13,540
productivity. So they are being paid to push paper around. And the number of administrators

1550
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:17,860
in the healthcare system has been increasing much faster than the number of practitioners.

1551
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:23,300
And this is something that you have to pay for. And also the revenues that are being generated

1552
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:28,020
in the healthcare system are relatively large and somebody has to pay for them. And the result why

1553
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:34,340
they are so large is because market mechanisms are not working. The FDA is largely not protecting

1554
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:40,900
people from malpractice of healthcare providers. The FDA is protecting healthcare providers from

1555
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:46,980
competition. So this is a thing that has to do with values. And this is not because people are

1556
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:53,140
malicious on all levels. It's because they are not incentivized to act on a greater whole on this

1557
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:57,780
idea that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient like you would treat a family member.

1558
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:03,300
Yeah. But you're highlighting a lot of the flaws of the different institutions,

1559
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:07,300
the systems we're operating under. But I think there's a continued throughout history

1560
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:13,780
mechanism design of trying to design incentives in such a way that these systems behave better

1561
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:18,980
and better and better. I mean, it's a very difficult thing to operate a society of hundreds

1562
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:24,580
of millions of people effectively with- Yes. So do we live in a society that is ever correcting?

1563
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:32,420
Do we observe that our models of what we are doing are predictive of the future and when they are not,

1564
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:38,100
we improve them. Our laws are adjudicated with clauses that you put into every law,

1565
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:42,100
what is meant to be achieved by that law, and the law will be automatically repealed

1566
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:46,340
if it's not achieving that. If you are optimizing your own laws, if you're writing your own source

1567
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:51,460
code, you probably make an estimate of what is this thing that's currently wrong in my life?

1568
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:55,620
What is it that I should change about my own policies? What is the expected outcome?

1569
02:08:56,180 --> 02:09:01,220
And if that outcome doesn't manifest, I will change the policy back or I would change it

1570
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:04,260
into something different. Are we doing this on a societal level?

1571
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:09,700
I think so. I think it's easy to highlight. I think we're doing it in the way that

1572
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:16,340
I operate my current life. I didn't sleep much last night. You would say that,

1573
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:19,780
Lex, the way you need to operate your life is you need to always get sleep. The fact that you

1574
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:26,740
didn't sleep last night is totally the wrong way to operate in your life. You should have gotten

1575
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:31,780
all your shit done in time and gotten to sleep because sleep is very important for health,

1576
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:37,780
and you're highlighting, look, this person is not sleeping. Look, the medical, the healthcare system

1577
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:43,460
is operating poor. But the point is, it seems like this is the way, especially in the capitalist

1578
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:50,500
society we operate, we keep running into trouble and last minute we try to get our way out through

1579
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:56,100
innovation, and it seems to work. You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying to

1580
02:09:56,100 --> 02:10:04,340
build a better world and get urgency about them when the problem becomes more and more imminent,

1581
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:12,740
and that's the way this operates. But if you look at the long arc of history, it seems like that

1582
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:19,060
operating on deadlines produces progress and builds better and better systems.

1583
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:26,100
You probably agree with me that the US should have engaged in mass production in January 2020

1584
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:33,060
and that we should have shut down the airports early and that we should have made it mandatory

1585
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:40,020
that the people that work in nursing homes live on campus rather than living at home

1586
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:45,060
and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes that had no immune response to

1587
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:51,380
COVID. That is something that was, I think, visible back then. The correct decisions haven't

1588
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:56,660
been made. We would have the same situation again. How do we know that these wrong decisions are not

1589
02:10:56,660 --> 02:11:01,380
being made again? Have the people that made the decisions to not protect the nursing homes been

1590
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:07,860
punished? Have the people that made the wrong decisions with respect to testing that prevented

1591
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:12,980
the development of testing by startup companies and the importing of tests from countries that

1592
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:18,260
already had them? Have these people been held responsible? First of all, what do you want to

1593
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:23,860
put before the firing squad? No, just make sure that this doesn't happen again.

1594
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:29,940
But it's not that, yes, they're being held responsible by many voices, by people being

1595
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:35,940
frustrated. There's new leaders being born now that are going to see rise to the top in 10 years.

1596
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:43,300
This moves slower than, there's obviously a lot of older incompetence in bureaucracy

1597
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:50,580
and these systems move slowly. They move like science, one death at a time. So yes,

1598
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:57,620
I think the pain that's been felt in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world.

1599
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:01,220
Maybe I'm getting old. I suspect that every generation in the US

1600
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:05,300
after the war has lost the plot even more. I don't see this development.

1601
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:08,820
The war, World War II? Yeah. So basically, there was a time

1602
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:16,020
when we were modernist. And in this modernist time, the US felt actively threatened by the

1603
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:20,660
things that happened in the world. The US was worried about possibility of failure.

1604
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:29,060
And this imminence of possible failure led to decisions. There was a time when the government

1605
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:34,420
would listen to physicists about how to do things. And the physicists were actually concerned about

1606
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:38,180
what the government should be doing. So they would be writing letters to the government.

1607
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:42,340
And so for instance, the decision for the Manhattan Project was something that was

1608
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:46,100
driven in a conversation between physicists and the government.

1609
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,980
I don't think such a discussion would take place today.

1610
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:54,740
I disagree. I think if the virus was much deadlier, we would see a very different response.

1611
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:59,540
I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly. And instead, because it wasn't very deadly,

1612
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:06,100
what happened is the current system started to politicize it. This is what I realized with

1613
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:12,980
masks early on. They very quickly became not as a solution, but they became a thing

1614
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:18,420
that politicians used to divide the country. So the same things happened with vaccines.

1615
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:24,340
People weren't talking about solutions to this problem because I don't think the problem was

1616
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:29,860
bad enough. When you talk about the war, I think our lives are too comfortable.

1617
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:36,500
I think in the developed world, things are too good and we have not faced severe dangers.

1618
02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:42,900
When the severe dangers, existential threats are faced, that's when we step up,

1619
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:51,540
on a small scale and a large scale. Now, that's sort of my argument here, but I did think the

1620
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:59,300
virus... I was hoping that it was actually sufficiently dangerous for us to step up,

1621
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:04,420
because especially in the early days, it was unclear. It still is unclear because of mutations

1622
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:16,580
how bad it might be. So I thought we would step up. The masks point is a tricky one because

1623
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:22,340
to me, the manufacture of masks isn't even the problem. I'm still to this day, and I was

1624
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:27,860
involved with a bunch of this work, have not seen good signs done on whether masks work or not.

1625
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:34,420
There still has not been a large scale study. To me, there should be large scale studies on every

1626
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:39,780
possible solution, aggressive in the same way that the vaccine development was aggressive.

1627
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:47,540
There should be masks, what kind of tests work really well. Even the question of how the virus

1628
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:54,740
spreads. There should be aggressive studies on that to understand. As far as I know, there's still

1629
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:59,620
a lot of uncertainty about that. Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem that needs to

1630
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:06,660
be solved. That I was surprised about. I find that our views are largely convergent,

1631
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:12,660
but not completely. So I agree with the thing that because our society in some sense perceives

1632
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:18,980
itself as too big to fail, and the virus did not alert people to the fact that we are facing

1633
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:24,340
possible failure, that basically put us into the postmodernist mode. And I don't mean in

1634
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:30,020
the philosophical sense, but in a societal sense. The difference between the postmodern society

1635
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:34,420
and the modern society is that the modernist society has to deal with the ground truth,

1636
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:39,380
and the postmodernist society has to deal with appearances. Politics becomes a performance,

1637
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:44,340
and the performance is done for an audience, and the organized audience is the media,

1638
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:50,100
and the media evaluates itself via other media. So you have an audience of critics that evaluate

1639
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:54,500
themselves. And I don't think it's so much the failure of the politicians, because to get in

1640
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:59,620
power and to stay in power, you need to be able to deal with the published opinion.

1641
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:05,380
Well, I think it goes into cycles, because what's going to happen is all of the small

1642
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:10,500
business owners, all the people who truly are suffering and will suffer more because of the

1643
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:17,460
effects of the closure of the economy and the lack of solutions to the virus, they're going to

1644
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:24,660
apprise. And hopefully, I mean, this is where charismatic leaders can get the world in trouble,

1645
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:33,380
but hopefully will elect great leaders that will break through this postmodernist idea of

1646
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:39,780
the media and the perception and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of stuff.

1647
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:44,900
But you know, this can go either way. When the Weimar Republic was unable to

1648
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:51,060
deal with the economic crisis that Germany was facing, there was an option to go back.

1649
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:56,020
And there were people which thought, let's get back to a constitutional

1650
02:16:56,020 --> 02:17:02,020
monarchy and let's get this to work, because democracy doesn't work. And eventually,

1651
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:06,580
there was no way back. People decided there was no way back. They needed to go forward.

1652
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:13,940
And the only options for going forward was to become Stalinist communists, basically an

1653
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:20,420
option to completely expropriate the factories and so on and nationalize them and to reorganize

1654
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:28,660
Germany in communist terms and ally itself with Stalin and fascism. And both options were obviously

1655
02:17:28,660 --> 02:17:35,700
very bad. And the one that the Germans picked led to a catastrophe that devastated Europe.

1656
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:41,380
And I'm not sure if the US has an immune response against that. I think that the

1657
02:17:41,380 --> 02:17:44,900
far right is currently very weak in the US, but this can easily change.

1658
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:52,020
Do you think from a historical perspective, Hitler could have been stopped

1659
02:17:52,980 --> 02:17:59,940
from within Germany or from outside? Or this? Well, it depends on who you want to focus,

1660
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:03,780
whether you want to focus on Stalin or Hitler. But it feels like Hitler was the one

1661
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,420
as a political movement that could have been stopped.

1662
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:13,620
I think that the point was that a lot of people wanted Hitler. So he got support from a lot of

1663
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:18,340
quarters. There was a number of industrialists who supported him because they thought that the

1664
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:23,940
democracy is obviously not working and unstable and you need a strongman. And he was willing to

1665
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:30,580
play that part. There were also people in the US who thought that Hitler would stop Stalin and

1666
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:37,700
would act as a bulwark against Bolshevism, which he probably would have done at which cost.

1667
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:45,300
And then many of the things that he was going to do, like the Holocaust, was something where

1668
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:50,660
people thought this is rhetoric. He's not actually going to do this, especially many of the Jews

1669
02:18:50,660 --> 02:18:55,380
themselves, which were humanists. And for them, this was outside of the scope that was thinkable.

1670
02:18:55,380 --> 02:19:05,060
Right. I wonder if Hitler is uniquely, I want to carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.

1671
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:14,020
So if Hitler was never born, if somebody else would come in this place. So just thinking about

1672
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:21,540
the progress of history, how important are those singular figures that lead to mass destruction

1673
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:31,460
and cruelty? Because my sense is Hitler was unique. It wasn't just about the environment

1674
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:38,580
and the context that gave him. Another person would not come in his place to do as destructive

1675
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:45,700
of the things that he did. There was a combination of charisma, of madness, of

1676
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:52,740
psychopathy, of just ego, all those things, which are very unlikely to come together in one person

1677
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:57,860
in the right time. It also depends on the context of the country that you're operating in.

1678
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:05,940
If you tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny in this romantic country,

1679
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:13,940
the effect is probably different than it is in other countries. But Stalin has killed a few more

1680
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:19,460
people than Hitler did. And if you look at the probability that you survived under Stalin,

1681
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:28,900
Hitler killed people if he thought they were not worth living or if they were harmful to his

1682
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:35,620
racist project. Basically, he felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan and would not be willing

1683
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:42,500
to participate in the racist redefinition of society and the value of society and an ethno-state

1684
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:49,540
in this way, as he wanted it to have it. So he saw them as harmful danger, especially

1685
02:20:49,540 --> 02:20:54,740
since they played such an important role in the economy and culture of Germany.

1686
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:04,740
Basically, he had some radical but rational reason to murder them, and Stalin just killed everyone.

1687
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:09,220
He basically, the Stalinist churches were such a random thing where he said that there's a

1688
02:21:12,660 --> 02:21:18,340
certain possibility that this particular part of the population has a number of German collaborators

1689
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:23,700
or something, and we just killed them all. Or if you look at what Mao did, the number of

1690
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:28,740
people that were killed in absolute numbers were much higher under Mao than they were under Stalin.

1691
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:35,700
So it's super hard to say. The other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on,

1692
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:42,900
how many people he killed. There are a number of things that happen in human history that actually

1693
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:50,500
really put a substantial dent in the existing population, or Napoleon. And it's very difficult

1694
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:57,860
to eventually measure it because what's happening is basically evolution on a human scale for one

1695
02:21:57,860 --> 02:22:05,300
monkey figures out a way to become viral and is using this viral technology to change the

1696
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:12,020
patterns of society at the very, very large scale. And what we find so abhorrent about these changes

1697
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:17,060
is the complexity that is being destroyed by this. That it's basically like a big fire that burns out

1698
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:20,020
a lot of the existing culture and structure that existed before.

1699
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:27,460
Yeah. And it all just starts with one monkey, one charismatic ape, and there's a bunch of them

1700
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:32,260
throughout history. Yeah. But it's in a given environment. It's basically similar to wildfires

1701
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:38,420
in California, right? The temperature is rising. There is less rain falling. And then suddenly a

1702
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:45,460
single spark can have an effect that in other times would be contained. Okay. Speaking of which,

1703
02:22:45,460 --> 02:22:55,700
I love how we went to Hitler and Stalin from 20, 30 minutes ago, GPT-3 doing program synthesis.

1704
02:22:55,700 --> 02:23:07,460
The argument was about morality of AI versus human. And specifically in the context of

1705
02:23:07,460 --> 02:23:12,580
writing programs, specifically in the context of programs that can be destructive. So running

1706
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:20,980
nuclear power plants or autonomous weapons systems, for example. And I think your inclination was to

1707
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:27,620
say that it's not so obvious that AI would be less moral than humans or less effective at making

1708
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:35,220
a world that would make humans happy. So I'm not talking about self-directed systems that are

1709
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:42,020
making their own goals at a global scale. If you just talk about the deployment of technological

1710
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:48,500
systems that are able to see order and patterns and use this as control models to act on the

1711
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:54,420
goals that we give them, then if we have the correct incentives to set the correct incentives

1712
02:23:54,420 --> 02:24:00,980
for these systems, I'm quite optimistic. So humans versus AI. Let me give you an example.

1713
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:09,620
Autonomous weapons system. Let's say there's a city somewhere in the Middle East that has

1714
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:17,060
a number of terrorists. And the question is what's currently done with drone technologies,

1715
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:22,180
you have information about the location of a particular terrorist and you have a targeted

1716
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:28,100
attack, you have a bombing of that particular building. And that's all directed by humans at

1717
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:35,300
the high level strategy and also at the deployment of individual bombs and missiles. Everything is

1718
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:43,380
done by human except the final targeting and the spot, similar thing like control the flight.

1719
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:51,460
Okay. What if you give AI control and saying, write a program that says,

1720
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:56,340
here's the best information I have available about the location of these five terrorists.

1721
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:02,180
Here's the city. Make sure all the bombing you do is constrained to the city. Make sure it's

1722
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:08,260
precision based, but you take care of it. So you do one level of abstraction out and saying,

1723
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:15,220
take care of the terrorists in the city. Which are you more comfortable with, the humans or the

1724
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:24,500
JavaScript GPT-3 generated code that's doing the deployment? This is the kind of question I'm asking

1725
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:31,540
is the kind of bugs that we see in human nature, are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we

1726
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:38,100
see in AI? They're different bugs. There is an issue that if people are creating

1727
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:44,420
imperfect automation of a process that normally requires a moral judgment,

1728
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:51,140
and this moral judgment is the reason why it cannot be automated often. It's not because

1729
02:25:51,140 --> 02:25:57,620
the computation is too expensive, but because the model that you give the AI is not an adequate

1730
02:25:57,620 --> 02:26:02,180
model of the dynamics of the world because the AI does not understand the context that it's

1731
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:06,820
operating in the right way. And this is something that already happens with Excel,

1732
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:12,420
you don't need to have an AI system to do this. You have an automated process in place

1733
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:18,180
where humans decide using automated criteria whom to kill when and whom to target when,

1734
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:23,700
which already happens. And you have no way to get off the kill list once that happens,

1735
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:28,740
once you have been targeted according to some automatic criterion by people in a bureaucracy.

1736
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:33,700
That is the issue. The issue is not the AI, it's the automation.

1737
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:39,460
So there's something about, right, it's automation, but there's something about

1738
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:45,780
there's a certain level of abstraction where you give control to AI to do the automation.

1739
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:52,900
There's a scale that can be achieved that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake

1740
02:26:52,900 --> 02:27:00,100
and scale of destruction that can be achieved of the kind that humans cannot achieve. So AI is

1741
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:05,940
much more able to destroy an entire country accidentally versus humans. It feels like the

1742
02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:14,100
more civilians die as a react or suffer as the consequences of your decisions, the more weight

1743
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:21,700
there is on the human mind to make that decision. And so it becomes more and more unlikely to make

1744
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:28,340
that decision for humans. For AI, it feels like it's harder to encode that kind of weight.

1745
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:35,220
In a way, the AI that we're currently building is automating statistics. Intelligence is the ability

1746
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:41,540
to make models so you can act on them. And AI is a tool to make better models. So in principle,

1747
02:27:41,540 --> 02:27:48,900
if you're using AI wisely, you're able to prevent more harm. And I think that the main issue is not

1748
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:53,380
on the side of the AI, it's on the side of the human command hierarchy that is using technology

1749
02:27:53,380 --> 02:28:00,580
irresponsibly. So the question is how hard is it to properly encode the right incentives into the

1750
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:06,580
AI? So for instance, there's this idea of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown

1751
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:12,340
with AI systems and the neural network is a black box and so on. And it turns out our neural networks

1752
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:18,740
are actually not black boxes anymore. There are function approximators using linear algebra,

1753
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:23,380
and there are performing things that we can understand. But we can also,

1754
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:27,780
instead of letting the neural network fly the airplane, use the neural network to generate

1755
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:32,820
a proven to be correct program. There's a degree of accuracy of the proof that a human could not

1756
02:28:32,820 --> 02:28:38,820
achieve. And so we can use our AI by combining different technologies to build systems that are

1757
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:45,380
much more reliable than the systems that a human being could create. And so in this sense, I would

1758
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:53,460
say that if you use an early stage of technology to save labor and don't employ competent people,

1759
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:58,020
but just to hack something together because you can, that is very dangerous. And if people are

1760
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:04,100
acting under these incentives that they get away with delivering shoddy work more cheaply using AI

1761
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:07,220
is less human oversight than before. That's very dangerous.

1762
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:12,500
The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable, perhaps less so than humans,

1763
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:19,300
but it'll be unreliable in novel ways. And- Yeah, but this is an empirical question

1764
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:25,220
and it's something that we can figure out and work with. So the issue is, do we trust the systems,

1765
02:29:25,220 --> 02:29:30,100
the social systems that we have in place and the social systems that we can build and maintain

1766
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:36,180
that they're able to use AI responsibly? If they can, then AI is good news. If they cannot,

1767
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:38,260
then it's going to make the existing problems worse.

1768
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:43,300
Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it, who makes money from it,

1769
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:48,980
because it's ultimately humans. And then you start talking about how much you trust the humans.

1770
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:54,260
So the question is, what does who mean? I don't think that we have identity per se. I think that

1771
02:29:54,260 --> 02:30:00,180
the story of a human being is somewhat random. What happens is more or less that everybody is

1772
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:04,820
acting on their local incentives, what they're perceived to be their incentives. And the question

1773
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:10,740
is, what are the incentives that the one that is pressing the button is operating under?

1774
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:16,740
Yeah. It's nice for those incentives to be transparent. So for example,

1775
02:30:18,180 --> 02:30:26,500
there seems to be a significant distrust of tech, like entrepreneurs in the tech space

1776
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:30,900
or people that run, for example, social media companies like Mark Zuckerberg.

1777
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:38,420
There is not a complete transparency of incentives under which that particular human being operates.

1778
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:44,900
We can listen to the words he says or what the marketing team says for a company,

1779
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:51,620
but we don't know. And that becomes a problem when the algorithms and the systems created by

1780
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:58,420
him and other people in that company start having more and more impact on society.

1781
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:07,460
And if the incentives were somehow, the definition and the explainability of the

1782
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:16,340
incentives was decentralized such that nobody can manipulate it. No propaganda type manipulation

1783
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:24,660
of how these systems actually operate could be done. Then yes, I think AI could achieve

1784
02:31:25,220 --> 02:31:35,860
a much fairer, much more effective solutions to difficult ethical problems. But when there's

1785
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:42,660
like humans in the loop manipulating the dissemination, the communication of how the

1786
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:47,620
system actually works, that feels like you can run into a lot of trouble. And that's why there's

1787
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:53,380
currently a lot of distrust for people at the heads of companies that have increasingly powerful

1788
02:31:53,780 --> 02:32:00,980
AI systems. I suspect what happened traditionally in the US was that since our decision-making is

1789
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:06,900
much more decentralized than in an authoritarian state, people are making decisions autonomously

1790
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:13,060
at many, many levels in society. What happened that was we created coherence and cohesion in

1791
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:19,380
society by controlling what people thought and what information they had. The media synchronized

1792
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:25,380
public opinion and social media have disrupted this. It's not, I think, so much Russian influence

1793
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:30,820
or something. It's everybody's influence. It's that a random person can come up with a conspiracy

1794
02:32:30,820 --> 02:32:37,940
theory and disrupt what people think. And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling or more

1795
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:44,340
attractive than the standardized public conspiracy theory that we give people as a default, then it

1796
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:48,900
might get more traction. You suddenly have the situation that a single individual somewhere

1797
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:55,780
on a farm in Texas has more listeners than CNN. Which particular farmer you're referring to in Texas?

1798
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:05,780
Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times. Okay. Right. It's an interesting situation because

1799
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:12,660
you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN if you don't go through a complicated gatekeeping process. And

1800
02:33:12,660 --> 02:33:18,500
suddenly you have random people without that gatekeeping process just optimizing for attention.

1801
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:24,340
Not necessarily with a lot of responsibility for the long-term effects of projecting these

1802
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:30,420
theories into the public. And now there is a push of making social media more like traditional media,

1803
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:35,380
which means that the opinion that is being projected in social media is more limited to

1804
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:41,540
an acceptable range with the goal of getting society into safe waters and increase the stability

1805
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:46,500
and cohesion of society again, which I think is a laudable goal. But of course, it also is an

1806
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:52,740
opportunity to seize the means of indoctrination. And the incentives that people are under when

1807
02:33:52,740 --> 02:34:01,300
they do this are in such a way that the AI ethics that we would need becomes very often something

1808
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:07,540
like AI politics, which is basically partisan and ideological. And this means that whatever one

1809
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:13,220
side says, another side is going to be disagreeing with. And the same way as when you turn masks or

1810
02:34:13,220 --> 02:34:18,740
the vaccine into a political issue, if you say that it is politically virtuous to get vaccinated,

1811
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:23,860
it will mean that the people that don't like you will not want to get vaccinated. And as soon as

1812
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:29,380
you have this partisan discourse, it's going to be very hard to make the right decisions because

1813
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:34,100
the incentives get to be the wrong ones. AI ethics needs to be super boring. It needs to be done by

1814
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:40,500
people who do statistics all the time and have extremely boring, long-winded discussions that

1815
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:44,580
most people cannot follow because they are too complicated, but that are dead serious.

1816
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:49,060
These people need to be able to be better at statistics than the leading machine learning

1817
02:34:49,060 --> 02:34:55,220
researchers. And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one where you don't have any barrier

1818
02:34:55,220 --> 02:35:00,500
to entry, right? Everybody who has a strong opinion and is able to signal that opinion in

1819
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:07,940
the right way can enter it. To me, that is a very frustrating thing because the field is so crucially

1820
02:35:07,940 --> 02:35:13,700
important to our future. It's so crucially important, but the only qualification currently

1821
02:35:13,700 --> 02:35:18,820
need is to be outraged by the injustice in the world. It's more complicated, right? Everybody

1822
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:24,340
seems to be outraged, but let's just say that the incentives are not always the right ones. So

1823
02:35:24,340 --> 02:35:30,660
basically, I suspect that a lot of people that enter this debate don't have a vision for what

1824
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:35,620
society should be looking like in a way that is nonviolent, that we preserve liberal democracy,

1825
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:41,940
where we make sure that we all get along and we are around in a few hundred years from now,

1826
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:46,180
preferably with the comfortable technological civilization around us.

1827
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:54,180
I generally have a very foggy view of that world, but I tend to try to follow,

1828
02:35:54,180 --> 02:35:59,780
and I think society should in some degree follow the gradient of love, increasing the amount of

1829
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:05,540
love in the world. And whenever I see different policies or algorithms or ideas that are not

1830
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:12,420
doing so, obviously, that's the ones that kind of resist. So the thing that terrifies me about this

1831
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:19,300
notion is I think that German fascism was driven by love. It was just a very selective love.

1832
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:22,820
It was a love that basically- Well, now you're just manipulating. I mean,

1833
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:32,660
I mean, you have to be very careful. You're talking to the wrong person in this way about love.

1834
02:36:32,660 --> 02:36:38,100
So let's talk about what love is. And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.

1835
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:44,020
It's the recognition of the sacred and the other. And this enables non-transactional interactions.

1836
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:54,500
But the size of the other that you include needs to be maximized. So it's basically

1837
02:36:57,060 --> 02:37:07,700
deep appreciation of the world around you, including the people that are very different

1838
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:12,820
than you, the people that disagree with you completely, including living creatures outside

1839
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:20,500
of just people, including ideas and appreciation of the full mess of it. And also it has to do with

1840
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:29,220
empathy, which is coupled with a lack of confidence, uncertainty of your own rightness.

1841
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:33,220
It's like a radical open-mindedness to the way forward.

1842
02:37:33,220 --> 02:37:38,660
I agree with every part of what you said. And now if you scale it up, what you recognize is that

1843
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:45,380
love is in some sense the service to a next level agency, to the highest level agency that you can

1844
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:52,340
recognize. It could be, for instance, life on earth or beyond that. You could say intelligent

1845
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:57,380
complexity in the universe that you try to maximize in a certain way. But when you think

1846
02:37:57,380 --> 02:38:03,060
it's true, it basically means a certain aesthetic. And there is not one possible aesthetic. There are

1847
02:38:03,060 --> 02:38:07,540
many possible aesthetics. And once you project an aesthetic into the future,

1848
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:12,900
you can see that there are some which defect from it, which are in conflict with it,

1849
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:18,420
that are corrupt, that are evil. You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil

1850
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:24,100
because the aesthetic of the world that he wanted is in conflict with the aesthetic of the world that

1851
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:32,100
you and me have in mind. And so the thing that he destroyed, we want to keep them in the world.

1852
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:40,180
There's kind of ways to deal. I mean, Hitler is an easier case, but perhaps he wasn't so easy

1853
02:38:40,180 --> 02:38:43,860
in the 30s to understand who is Hitler and who is not.

1854
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:49,540
No, it was no consensus that the aesthetics that he had in mind were unacceptable.

1855
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:59,860
Yeah. I mean, it's difficult. Love is complicated because you can't just be so open-minded that

1856
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:10,340
you let evil walk into the door, but you can't be so self-assured that you can always identify evil

1857
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:16,260
perfectly because that's what leads to Nazi Germany. Having a certainty of what is and

1858
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:25,540
wasn't evil, like always drawing lines of good versus evil. There has to be a dance between

1859
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:37,540
hard stances extending up against what is wrong, and at the same time, empathy and open-mindedness

1860
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:42,980
of towards not knowing what is right and wrong, and a dance between those.

1861
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:47,140
I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies that there is nobody who captures

1862
02:39:47,140 --> 02:39:53,860
my spirituality as well as he does. It's very interesting and suspicious. There is something

1863
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:59,780
going on in his movies that is very interesting. For instance, Mononoka is discussing not only

1864
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:07,060
an answer to Disney's simplistic notion of Mowgli, the jungle boy who was raised by wolves,

1865
02:40:07,060 --> 02:40:14,820
and as soon as he sees people realizes that he's one of them. The way in which the moral life

1866
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:19,940
and nature is simplified and romanticized and turned into kitsch is disgusting in the Disney

1867
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:25,460
movie. He answers to this. You see, he's replaced by Mononoka, this wolf girl who was raised by

1868
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:31,380
wolves and was fierce and dangerous and who cannot be socialized because she cannot be tamed,

1869
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:35,460
cannot be part of human society. You see, human society, it's something that is very,

1870
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:41,220
very complicated. You see people extracting resources and destroying nature, but the purpose

1871
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:48,100
is not to be evil, but to be able to have a life that is free from, for instance, oppression and

1872
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:56,020
violence and to curb death and disease. You basically see this conflict which cannot be

1873
02:40:56,020 --> 02:41:01,300
resolved in a certain way. You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden and it loses

1874
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:06,020
most of what it actually is and humans no longer submitting to life and death and nature.

1875
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:12,100
To these questions, there is no easy answer. It just turns it into something that is being observed

1876
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:17,940
as a journey that happens and that happens with a certain degree of inevitability. The nice thing

1877
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:22,500
about all his movies is there's a certain main character and it's the same in all movies.

1878
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:30,660
It's this little girl that is basically Heidi and I suspect that happened because when he did

1879
02:41:32,020 --> 02:41:36,500
field work for working on the Heidi movies back then, the Heidi animations,

1880
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:42,580
before he did his own movies, he traveled to Switzerland and southeastern Europe and

1881
02:41:42,580 --> 02:41:47,380
the Adriatic and so on and got an idea about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life

1882
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:54,260
that informed his future thinking. Heidi has a very interesting relationship to herself and to

1883
02:41:54,260 --> 02:41:59,860
the world. There is nothing that she takes for herself. She is in a way fearless because she is

1884
02:41:59,860 --> 02:42:06,100
committed to a service to a greater whole. Basically, she is completely committed to serving God.

1885
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:10,820
It is not an institutionalized God. It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church or

1886
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:16,020
something like this, but in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment of the spirit of European

1887
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:21,380
Protestantism. It's this idea of a being that is completely perfect and pure,

1888
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:29,620
and it's not a feminist vision because she is not a girl boss or something like this.

1889
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:36,500
She is the justification for the men in the audience to protect her, to build the civilization

1890
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:42,740
around her that makes her possible. She is not just the sacrifice of Jesus who is innocent and

1891
02:42:42,740 --> 02:42:47,620
therefore nailed to the cross. She is not being sacrificed. She is being protected

1892
02:42:47,620 --> 02:42:51,860
by everybody around her who recognizes that she is sacred, and there are enough around her

1893
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:57,300
to see that. This is a very interesting perspective. There is a certain notion of

1894
02:42:57,300 --> 02:43:02,180
innocence, and this notion of innocence is not universal. It's not in all cultures.

1895
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:08,100
Hitler wasn't innocent. His idea of Germany was not that there is an innocence that is being

1896
02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:13,140
protected. There was a predator that was going to triumph, and it's also something that is not at

1897
02:43:13,140 --> 02:43:16,900
the core of every religion. There are many religions which don't care about innocence.

1898
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:25,620
They might care about increasing the status of something, and that's a very interesting notion

1899
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:31,060
that is quite unique, and I'm not claiming it's the optimal one. It's just a particular kind of

1900
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:37,060
aesthetic, which I think makes Miyazaki into the most relevant Protestant philosopher today.

1901
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:42,980
And you're saying in terms of all the ways that a society can operate,

1902
02:43:42,980 --> 02:43:48,500
perhaps the preservation of innocence might be one of the best.

1903
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:57,060
No, it's just my aesthetic. It's a particular way in which I feel that I relate to the world that

1904
02:43:57,060 --> 02:44:02,740
is natural to my own civilization, and maybe it's not an accident that I have cultural roots in

1905
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:09,700
Europe in a particular world. So maybe it's a natural convergence point, and it's not something

1906
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:16,980
that you will find in all other times in history. So I'd like to ask you about Solzhenitsyn and our

1907
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:24,420
individual role as ants in this very large society. So he says that some version of the line between

1908
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:28,980
good and evil runs through the heart of every man. Do you think all of us are capable of good and

1909
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:39,140
evil? What's our role in this play, in this game we're all playing? Is all of us capable to play

1910
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:48,180
any role? Is there an ultimate responsibility to, you mentioned maintaining innocence or whatever

1911
02:44:48,180 --> 02:44:54,180
the highest ideal for a society you want, are all of us capable of living up to that? And that's our

1912
02:44:54,180 --> 02:45:00,660
responsibility, or is there significant limitations to what we're able to do in terms of good and evil?

1913
02:45:03,460 --> 02:45:09,540
So there is a certain way, if you are not parable, if you are committed to some kind of

1914
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:14,980
civilizational agency, a next level agent that you are serving, some kind of transcendent principle,

1915
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:20,500
in the eyes of that transcendental principle, you are able to discern good from evil. Otherwise,

1916
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:25,460
you cannot. Otherwise, you have just individual aesthetics. The cat that is torturing a mouse is

1917
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:32,100
not evil because the cat does not envision or not part of the world, of the cat is envisioning a

1918
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:37,380
world where there is no violence and nobody is suffering. If you have an aesthetic where you

1919
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:43,700
want to protect innocence, then torturing somebody needlessly is evil, but only then.

1920
02:45:44,660 --> 02:45:51,940
No, but I guess the question is within your sense of what is good and evil,

1921
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:58,340
it seems like we're still able to commit evil.

1922
02:45:59,220 --> 02:46:04,020
Yes. So basically, if you are committing to this next level agent, you are not necessarily

1923
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:09,220
are this next level agent. You are part of it. You have a relationship to it like the cell does

1924
02:46:09,220 --> 02:46:14,740
to its organism, its hyperorganism. It only exists to the degree that it's being implemented

1925
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:21,620
by you and others. That means that you're not completely fully serving it. You have freedom

1926
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:25,780
in what you decide, whether you are acting on your impulses and local incentives, on your

1927
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:31,220
feral impulses, so to speak, or whether you're committing to it. What you perceive then is a

1928
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:37,780
tension between what you would be doing with respect to the thing that you recognize as the

1929
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:42,980
sacred, if you do, and what you're actually doing. This is the line between good and evil,

1930
02:46:43,780 --> 02:46:48,820
where you see, oh, I'm here acting on my local incentives or impulses, and here I'm acting on

1931
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:53,460
what I consider to be sacred, and there's a tension between those. This is the line between

1932
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:58,740
good and evil that might run through your heart. If you don't have that, if you don't have this

1933
02:46:58,740 --> 02:47:03,140
relationship to a transcendental agent, you could call this relationship to the next level agent

1934
02:47:03,140 --> 02:47:08,180
soul. It's not a thing. It's not an immortal thing that is intrinsically valuable. It's a

1935
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:12,740
certain kind of relationship that you project to understand what's happening. Somebody is serving

1936
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:17,460
this transcendental sacredness or they're not. If you don't have a soul, you cannot be evil.

1937
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:24,900
You're just a complex natural phenomenon. If you look at life starting today or starting

1938
02:47:24,900 --> 02:47:31,860
tomorrow, when we leave here today, there's a bunch of trajectories that you can take through life.

1939
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:42,020
Maybe countless. Do you think some of these trajectories in your own conception of yourself,

1940
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:50,660
some of those trajectories are the ideal life? A life that if you were to be the hero of your life

1941
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:55,940
story, you would want to be. Look, is there some Josh Abak that you're striving to be?

1942
02:47:56,740 --> 02:48:00,580
This is the question I ask myself as an individual trying to make

1943
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:06,260
a better world in the best way that I could conceive of. What is my responsibility there?

1944
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:14,740
How much am I responsible for the failure to do so? Because I'm lazy and incompetent

1945
02:48:14,740 --> 02:48:19,780
too often in my own perception. In my own worldview, I'm not very important.

1946
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:28,020
I don't have place for me as a hero in my own world. I'm trying to do the best that I can,

1947
02:48:28,020 --> 02:48:36,900
which is often not very good. It's not important for me to have status or to be seen in a particular

1948
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:41,780
way. It's helpful if others can see me or a few people can see me that can be my friends.

1949
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:47,540
No, sorry. I want to clarify that here I didn't mean status or perception or

1950
02:48:50,420 --> 02:48:55,060
some kind of marketing thing, but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind.

1951
02:48:56,020 --> 02:49:01,860
Is there the kind of man you want to be and would consider it a failure if you don't become that?

1952
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:07,940
That's what I meant by hero. Yeah, not really. I don't perceive myself as having such an identity.

1953
02:49:10,580 --> 02:49:20,420
And it's also sometimes frustrating, but it's basically a lack of having this notion of

1954
02:49:20,660 --> 02:49:22,500
father that I need to be emulating.

1955
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:31,860
It's interesting. I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river. I worry that...

1956
02:49:33,940 --> 02:49:35,460
Sometimes it's more like being the river.

1957
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:48,500
I'm just a fat frog sitting on a leaf on a dirty muddy lake.

1958
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:57,940
Waiting for a princess to kiss me or the other way. I forgot which way it goes.

1959
02:49:57,940 --> 02:50:04,020
Somebody kisses somebody. Can I ask you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malice is, but

1960
02:50:05,780 --> 02:50:12,340
in terms of constructing systems of incentives, it's interesting to ask. I don't think I've talked

1961
02:50:12,340 --> 02:50:20,340
to you about this before. Malice espouses anarchism. So he sees all government as fundamentally

1962
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:25,300
getting in the way or even being destructive to

1963
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:34,100
collaborations between human beings thriving. What do you think? What's the role of government

1964
02:50:34,100 --> 02:50:44,340
in a society that thrives? Is anarchism at all compelling to you as a system? Not just

1965
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:49,460
small government, but no government at all. Yeah, I don't see how this would work.

1966
02:50:51,860 --> 02:50:57,220
The government is an agent that imposes an offset on your reward function on your payout

1967
02:50:57,220 --> 02:51:01,460
metrics. So your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.

1968
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:09,780
The argument there is that you can have collectives like governing organizations,

1969
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:15,700
but not government. Where you're born on a particular set of land and therefore you must

1970
02:51:15,700 --> 02:51:26,100
follow this rule or else you're forced by what they call violence because there's an implied

1971
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:35,380
violence here. The key aspect of government is it protects you from the rest of the world

1972
02:51:35,380 --> 02:51:43,700
with an army and with police. It has a monopoly on violence. It's the only one that's able to do

1973
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:48,900
violence. There are many forms of government. Not all governments do that, but we find that

1974
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:56,980
in successful countries, the government has a monopoly on violence. That means that you

1975
02:51:56,980 --> 02:52:00,820
cannot get ahead by starting your own army because the government will come down on you

1976
02:52:00,820 --> 02:52:05,380
and destroy you if you try to do that. In countries where you can build your own army

1977
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:10,660
and get away with it, some people will do it. These countries is what we call failed countries

1978
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:18,260
in a way. If you don't want to have violence, the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions of

1979
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:23,700
people because some people will use strategies if they get ahead with them that feel a particular

1980
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:30,260
kind of ecological niche. You need to destroy that ecological niche. If an effective government

1981
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:36,260
has a monopoly on violence, it can create a world where nobody is able to use violence and get ahead.

1982
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:42,180
You want to use that monopoly on violence not to exert violence, but to make violence impossible,

1983
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:47,460
to raise the cost of violence so people need to get ahead with nonviolent means.

1984
02:52:48,340 --> 02:52:54,260
The idea is that you might be able to achieve that in an anarchist state with companies,

1985
02:52:54,260 --> 02:53:01,700
so with the forces of capitalism, is create security companies where the one that's most

1986
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:07,300
ethically sound rises to the top. Basically, it would be a much better representative of the people

1987
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:15,300
because there is less stickiness to the big military force sticking around,

1988
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:22,100
even though it's long, overlived, outlived. You have groups of militants that are hopefully

1989
02:53:22,100 --> 02:53:26,660
efficiently organized because otherwise they're going to lose against the other groups of militants

1990
02:53:26,660 --> 02:53:32,740
and they are coordinating themselves with the rest of society until they are having a monopoly

1991
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:37,860
on violence. How is that different from a government? It's basically converging to the

1992
02:53:37,860 --> 02:53:44,100
same thing. I was trying to argue with Malice. I feel like it always converges towards government

1993
02:53:44,100 --> 02:53:50,260
at scale, but I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives that are ... You basically

1994
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:57,540
never let anything scale too big. One of the problems with governments is it gets too big

1995
02:53:57,540 --> 02:54:03,380
in terms of the size of the group over which it has control.

1996
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:12,660
My sense is that would happen anyway. A successful company like Amazon or Facebook,

1997
02:54:13,380 --> 02:54:19,620
it starts forming a monopoly over entire populations, not over just the hundreds of

1998
02:54:19,620 --> 02:54:27,140
millions but billions of people. I don't know, but there is something about the abuses of power,

1999
02:54:27,140 --> 02:54:33,780
the government can have when it has a monopoly on violence. That's a tension there.

2000
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:40,180
The question is, how can you set the incentives for government correctly? This mostly applies

2001
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:44,980
at the highest levels of government. Because we haven't found a way to set them correctly,

2002
02:54:44,980 --> 02:54:50,260
we made the highest levels of government relatively weak. This is, I think, part of the

2003
02:54:50,260 --> 02:54:55,700
reason why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic response. China didn't have that much

2004
02:54:55,700 --> 02:55:02,020
difficulty. There is, of course, a much higher risk of the abuse of power that exists in China

2005
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:08,100
because the power is largely unchecked. That's basically what happens in the next generation,

2006
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:12,500
for instance. Imagine that we would agree that the current government of China is largely correct

2007
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:18,660
and benevolent, and maybe we don't agree on this. But if we did, how can we make sure that this

2008
02:55:18,660 --> 02:55:24,740
stays like this? If you don't have checks and balances and division of power, it's hard to

2009
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:29,460
achieve. You don't have a solution for that problem. But the abolishment of government

2010
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:34,820
basically would remove the control structure. From a cybernetic perspective, there is an optimal

2011
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:41,140
point in the system that the regulation should be happening, that you can measure the current

2012
02:55:41,140 --> 02:55:46,180
incentives and the regulator would be properly incentivized to make the right decisions and

2013
02:55:46,180 --> 02:55:50,660
change the payout metrics of everything below it in such a way that the local prisoners' dilemmas

2014
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:56,020
get resolved. You cannot resolve the prisoner's dilemma without some kind of eternal control

2015
02:55:57,060 --> 02:56:05,140
that emulates an infinite game in a way. There's a sense in which it seems like the

2016
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:11,300
reason the parts of government that don't work well currently is because there's not good

2017
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:19,300
mechanisms through which to interact, for the citizenry to interact with government.

2018
02:56:21,380 --> 02:56:26,900
It hasn't caught up in terms of technology. I think once you integrate some of the digital

2019
02:56:26,900 --> 02:56:33,220
revolution of being able to have a lot of access to data, be able to vote on different ideas

2020
02:56:33,220 --> 02:56:39,140
at a local level, at all levels, at the optimal level, like you're saying, that can resolve the

2021
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:47,380
prisoner dilemmas and to integrate AI to help you automate things that don't require the human

2022
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:54,740
ingenuity, I feel like that's where government could operate that well and can also break apart

2023
02:56:54,740 --> 02:57:01,700
the inefficient bureaucracies if needed. There'll be a strong incentive to be efficient and

2024
02:57:01,700 --> 02:57:07,700
successful. Throughout human history, we see an evolutionary competition of modes of government

2025
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:12,820
and of individual governments is in these modes. Every nation state in some sense is some kind of

2026
02:57:12,820 --> 02:57:18,260
organism that has found different solutions for the problem of government. You could look

2027
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:23,460
at all these different models and the different scales at which it exists as empirical attempts

2028
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:31,300
to validate the idea of how to build a better government. I suspect that the idea of anarchism

2029
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:38,020
similar to the idea of communism is the result of being disenchanted with the ugliness of the

2030
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:44,660
real existing solutions and the attempt to get to an utopia. And I suspect that communism

2031
02:57:44,660 --> 02:57:49,060
originally was not a utopia. I think that in the same way as original Christianity,

2032
02:57:49,620 --> 02:57:55,940
it had a particular kind of vision. And this vision is a society, a mode of organization

2033
02:57:55,940 --> 02:58:04,340
within that society in which humans can coexist at scale without coercion, the same way as we do in

2034
02:58:04,340 --> 02:58:10,980
a healthy family. In a good family, you don't terrorize each other into compliance, but you

2035
02:58:10,980 --> 02:58:15,940
understand what everybody needs and what everybody is able to contribute and what the intended future

2036
02:58:15,940 --> 02:58:21,220
of the whole thing is. And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way and informs

2037
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:25,700
each other about how to do this. And all the interactions that happen are instrumental to

2038
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:31,300
making that happen. Could this happen at scale? And I think this is the idea of communism.

2039
02:58:31,300 --> 02:58:36,900
Communism is opposed to the idea that we need economic terror or other forms of terror to make

2040
02:58:36,900 --> 02:58:41,780
that happen. But in practice, what happened is that the proto-communist countries, the real

2041
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:48,100
existing socialism replaced a part of the economic terror with moral terror. So we were told to do

2042
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:52,740
the right thing for moral reasons. And of course, it didn't really work and the economy eventually

2043
02:58:52,740 --> 02:58:58,500
collapsed. And the moral terror had actual real cost. People were in prison because they were

2044
02:58:58,580 --> 02:59:07,140
morally non-compliant. The other thing is that the idea of communism became a utopia. So it

2045
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:12,740
basically was projected into the afterlife. We were told in my childhood that communism was

2046
02:59:12,740 --> 02:59:17,540
a hypothetical society to which we were in a permanent revolution that justified everything

2047
02:59:17,540 --> 02:59:22,500
that was presently wrong with society morally. But it was something that our grandchildren

2048
02:59:22,500 --> 02:59:27,460
probably would not ever see because it was too ideal and too far in the future to make it happen

2049
02:59:27,460 --> 02:59:32,500
right now. And people were just not there yet morally. And the same thing happened with

2050
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:37,460
Christianity. This notion of heaven was mythologized and projected into an afterlife.

2051
02:59:37,460 --> 02:59:42,260
And I think this was just the idea of God's kingdom, of this world in which we instantiate

2052
02:59:42,260 --> 02:59:47,220
the next level transcendental agent in the perfect form. So everything goes smoothly and without

2053
02:59:47,220 --> 02:59:52,820
violence and without conflict and without this human messiness on this economic messiness and

2054
02:59:52,820 --> 02:59:58,180
the terror and coercion that existed in the present societies. And the idea of whether

2055
02:59:58,180 --> 03:00:04,660
humans can exist at scale in a harmonious way and non-coercively is untested. A lot of people

2056
03:00:04,660 --> 03:00:09,860
tested it, but didn't get it to work so far. And the utopia is a world in where you get all

2057
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:15,860
the good things without any of the bad things. And you are, I think, very susceptible to believe in

2058
03:00:15,860 --> 03:00:20,660
utopias when you are very young and don't understand that everything has to happen in

2059
03:00:20,660 --> 03:00:25,060
causal patterns, that there is always feedback loops that ultimately are closed. There's nothing

2060
03:00:25,060 --> 03:00:30,260
that just happens because it's good or bad. Good or bad don't exist in isolation. They only exist

2061
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:40,980
with respect to larger systems. So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems? So like having a

2062
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:48,260
utopia that's out there beyond the horizon, is it because then... It's not only because it's

2063
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:56,020
impossible to achieve utopias, but it's because what certain humans, certain small number of humans

2064
03:00:56,020 --> 03:01:12,740
start to sort of greedily attain power and money and control and influence as they see the power

2065
03:01:12,820 --> 03:01:17,860
in using this idea of a utopia for propaganda. That's a bit like saying,

2066
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:22,740
why is my garden not perfect? It's because some evil weeds are overgrowing it and they always do.

2067
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:28,740
But this is not how it works. A good garden is a system that is in balance and requires minimal

2068
03:01:28,740 --> 03:01:36,420
interactions by the gardener. And so you need to create a system that is designed to self-stabilize.

2069
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:40,980
And the design of social systems requires not just the implementation of the desired functionality,

2070
03:01:40,980 --> 03:01:45,540
but the next level design, also in biological systems. You need to create a system that wants

2071
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:50,980
to converge to the intended function. And so instead of just creating an institution like

2072
03:01:50,980 --> 03:01:56,900
the FDA that is performing a particular kind of role in society, you need to make sure that the

2073
03:01:56,900 --> 03:02:01,620
FDA is actually driven by a system that wants to do this optimally, that is incentivized to do it

2074
03:02:01,620 --> 03:02:07,460
optimally, and then makes the performance that is actually enacted in every generation instrumental

2075
03:02:07,460 --> 03:02:12,260
to that thing, that actual goal. And that is much harder to design and to achieve.

2076
03:02:12,260 --> 03:02:18,340
So you have to design a system where... Listen, communism also was, quote unquote, incentivized

2077
03:02:19,060 --> 03:02:27,940
to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia. It wasn't working given human nature.

2078
03:02:27,940 --> 03:02:30,100
The incentives were not correct given human nature.

2079
03:02:30,100 --> 03:02:35,380
So how do you incentivize people when they are getting coal off the ground to work as hard as

2080
03:02:35,380 --> 03:02:41,700
possible? Because it's a terrible job and it's very bad for your health. And how do you do this?

2081
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:47,940
And you can give them prices and metals and status to some degree. There's only so much status to

2082
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:54,500
give for that. And most people will not fall for this. Or you can pay them. And you probably have

2083
03:02:54,500 --> 03:03:00,500
to pay them in an asymmetric way, because if you pay everybody the same and you nationalize the coal

2084
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:03,860
mines, eventually people will figure out that they can game the system.

2085
03:03:04,100 --> 03:03:11,300
Yes. So you're describing capitalism. Capitalism is the present solution to the system. And

2086
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:16,500
what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct in saying that capitalism is prone to

2087
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:22,900
crisis. That capitalism is a system that in its dynamics is not convergent, but divergent.

2088
03:03:22,900 --> 03:03:30,500
It's not a stable system. And that eventually it produces an enormous potential for productivity,

2089
03:03:31,060 --> 03:03:36,100
but it also is systematically misallocating resources. So a lot of people cannot participate

2090
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:41,620
in the production and consumption anymore. And this is what we observe. We observe that

2091
03:03:41,620 --> 03:03:47,620
the middle class in the US is tiny. A lot of people think that they're middle class,

2092
03:03:47,620 --> 03:03:50,420
but if you are still flying economy, you're not middle class.

2093
03:03:50,900 --> 03:03:55,220
Every class is a magnitude smaller than the previous class.

2094
03:03:55,220 --> 03:03:56,020
That's the Twitter quote.

2095
03:04:02,020 --> 03:04:07,380
The thing about classes is really like airline classes. There is the no-play class. A lot of

2096
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:12,180
people are economy class, business class, and very few are first class, and some are budget.

2097
03:04:12,180 --> 03:04:19,540
I mean, I understand. I think there is, yeah, maybe some people, probably I would push back

2098
03:04:20,260 --> 03:04:23,540
against that definition of the middle class. It does feel like the middle class is pretty large,

2099
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:28,980
but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth. There's a big wealth gap.

2100
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:34,660
In terms of the productivity that our society could have, there is no reason for anybody to

2101
03:04:34,660 --> 03:04:39,140
fly economy. We would be able to let everybody travel in style.

2102
03:04:40,180 --> 03:04:45,700
But also some people like to be frugal even when they're billionaires. So let's take that into

2103
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:51,060
account. I mean, you probably don't need to be a traveling lavish, but you also don't need to

2104
03:04:51,060 --> 03:04:56,260
be tortured, right? There is a difference between frugal and subjecting yourself to torture.

2105
03:04:56,260 --> 03:05:01,060
Listen, I love economy. I don't understand why you're comparing a flying economy to torture.

2106
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:08,100
Although the flight here, there's two crying babies next to me. But that has nothing to do

2107
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:11,460
with economy. It has to do with crying babies. They're very cute, though.

2108
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:16,340
I have two kids, and sometimes I have to go back to visit the grandparents.

2109
03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:24,820
Back means going from the West Coast to Germany, and it's a long flight.

2110
03:05:24,820 --> 03:05:30,580
Is it true that when you're a father, you grow immune to the crying and all that kind of stuff?

2111
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:37,380
Because me just not having kids, other people's kids can be quite annoying when they're crying

2112
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:41,700
and screaming and all that kind of stuff. When you have children and you're wired up

2113
03:05:41,700 --> 03:05:45,780
in the default natural way, you're lucky in this regard, you fall in love with them.

2114
03:05:46,500 --> 03:05:52,020
And this falling in love with them means that you basically start to see the world through their

2115
03:05:52,020 --> 03:05:59,060
eyes and you understand that in a given situation, they cannot do anything but expressing despair.

2116
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:05,300
And so it becomes more differentiated. I noticed that, for instance, my son is typically acting on

2117
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:12,660
a pure experience of what things are like right now, and he has to do this right now. And you

2118
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:19,060
have this small child when he was a baby and so on, where he was just immediately expressing

2119
03:06:19,060 --> 03:06:23,380
what he felt. And if you cannot regulate this from the outside, there's no point to be upset

2120
03:06:23,380 --> 03:06:28,580
about it. It's like dealing with weather or something like this. You all have to get through

2121
03:06:28,580 --> 03:06:34,980
it. And it's not easy for him either. But if you also have a daughter, maybe she is planning

2122
03:06:34,980 --> 03:06:41,220
for that. Maybe she understands that she's sitting in the car behind you and she's screaming at the

2123
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:45,220
top of her lungs and you're almost doing an accident and you really don't know what to do.

2124
03:06:45,860 --> 03:06:49,860
What should I have done to make you stop screaming? You could have given me candy.

2125
03:06:49,860 --> 03:06:56,580
I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion. I love it. Because you said

2126
03:06:57,620 --> 03:07:06,580
a fundamental aspect of that is love that makes it all worth it. What in this monkey riding an

2127
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:12,660
elephant in a dream world, what role does love play in the human condition?

2128
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:18,100
I think that love is the facilitator of non-transactual interaction.

2129
03:07:20,020 --> 03:07:25,620
And you are observing your own purposes. Some of these purposes go beyond your ego. They go

2130
03:07:25,620 --> 03:07:29,620
beyond the particular organism that you are and your local interests.

2131
03:07:29,620 --> 03:07:31,380
That's what you mean by non-transactional.

2132
03:07:31,380 --> 03:07:34,900
Yes. So basically when you are acting in a transactional way, it means that you are

2133
03:07:34,900 --> 03:07:39,540
respecting something in return for you from the one that you're interacting with.

2134
03:07:40,740 --> 03:07:44,660
You are interacting with a random stranger. You buy something from them on eBay. You expect a

2135
03:07:44,660 --> 03:07:49,140
fair value for the money that you send them and vice versa. Because you don't know that person.

2136
03:07:49,140 --> 03:07:53,220
You don't have any kind of relationship to them. But when you know this person a little bit better

2137
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:57,540
and you know the situation that they're in, you understand what they try to achieve in their life

2138
03:07:57,540 --> 03:08:03,460
and you approve because you realize that they're in some sense serving the same human sacredness

2139
03:08:03,460 --> 03:08:08,020
as you are. And they need to think that you have. Maybe you give it to them as a present.

2140
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:16,020
But the feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit, is a kind of transaction.

2141
03:08:16,820 --> 03:08:21,940
Yes, but the joy is not the point. The joy is the signal that you get. It's the reinforcement

2142
03:08:21,940 --> 03:08:27,060
signal that your brain sends to you because you are acting on the incentives of the agent that

2143
03:08:27,060 --> 03:08:32,180
you're part of. We are meant to be part of something larger. This is the way in which

2144
03:08:32,180 --> 03:08:37,940
we out-competed other hominids. Take that, Neanderthals.

2145
03:08:38,980 --> 03:08:45,620
Yeah. And also other humans. There was a population bottleneck for human society

2146
03:08:45,620 --> 03:08:52,420
that leads to an extreme lack of genetic diversity among humans. If you look at Bushmen

2147
03:08:52,420 --> 03:08:57,140
in the Kalahari, that basically tribes that are not that far distant to each other have more

2148
03:08:57,140 --> 03:09:03,460
genetic diversity than exists between Europeans and Chinese. And it's because basically the

2149
03:09:03,460 --> 03:09:09,300
out-of-Africa population at some point had a bottleneck of just a few thousand individuals.

2150
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:15,780
And what probably happened is not that at any time the number of people shrunk below a few

2151
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:20,900
hundred thousand. What probably happened is that there was a small group that had a decisive

2152
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:25,220
mutation that produced an advantage. And this group multiplied and killed everybody else.

2153
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:32,900
And we are descendants of that group. Yeah. I wonder what the peculiar characteristics

2154
03:09:32,900 --> 03:09:37,220
of that group. I mean, we can never know. And a lot of people do.

2155
03:09:38,180 --> 03:09:43,780
We can only just listen to the echoes in ours, like the ripples that are still within us.

2156
03:09:43,780 --> 03:09:48,740
So I suspect what eventually made a big difference was the ability to organize at scale,

2157
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:53,460
to program each other. With ideas.

2158
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:59,220
That we became programmable, that we are willing to work in lockstep, that we went above the tribal

2159
03:09:59,220 --> 03:10:04,180
level, that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals and acted on direct

2160
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:10,180
reputation systems transactionally, but that we basically evolved an adaptation to become state

2161
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:16,820
building. Yeah. To form collectives outside of

2162
03:10:16,820 --> 03:10:19,860
the direct collectives. Yes. And that basically a part of us

2163
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:24,020
became committed to serving something outside of what we know.

2164
03:10:24,020 --> 03:10:28,020
Yeah. Then that's kind of what love is. And it's terrifying because it meant that

2165
03:10:28,020 --> 03:10:34,900
we eradicated the others. It's a force. It's an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution,

2166
03:10:34,900 --> 03:10:37,300
which means we displace something else that doesn't have that.

2167
03:10:38,820 --> 03:10:41,700
Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people that weren't about love.

2168
03:10:42,420 --> 03:10:45,460
So love led to destruction. We didn't have the same strong love as we did.

2169
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:52,100
Right. That's why I mentioned this thing with fascism. When you see these speeches,

2170
03:10:52,660 --> 03:10:57,220
do you want total war? And everybody says, yes, right? This is this big,

2171
03:10:58,180 --> 03:11:01,700
oh my God, we are part of something that is more important than me, that gives meaning to my

2172
03:11:01,700 --> 03:11:05,620
existence. Fair enough.

2173
03:11:09,060 --> 03:11:16,260
Do you have advice for young people today in high school, in college, that are thinking about what

2174
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:22,420
to do with their career, with their life, so that at the end of the whole thing,

2175
03:11:22,420 --> 03:11:28,820
they can be proud of what they did? Don't cheat. Have integrity.

2176
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:30,500
A for integrity. Integrity.

2177
03:11:30,500 --> 03:11:35,300
So what does integrity look like when you're the river or the leaf or the fat frog in a lake?

2178
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:43,300
It basically means that you try to figure out what the thing is that is the most right.

2179
03:11:44,100 --> 03:11:48,500
And this doesn't mean that you have to look for what other people tell you what's right,

2180
03:11:49,220 --> 03:11:54,820
but you have to aim for more autonomy. So things need to be right independently of what other

2181
03:11:54,820 --> 03:12:03,140
people say. I always felt that when people told me to listen to what others say, like

2182
03:12:03,860 --> 03:12:09,060
read the room, build your ideas of what's true based on the high status people of your in-group,

2183
03:12:09,060 --> 03:12:15,060
that does not protect me from fascism. The only way to protect yourself from fascism is to decide

2184
03:12:15,060 --> 03:12:21,700
it's the world that is being built here, the world that I want to be in. And so in some sense,

2185
03:12:21,700 --> 03:12:26,820
try to make your behavior sustainable. Act in such a way that you would feel comfortable on

2186
03:12:26,820 --> 03:12:30,980
all sides of the transaction. Realize that everybody is you in a different timeline,

2187
03:12:30,980 --> 03:12:34,580
but is seeing things differently and has reasons to do so.

2188
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:42,900
Yeah, I've come to realize this recently. There is an inner voice that tells you what's right and

2189
03:12:43,460 --> 03:12:50,820
wrong. And speaking of reading the room, there's times what integrity looks like is there's times

2190
03:12:50,820 --> 03:12:56,660
when a lot of people are doing something wrong. And what integrity looks like is not going on

2191
03:12:56,660 --> 03:13:04,420
Twitter and tweeting about it, but not participating quietly, not doing. So it's not like signaling or

2192
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:11,140
all this kind of stuff, but actually living what you think is right, like living it.

2193
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:16,420
There's also sometimes this expectation that others are like us. So imagine the possibility

2194
03:13:16,420 --> 03:13:22,580
that some of the people around you are space aliens that only look human. So they don't have

2195
03:13:22,580 --> 03:13:27,540
the same prayers as you do. They don't have the same impulses of what's right and wrong. There's

2196
03:13:27,540 --> 03:13:33,860
a large diversity in these basic impulses that people can have in a given situation.

2197
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:38,980
And now realize that you are a space alien. You are not actually human. You think that you're

2198
03:13:38,980 --> 03:13:43,940
human, but you don't know what it means, what it's like to be human. You just make it up as

2199
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:49,780
you go along like everybody else. And you have to figure that out, what it means that you are

2200
03:13:50,420 --> 03:13:54,900
full human being, what it means to be human in the world and how to connect with others on that.

2201
03:13:55,620 --> 03:14:03,060
And there's also something, don't be afraid in the sense that if you do this, you're not good enough.

2202
03:14:03,060 --> 03:14:07,220
Because if you are acting on these incentives of integrity, you become trustworthy.

2203
03:14:07,220 --> 03:14:12,100
That's the way in which you can recognize each other. There is a particular place where you

2204
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:17,780
can meet and you can figure out what that place is, where you will give support to people because

2205
03:14:17,780 --> 03:14:23,220
you realize that they act with integrity and they will also do that. So in some sense,

2206
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:29,220
you are safe if you do that. You're not always protected. There are people which will abuse you

2207
03:14:29,220 --> 03:14:35,060
and that are bad actors in a way that it's hard to imagine before you meet them. But

2208
03:14:36,100 --> 03:14:39,060
there is also people which will try to protect you.

2209
03:14:39,060 --> 03:14:47,380
CB Yeah. Thank you for saying that. That's such a hopeful message that no matter what happens to

2210
03:14:47,460 --> 03:14:56,900
you, there'll be a place, there's people you'll meet that also have what you have

2211
03:14:57,780 --> 03:15:02,100
and you will find happiness there and safety there.

2212
03:15:02,100 --> 03:15:07,620
SRS Yeah. But it doesn't need to end well. It can also all go wrong. So there's no guarantees

2213
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:13,220
in this life. So you can do everything right and you still can fail and you can still

2214
03:15:13,220 --> 03:15:18,660
horrible things happen to you that traumatize you and mutilate you and you have to be grateful

2215
03:15:18,660 --> 03:15:24,980
if it doesn't happen. CB And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens

2216
03:15:24,980 --> 03:15:32,420
because even just being alive is pretty damn nice. SRS Yeah. Even that, you know. The gratefulness

2217
03:15:32,420 --> 03:15:39,860
in some sense is also just generated by your brain to keep you going. It's all the trick.

2218
03:15:40,820 --> 03:15:48,420
CB Speaking of which, Camus said, I see many people die because they judge that life is not

2219
03:15:48,420 --> 03:15:54,900
worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them

2220
03:15:54,900 --> 03:16:00,340
a reason for living. What is called the reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.

2221
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:08,580
I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions. So I have to ask

2222
03:16:08,580 --> 03:16:15,780
what, Jascha Bach, is the meaning of life? It is an urgent question according to Camus.

2223
03:16:15,780 --> 03:16:22,580
SRS I don't think that there's a single answer to this. Nothing makes sense unless the mind

2224
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:29,380
makes it so. So you basically have to project a purpose. And if you zoom out far enough,

2225
03:16:29,380 --> 03:16:33,220
there's the heat test of the universe and everything is meaningless. Everything is just

2226
03:16:33,220 --> 03:16:37,220
a blip in between. And the question is, do you find meaning in this blip in between?

2227
03:16:37,860 --> 03:16:44,340
Do you find meaning in observing squirrels? Do you find meaning in raising children and

2228
03:16:44,340 --> 03:16:49,860
projecting a multi-generational organism into the future? Do you find meaning in projecting an

2229
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:54,420
aesthetic of the world that you like into the future and trying to serve that aesthetic?

2230
03:16:54,420 --> 03:16:59,140
And if you do, then life has that meaning. And if you don't, then it doesn't.

2231
03:16:59,140 --> 03:17:04,420
SRS I kind of enjoy the idea that you just create the most

2232
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:12,260
vibrant, the most weird, the most unique kind of blip you can, given your environment,

2233
03:17:12,260 --> 03:17:23,140
given your set of skills, just be the most weird set of like local pocket of complexity you can be.

2234
03:17:23,780 --> 03:17:28,820
So that like when people study the universe, they'll pause and be like, uh, that's weird.

2235
03:17:30,260 --> 03:17:34,500
It looks like a useful strategy, but of course, it's still motivated reasoning.

2236
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:39,620
You're obviously acting on your incentives here.

2237
03:17:39,620 --> 03:17:45,540
SRS It's still a story we tell ourselves within a dream that's hardly in touch with the reality.

2238
03:17:45,540 --> 03:17:48,100
SRS It's definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.

2239
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:54,820
And a human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am.

2240
03:17:54,820 --> 03:17:56,900
SRS Yeah, there's a mutual relationship somehow.

2241
03:17:56,900 --> 03:18:01,940
SRS Somehow. Josh, you're one of the most incredible people I know.

2242
03:18:02,900 --> 03:18:08,100
I really love talking to you. I love talking to you again. And it's really an honor that you spend

2243
03:18:08,100 --> 03:18:14,420
your valuable time with me. I hope we get to talk many times throughout our short and meaningless

2244
03:18:14,420 --> 03:18:20,020
lives. Or meaningful. Or meaningful. Thank you, Alex. I enjoyed this conversation very much.
