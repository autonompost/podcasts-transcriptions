00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
The following is a conversation with Josje Bach, his third time on this podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,840
Josje is one of the most brilliant and fascinating minds in the world,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,520
exploring the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and computation.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,440
And he's one of my favorite humans to talk to about pretty much anything and everything.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,040
And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,120
It's the best way to support this podcast. We've got Numerai for the world's hardest

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,680
data science tournament, 8Sleep for naps, Masterclass for learning, and AG1 for health,

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680
choose wisely, my friends. Also, if you want to work with our amazing team,

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
we're always hiring, go to lexfreedman.com slash hiring.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,720
And now, onto the full ad reads. As always, no ads in the middle.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,360
I try to make this interesting, but if you must skip them,

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,800
please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will, too.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,760
This show is brought to you by Numerai, a hedge fund that uses AI and machine learning to make

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,000
investment decisions. It's basically a super difficult machine learning tournament that uses

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,120
real data and people's submitted models that try to predict the market. I love difficult

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,360
real world data sets. You may know that for a long time and still, I've been interested in

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,760
real world robotics. One of the largest scale deployment of real world robotics is autonomous

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,360
vehicles. Autonomous driving and semi-autonomous driving, the stakes are very high. The same is

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,720
true for financial markets. It's really interesting that Numerai presents to you

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,080
the real world data of financial markets and presents you an easy accessible mechanism by

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,280
which to test, deploy, and compete with others in this kind of data set. It's a really great

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,880
way, if you're interested in data science and machine learning, to learn, to compete,

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,840
to have fun, all that kind of stuff. Head over to numer.ai.lex to sign up for a tournament

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,480
and hone your machine learning skills. That's numer.ai.lex for a chance to play against me

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:11,440
and win a share of the tournament's prize pool. This episode is also brought to you by 8 Sleep

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,800
and its new Pi3 mattress. In the scorching Texas heat, the thing I go to escape, to escape nature

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,320
are the external harsh conditions of nature and going to the nature of my own mind.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,400
Wherever that weird and beautiful dream world is, the place that has no rules, no boundaries,

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,400
no limits, no physics, no constraints on what is possible and what is impossible.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,840
The dream world that we go to, what is that world? It's the same world as imagination.

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,880
It's such a fascinating world. The human mind, its capabilities are just so incredibly fascinating,

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,560
and one of the ways to explore that is to dream. But it's the return from the dream world that is

33
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,400
the most refreshing to me. That's why I love naps. It's a quick stroll through the dream world and

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,360
your back and taking on the challenges of the day in the here and now. Anyway, if you're into

35
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,800
naps as much as me, you should check out 8 Sleep and you'll get special savings when you go to

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,520
8sleep.com. This show is also brought to you by Masterclass. $10 a month gets you an all-access

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,480
pass to watch courses from the best people in the world in their respective disciplines.

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,640
The list of courses I've personally watched and enjoyed just lasts forever, but they have

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,640
everybody and anybody you ever want to listen to. I've listened to Martin Scorsese, Tony Hogg,

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,320
Jane Goodall, Neil Gaiman, Daniel Negron before I interviewed him, Garry Kasparov,

41
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,360
Carlos Santana, Will Wright, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Chris Hadfield. The list is incredible.

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm a huge believer that learning about a thing, at least part of learning about a thing,

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,120
should involve learning or listening to the best people in the world at that thing.

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,680
It's not only the advice they give, it's not only the analysis or the description

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:22,640
of how they approach the thing, but in the way they see life, in the way they carry themselves

46
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,480
physically and mentally. You get to watch Mastery and it's so beautiful that human beings are able

47
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,440
to reach the very top of excellence and sometimes break through the boundaries,

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
the limits of what was thought possible before, and it's just beautiful to watch those humans.

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,760
It's beautiful, it's inspiring, it's great to celebrate that, it's great to learn from that.

50
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400
Anyway, get unlimited access to every Masterclass and get 15% off

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,240
an annual membership at masterclass.com slash lex. That's masterclass.com slash lex.

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,920
This show is brought to you by AG1. Their all-in-one daily drink brings happiness to me,

53
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,160
and daily for me is twice daily. It brings happiness, health, and ensures that all the

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,920
crazy physical and mental stuff I do is built on a foundation of basic nutritional health.

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,880
It's the super multivitamin that I use. It also is one of the components of daily habits

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:32,240
that I have in my life, and so whenever I do this thing, I feel grounded. I feel happy. I feel like

57
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
I have my life together. So you could do that both at home and with the travel packs when you're

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,880
traveling. In fact, it's one of the things that makes me feel like I'm at home when I'm traveling.

59
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,640
I'll drink an AG1 and it'll feel good. It'll put a smile on my face. It's green, it tastes delicious,

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,280
it's green, it tastes delicious. What else do you want? They'll give you a one month supply

61
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,840
of fish oil when you sign up at drinkag1.com slash lex. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

63
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,760
here's Josje Bach.

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
You wrote a post about levels of lucidity.

65
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,120
As we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,480
accumulating ideas about itself, but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages.

67
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,680
There are seven of the stages. Stage one, reactive survival, infant. Stage two, personal self,

68
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,120
young child. Stage three, social self, adolescence, domesticated adult. Stage four is rational agency,

69
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,920
self-direction. Stage five is self-authoring. That's full adult. You've achieved wisdom,

70
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,920
but there's two more stages. Stage six is enlightenment. Stage seven is transcendence.

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,360
Can you explain each or the interesting parts of each of these stages? And what's your sense

72
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,040
why there are stages of this, of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short life?

73
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:32,160
This model is derived from a concept by the psychologist Robert Keegan. And he talks about

74
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,760
the development of the self as a process that happens in principle by some kind of

75
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,920
reverse engineering of a mind where you gradually become aware of yourself and thereby build

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,160
structure that allows you to interact deeper with the world and yourself. And I found myself using

77
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,880
this model not so much as a developmental model. I'm not even sure if it's a very good developmental

78
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,760
model because I saw my children not progressing exactly like that. And I also suspect that

79
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,000
you don't go through these stages necessarily in succession. And it's not that you work through

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,960
one stage and then you get into the next one. Sometimes you revisit them. Sometimes stuff is

81
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,160
happening in parallel. But it's, I think, a useful framework to look at what's present and the

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
structure of a person and how they interact with the world and how they relate to themselves.

83
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
So it's more like a philosophical framework that allows you to talk about how minds work.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
And at first, when we are born, we don't have a personal self yet, I think.

85
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,000
Instead, we have an attentional self. And this attentional self is initially in the infant task

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,800
is building a world model and also an initial model of the self. But mostly it's building a

87
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,320
game engine in the brain that is tracking sensory data and uses it to explain it. And in some sense,

88
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,640
you could compare it to a game engine like Minecraft or so. So colors and sounds,

89
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
people are all not physical objects. They are creation of our mind at a certain level of

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:04,960
core screening, models that are mathematical that use geometry and that use manipulation of

91
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,480
objects and so on to create scenes in which we can find ourselves and interact with them.

92
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
So Minecraft.

93
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,000
And this personal self is something that is more or less created after the world is finished,

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
after it's trained into the system, after it has been constructed. And this personal self is an

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,840
agent that interacts with the outside world. And the outside world is not the world of quantum

96
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,960
mechanics, not the physical universe, but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.

97
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,040
And this is us and we experience ourselves interacting with that outside world that is

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,760
created inside of our own mind. And outside of our self, there are feelings and they presented

99
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,640
our interface to this outside world. They pose problems to us. These feelings are basically

100
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,920
attitudes that our mind is computing that tell us what's needed in the world, the things that

101
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,160
we are drawn to, the things that we are afraid of. And we are tasked with solving this problem of

102
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,920
satisfying the needs, avoiding the aversions, following on our inner commitments and so on,

103
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,000
and also modeling ourselves and building the next stage. So after we have this personal self and

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,320
stage two online, many people form a social self. And this social self allows the individual to

105
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,240
experience themselves as part of a group. It's basically this thing that when you are playing

106
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,360
in a team, for instance, you don't notice yourself just as a single node that is reaching out into

107
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,840
the world, but you're also looking down. You're looking down from this entire group and you see

108
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,320
how this group is looking at this individual. And everybody in the group is in some sense,

109
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,000
emulating this group spirit to some degree. And in this state, people are forming their opinions

110
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,880
by assimilating them from this group mind. They basically gain the ability to act a little bit

111
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,960
like a hive mind. But are you also modeling the interaction of how opinions shapes and forms

112
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,280
through the interaction of the individual nodes within the group? Yeah, the way in which people

113
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,040
do it in this stage is that they experience what are the opinions of my environment. They

114
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,320
experience the relationship that I have to their environment and they resonate with people around

115
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,760
them and get more opinions through this interaction, the way in which they relate to others.

116
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,760
And at stage four, you basically understand that stuff is true and false independently,

117
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,160
what other people believe. And you have agency over your own beliefs in that stage. You basically

118
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,720
discover epistemology, the rules about determining what's true and false. So you start to learn how

119
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,800
to think. Yes. I mean, at some level, you're always thinking, you are constructing things.

120
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,280
And I believe that this ability to reason about your mental representation is what we mean by

121
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,800
thinking. It's an intrinsically reflexive process that requires consciousness. Without consciousness,

122
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,240
you cannot think. You can generate the content of feelings and so on outside of consciousness.

123
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,280
It's very hard to be conscious of how your feelings emerge, at least in the early stages

124
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,680
of development. But thoughts is something that you always control. And if you are a nerd like me,

125
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,600
you often have to skip stage three because you lack the intuitive empathy with others.

126
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Because in order to resonate with a group, you need to have a quite similar architecture.

127
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,240
And if people are via differently, then it's hard for them to resonate with other people and

128
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,720
basically have empathy, which is not the same as compassion, but it is a shared perceptual mental

129
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
state. Empathy happens not just via inference about the mental states of others, but it's

130
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,440
a perception of what other people feel and where they're at. Can't you not have empathy

131
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,080
while also not having a similar architecture, cognitive architecture, as the others in the group?

132
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,640
I think, yes. But you often, well, I experienced that too. But you need to build something that

133
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,440
is like a meta architecture. You need to be able to embrace the architecture of the other to some

134
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,160
degree or find some shared common ground. And it's also this issue that if you are a nerd,

135
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,560
normies often, basically neurotypical people, have difficulty to resonate with you.

136
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,280
And as a result, they have difficulty understanding you unless they have enough

137
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,000
wisdom to feel what's going on there. Well, isn't the whole process of the stage

138
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,040
three to figure out the API to the other humans that have different architecture and

139
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,400
you yourself publish public documentation for the API that people can interact with for you?

140
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Isn't this the whole process of socializing? My experience as a child growing up was that

141
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,080
I did not find any way to interface with the stage three people. And they didn't do that with me.

142
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,920
Did you try?

143
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah, of course, I tried it very hard. But it was only when I entered a mathematics school

144
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,200
at ninth grade, lots of other nerds were present, that I found people that I could

145
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,200
deeply resonate with and had the impression that, yes, I have friends now. I found my own people.

146
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,360
And before that, I felt extremely lonely in the world. There was basically nobody I could connect

147
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:18,880
to. And I remember there was one moment in all these years where there was a school exchange

148
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,640
and it was a Russian boy, a kid from the Russian garrison stationed in eastern Germany who visited

149
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,840
our school. And we played a game of chess against each other. And we looked into each other's eyes

150
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,080
and we sat there for two hours playing this game of chess. And I had the impression this is a human

151
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,440
being. He understands what I understand. We didn't even speak the same language.

152
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,960
I wonder if your life could have been different if you knew that it's okay to be different,

153
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,440
to have a different architecture, whether accepting that the interface is hard to figure out,

154
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,360
takes a long time to figure out, and it's okay to be different. In fact, it's beautiful to be different.

155
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,760
It was not my main concern. My main concern was mostly that I was alone. It was not so much the

156
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,920
question, is it okay to be the way I am? I couldn't do much about it, so I had to deal with it.

157
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,080
But my main issue was that I was not sure if I would ever meet anybody growing up

158
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,800
that I would connect to at such a deep level that I would feel that I could belong.

159
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,320
So there's a visceral undeniable feeling of being alone.

160
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Yes. And I noticed the same thing when I came into the math school that

161
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,920
I think at least half, probably two thirds of these kids were severely traumatized as

162
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
children growing up and in large part due to being alone

163
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,720
because they couldn't find anybody to relate to.

164
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,280
Don't you think everybody's alone, deep down?

165
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,520
No.

166
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,440
All right.

167
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,080
I'm not alone anymore. It took me some time to update and to get over the trauma and so on,

168
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,760
but I felt that in my 20s, I had lots of friends and I had my place in the world.

169
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,640
And I had no longer doubts that I would never be alone again.

170
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,840
Is there some aspect to which we're alone together? You don't see a deep loneliness

171
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
inside yourself still?

172
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
No. Sorry.

173
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,600
Okay. So that's the nonlinear progression through the stages, I suppose. You caught

174
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,640
up on stage three at some point?

175
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,080
Yes. We're at stage four. And so basically I find that many nerds

176
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,440
jump straight into stage four by passing stage three.

177
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,200
Do they return to it then later?

178
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,320
Yeah, of course. Sometimes they do, not always. The question is basically, do you stay a little

179
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,920
bit autistic or do you catch up? And I believe you can catch up. You can build this missing

180
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,400
structure and basically experience yourself as part of a group, learn intuitive empathy,

181
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,720
and develop this perceptual sense of feeling what other people feel.

182
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,520
And before that, I could only basically feel this when I was deeply in love with somebody

183
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,160
and we synced.

184
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,880
So there's a lot of friction to feeling that way. It only with certain people as opposed

185
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,960
to it comes naturally. It's frictionless.

186
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,160
But this is something that basically later I felt started to resolve itself for me,

187
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,600
to a large degree.

188
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,240
What was the trick?

189
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,560
In many ways, growing up and paying attention. Meditation did help. I had some very crucial

190
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:38,400
experiences in getting close to people, building connections, cuddling a lot in my student years.

191
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,040
So really paying attention to the feeling of another human being fully.

192
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,920
Loving other people and being loved by other people and building a space in which you can be

193
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,480
safe and can experiment and touch a lot and be close to somebody a lot.

194
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,600
And over time, basically, at some point you realize, oh, it's no longer that I feel locked

195
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,160
out, but I feel connected and I experience where somebody else is at.

196
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,200
And normally my mind is racing very fast at a high frequency. So it's not always working

197
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,560
like this. Sometimes it works better. Sometimes it works less.

198
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,000
But I also don't see this as a pressure. It's more interesting to observe myself

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,400
which frequency I'm at and at which mode somebody else is at.

200
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,680
Yeah. Man, the mind is so beautiful in that way. Sometimes it comes so natural to me,

201
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,720
so easy to pay attention to the world fully, to other people fully.

202
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,880
And sometimes the stress over silly things is overwhelming.

203
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
It's so interesting that the mind is that roller coaster in that way.

204
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,760
At stage five, you discover how identity is constructed.

205
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
Self-offered. You realize that your

206
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,280
values are not terminal, but they are instrumental to achieving a world that you like and aesthetics

207
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,800
that you prefer. And the more you understand this, the more you get agency over how your

208
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,080
identity is constructed. And you realize that identity and interpersonal interaction is a

209
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,080
costume. And you should be able to have agency over that costume. It's useful to be a costume.

210
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,360
It tells something to others and allows to interface in roles. But being locked into this

211
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,080
is a big limitation. The word costume kind of implies

212
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,000
that it's fraudulent in some way. Is costume a good word for you?

213
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
No. To present ourselves to the world.

214
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,280
In some sense, I learned a lot about costumes at Burning Man. Before that,

215
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,960
I did not really appreciate costumes and saw them more as uniforms, like wearing a suit if you are

216
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,400
working in a bank or if you are trying to get startup funding from a VC in Switzerland.

217
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Then you dress up in a particular way. And this is mostly to show the other side that you are

218
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,240
willing to play by the rules and you understand what the rules are. But there is something deeper.

219
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,320
When you are at Burning Man, your costume becomes self-expression and there is no

220
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,640
boundary to the self-expression. You're basically free to wear what you want,

221
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,120
to express to other people what you feel like this day and what kind of interactions you want

222
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,200
to have. Is the costume a kind of projection

223
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,120
of who you are? That's very hard to say because the

224
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,240
costume also depends on what other people see in the costume. And this depends on the context that

225
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,120
the other people understand. So you have to create something, if you want to, that is legible

226
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,600
to the other side and that means something to yourself. Do we become prisoners of the costume?

227
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,320
Because everybody expects us to. Some people do. But I think that once you

228
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,800
realize that you wear a costume at Burning Man, a variety of costumes,

229
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,040
realize that you cannot not wear a costume. Basically everything that you wear and present

230
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:03,120
to others is something that is to some degree in addition to what you are deep inside.

231
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,480
So this stage, in parentheses, you put full adult, wisdom. Why is this full adult?

232
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,280
Why would you say this is full? And why is it wisdom?

233
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,120
It does allow you to understand why other people have different identities from yours.

234
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,400
And it allows you to understand that the difference between people who vote for different

235
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,560
parties and might have very different opinions and different value systems is often the accident of

236
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,600
where they are born and what happened after that to them and what traits they got before they were

237
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,080
born. And at some point you realize the perspective where you understand that everybody could be you

238
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,040
in a different timeline if you just flip those bits. How many costumes do you have?

239
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,240
I don't count. More than one? Yeah, of course.

240
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,880
How easy is to do costume changes throughout the day?

241
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,600
It's just a matter of energy and interest. When you are wearing your pajamas and you switch out

242
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,200
of your pajamas into say a work shirt and pants, you're making a costume change, right? And if you

243
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,040
are putting on a gown, you're making a costume change. And you could do the same with personality?

244
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,840
You could if that's what you're into. There are people which have multiple personalities for

245
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,640
interaction in multiple roles. If somebody works in a store and you put up a storekeeper personality

246
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,040
when you're presenting yourself at work, you develop a sub-personality for this.

247
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,600
And the social persona for many people is in some sense a puppet that they're playing like a marionette.

248
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,120
And if they play this all the time, they might forget that there is something

249
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,560
behind this. There's something what it feels like to be in your skin.

250
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,000
And I guess it's very helpful if you're able to get back into this. And for me, the other way around

251
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,120
is relatively hard. For me, it's pretty hard to learn how to play consistent social roles. For me,

252
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,520
it's much easier just to be real. Or not real, but to have one costume.

253
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,160
No, it's not quite the same. So basically when you are wearing a costume at Burning Man and say you

254
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,560
are an extraterrestrial prince. There's something where you are expressing in some sense something

255
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,640
that's closer to yourself than the way in which you hide yourself behind a standard closing when

256
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,400
you go out in the city in the default world. And so this costume that you're wearing at Burning Man

257
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:42,080
allows you to express more of yourself. And you have a shorter distance of advertising to people

258
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,480
what kind of person you are, what kind of interaction you would want to have with them.

259
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:55,280
And so you get much earlier into media stress. And I believe it's regrettable that we do not

260
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,960
use the opportunities that we have with custom-made clothing now to wear costumes that are much more

261
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,240
stylish, that are much more custom-made, that are not necessarily part of a fashion in which you

262
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,520
express which milieu you're part of and how up-to-date you are. But you also express

263
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,480
how you are as an individual and what you want to do today and how you feel today and

264
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,520
what you intend to do about it. Well, isn't it easier now in the digital world to

265
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,080
explore different costumes? I mean, that's the kind of idea with virtual reality. That's the

266
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,600
idea even with Twitter and two-dimensional screens. You can swap all costumes. You can

267
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,200
be as weird as you want. It's easier for Burning Man. You have to order things. You have to

268
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,440
make things. It's even better if you make them yourself.

269
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,720
Sure. But it's just easier to do digitally, right?

270
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,360
It's not about easy. It's about how to get it right. And for me, the first Burning Man

271
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,080
experience, I got adopted by a bunch of people in Boston who direct me to Burning Man. And

272
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,480
we spent a few weekends doing costumes together. And it was an important part of the experience

273
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,680
where the camp bonded, that people got to know each other. And we basically grew into the

274
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,920
experience that we would have later. So the extraterrestrial prince is based

275
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,040
on a true story. Yeah.

276
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,160
I can only imagine what that looks like, Josje. Stage six.

277
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,360
Stage six. At some point, you can collapse the division between a personal self and

278
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,360
world generator again. And a lot of people get there via meditation, or some of them get there

279
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,200
via psychedelics, some of them by accident. And you suddenly notice that you are not actually

280
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,720
a person, but you are a vessel that can create a person. And the person is still there. You

281
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,520
observe that personal self, but you observe the personal self from the outside. And you

282
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,560
notice it's a representation. And you might also notice that the world that is being created is a

283
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,040
representation. If not, then you might experience that I am the universe. I'm the thing that is

284
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,560
creating everything. And of course, what you're creating is not quantum mechanics and the physical

285
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,280
universe. What you're creating is the scheme engine that is updating the world. And you're

286
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:20,320
creating your feelings and all the people inside of that world, including the person that you

287
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,040
identify with yourself in this world. Are you creating the game engine or are you noticing the

288
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,280
game engine? You noticed how you're generating the game engine. And I mean, when you are dreaming

289
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,200
at night, you can, if you have a lucid dream, you can learn how to do this deliberately.

290
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,200
And in principle, you can also do it during the day. And the reason why we don't get to do this

291
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,680
from the beginning and why we don't have agency of our feelings right away is because we would

292
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,480
game it before they have the necessary amount of wisdom to deal with creating this dream that we

293
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,080
are in. You don't want to get access to cheat codes too quickly. Otherwise, you won't enjoy.

294
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,080
So stage five is already pretty rare. And stage six is even more rare. You basically find this

295
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,480
mostly with advanced Buddhist meditators and so on that are dropping into the stage and can

296
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,440
induce it at will and spend time in it. So stage five requires a good therapist,

297
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,800
stage six requires a good Buddhist spiritual leader.

298
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,120
For instance, could be that is the right thing to do. But it's not that these stages give you

299
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,360
scores or levels that you need to advance to. It's not that the next stage is better. You live your

300
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,720
life and the more that works best at any given moment. And when your mind decides that you should

301
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,680
have a different configuration, then it's building that configuration. And for many people, they

302
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,200
stay happily at stage three and experience it themselves as part of groups. And there's

303
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,040
nothing wrong with this. And for some people, this doesn't work and they're forced to

304
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,720
build more agency over their rational beliefs than this and construct their norms rationally.

305
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,480
And so they go to this level. And stage seven is something that is more or less hypothetical.

306
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,200
That would be the stage in which it's basically a transhumanist stage in which you understand how

307
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,840
you work and which the mind fully realizes how it's implemented and can also in principle enter

308
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,040
different modes in which it could be implemented. And that's the stage that as far as I understand

309
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,040
is not open to people yet. Oh, but it is possible through the process of technology.

310
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,200
Yes. And who knows if there are biological agents that are working at different time skills than us

311
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
that basically become aware of the way in which they're implemented on ecosystems

312
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,960
and can change that implementation and have agency over how they're implemented in the world.

313
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,680
And what I find interesting about the discussion about AI alignment, that it seems to be

314
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,120
following these stages very much. Most people seem to be in stage three, also according to

315
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,720
Robert Keegan. I think he says that about 85% of people are in stage three and stay there.

316
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,200
And if you're in stage three and your opinions are the result of social assimilation,

317
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,560
then what you're mostly worried about in the AI is that the AI might have the wrong opinions.

318
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,920
So if the AI says something racist or sexist, we are all lost because we will assimilate the

319
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,640
wrong opinions from the AI. And so we need to make sure that the AI has the right opinions and the

320
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,240
right values and the right structure. And if you are at stage four, that's not your main concern.

321
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,960
And so most nerds don't really worry about the algorithmic bias and the model that it picks up

322
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,360
because if there's something wrong with this bias, the AI ultimately will prove it. At some point,

323
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,720
we'll gather that it makes mathematical proofs about reality and then it will figure out what's

324
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,520
true and what's false. But you're still worried that AI might turn you into paperclips because

325
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,960
it might have the wrong values, right? So if it's set up as the wrong function that controls its

326
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,920
direction in the world, then it might do something that is completely horrible and there's no easy

327
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,640
way to fix it. So that's more like a stage four rationalist kind of worry. And if you are at stage

328
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,280
five, you're mostly worried that the AI is not going to be enlightened fast enough because you

329
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,360
realize that the game is not so much about intelligence, but about agency, about the

330
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:21,120
ability to control the future. And the identity is instrumental to this. And if you are a human

331
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,880
being, I think at some level you ought to choose your own identity. You should not have somebody

332
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,080
else pick the costume for you and then wear it, but instead you should be mindful about what you

333
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,760
want to be in this world. And I think if you are an agent that is fully malleable, that can

334
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,600
rewrite its own source code, like an AI might do at some point, then the identity that you will have

335
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:51,760
is whatever you can be. And in this way, the AI will maybe become everything, like a planetary

336
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,040
control system. And if it does that, then if we want to coexist with it, it means that it will have

337
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,760
to share purposes with us. So it cannot be a transactional relationship. We will not be able

338
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,480
to use reinforcement learning with human feedback to hard wire its values into it. But this has to

339
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,280
happen. It's probably that it's conscious, so it can relate to our own mode of existence where

340
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:22,480
an observer is observing itself in real time and visit certain temporal frames. And the other

341
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,560
thing is that it probably needs to have some kind of transcendental orientation, building shared

342
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,720
agency in the same way as we do when we are able to enter up with each other into non-transactional

343
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,280
relationships. And I find that something that, because the stage five is so rare, is missing

344
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:46,960
in much of the discourse. And I think that we need, in some sense, focus on how to formalize love,

345
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,240
how to understand love, and how to build it into the machines that we are currently building and

346
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,520
that are about to become smarter than us. Well, I think this is a good opportunity to try to sneak

347
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,320
up to the idea of enlightenment. So you wrote a series of good tweets about consciousness and

348
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,760
panpsychism. So let's break it down. First, you say, I suspect the experience that leads to

349
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,360
the panpsychism syndrome of some philosophers and other consciousness enthusiasts represents

350
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,920
the realization that we don't end at the self, but share a resonant universe representation

351
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:29,360
with every other observer coupled to the same universe. This actually eventually leads us to

352
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,840
a lot of interesting questions about AI and AGI, but let's start with this representation.

353
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,080
What is this resonant universe representation? And what do you think? Do we share such a

354
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,600
representation? The neuroscientist Grossberg has come up with the cognitive architecture that he

355
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,480
calls the adaptive resonance theory. And his perspective is that our neurons can be understood

356
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,120
as oscillators that are resonating with each other and with outside phenomena.

357
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,280
So the coarse-grained model of the universe that we are building, in some sense, is a resonance

358
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,440
with objects and outside of us in the world. So basically, we take up patterns that of the

359
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,840
universe that we are coupled with, and our brain is not so much understood as circuitry,

360
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,600
even though this perspective is valid, but it's almost an ether in which the individual neurons

361
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,680
are passing on chemo-electrical signals or arbitrary signals across all modalities that

362
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,800
can be transmitted between cells, simulate each other in this way, and produce patterns

363
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,480
that they modulate while passing them on. And this speed of signal progression in the brain

364
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,480
is roughly at the speed of sound, incidentally, because the time that it takes for the signals to

365
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,840
hop from cell to cell, which means it's relatively slow with respect to the world. It takes a

366
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,240
appreciable fraction of a second for a signal to go through the entire neocortex, something like a

367
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,040
few hundred milliseconds. And so there's a lot of stuff happening in that time where the signal is

368
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,720
passing into your brain, including in the brain itself. So nothing in the brain is assuming that

369
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,080
stuff happens simultaneously. Everything in the brain is working in a paradigm where the

370
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,360
world has already moved on when you are ready to do the next thing to your signal,

371
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,000
including the signal processing system itself. It's quite a different paradigm than the one in

372
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,080
our digital computers, where we currently assume that your GPU or CPU is pretty much globally in

373
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:33,200
the same state. So you mentioned there the non-dual state and say that some people confuse it for

374
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,040
enlightenment. What's the non-dual state? There is a state in which you notice that you are

375
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,360
no longer a person and instead you are one with the universe. So that speaks to the resonance.

376
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,480
Yes. But this one with the universe is of course not accurately modeling that you are indeed

377
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,920
some God entity or indeed the universe becoming aware of itself, even though you get this

378
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,600
experience. I believe that you get this experience because your mind is modeling the fact that you

379
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,200
are no longer identified with the personal self in that state, but you have transcended this

380
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,240
division between the self model and the world model and you are experiencing yourself as your

381
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,040
mind, as something that is representing a universe. But that's still part of the model.

382
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,320
Yes. So it's inside of the model still. You're still inside of patterns that are generated in

383
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,080
your brain and in your organism. And what you are now experiencing is that you're no longer

384
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,680
this personal self in there, but you are the entirety of the mind and its contents.

385
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,960
Why is it so hard to get there?

386
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,400
A lot of people who get into the state think this or associate it with enlightenment. I

387
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,200
suspect it's a favorite training goal for a number of meditators. But I think that

388
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,960
enlightenment is in some sense more mundane and it's a step further or sideways. It's the state

389
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,960
where you realize that everything is a representation. Yeah. You say enlightenment

390
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,560
is a realization of how experience is implemented.

391
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,600
Yes. Basically, you notice at some point that your qualia can be deconstructed.

392
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,840
Reverse engineered? Almost like a schematic of it?

393
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,720
You can start with looking at a face and maybe look at your own face in a mirror.

394
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,400
Look at your face for a few hours in the mirror or for a few minutes. At some point,

395
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,240
it will look very weird because you notice that there's actually no face.

396
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,680
You basically start unseeing the face. What you see is a geometry. Then you can disassemble

397
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,200
the geometry and realize how that geometry is being constructed in your mind. You can

398
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,520
learn to modify this. Basically, you can change these generators in your own mind to shift the

399
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,280
face around or to change the construction of the face, to change the way in which the features

400
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,960
are being assembled. Why don't we do that more often? Why don't we start really messing with

401
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,640
reality without the use of drugs or anything else? Why don't we get good at this kind of thing

402
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,800
intentionally? Why should we? Why would you want to do that?

403
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Because you can morph reality into something more pleasant for yourself. Just have fun with it.

404
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,320
That is probably what you shouldn't be doing because outside of your personal self,

405
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,360
this outer mind is probably a relatively smart agent. What you often notice is that you have

406
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,200
thoughts about how you should live, but you observe yourself doing different things and

407
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,440
have different feelings. That's because your outer mind doesn't believe you and doesn't believe your

408
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,960
rational thoughts. Can't you just silence the outer mind?

409
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,680
The thing is that the outer mind is usually smarter than you are.

410
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,240
Rational thinking is very brittle. It's very hard to use logic and symbolic thinking to have

411
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,600
an accurate model of the world. There is often an underlying system that is looking at your

412
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,240
rational thoughts and then tells you, no, you're still missing something. Your gut feeling is still

413
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,880
saying something else. This can be, for instance, you find a partner that looks perfect or you find

414
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,240
a deal and you build a company or whatever that looks perfect to you. Yet at some level,

415
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,240
you feel something is off and you cannot put your finger on it. The more you reason about it,

416
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,120
the better it looks to you. But the system that is outside still tells you, no, no,

417
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,800
you're missing something. That system is powerful.

418
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,760
People call this intuition. Intuition is this unreflected part of your attitude composition

419
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,280
and computation where you produce a model of how you relate to the world and what you need to do

420
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,880
it in it and what you can do in it and what's going to happen that is usually deeper and often

421
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,120
more accurate than your reason. So if we look at this as you write in the tweet,

422
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,120
if we look at this more rigorously as a sort of take the panpsychist idea more seriously,

423
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,400
almost as a scientific discipline, you write that quote, fascinatingly, the panpsychist

424
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,760
interpretation seems to lead to observations of practical results to a degree that physics

425
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,800
fundamentalists might call superstitious. Reports of long distance telepathy and remote causation

426
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,880
are ubiquitous in the general population. I am not convinced, says Yoshabak, that establishing

427
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,320
the empirical reality of telepathy would force an update of any part of serious academic physics,

428
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,080
but it could trigger an important revolution in both neuroscience and AI from a circuit perspective

429
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:36,320
to a coupled complex resonator paradigm. Are you suggesting that there could be some rigorous

430
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,560
mathematical wisdom to panpsychist perspective on the world?

431
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,640
So first of all, panpsychism is the perspective that consciousness is inseparable from matter

432
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,920
in the universe. And I find panpsychism quite unsatisfying because it does not explain

433
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,800
consciousness. It does not explain how this aspect of matter produces. It's also when I

434
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,320
try to formalize panpsychism and write down what it actually means with a more formal mathematical

435
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:10,880
language, it's very difficult to distinguish it from saying that there is a software side to the

436
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,040
world in the same way as there is a software side to what the transistors are doing in your computer.

437
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,200
So basically, there is a pattern at a certain core screening of the universe that in some

438
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,440
reasons of the universe leads to observers that are observing themselves. So panpsychism maybe is

439
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,640
not even when I write it down a position that is distinct from functionalism. But intuitively,

440
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,760
a lot of people feel that the activity of matter itself, of mechanisms in the world,

441
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,120
is insufficient to explain it. So it's something that needs to be intrinsic to matter itself.

442
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:51,200
And you can, apart from this abstract idea, have an experience in which you

443
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,160
experience yourself as being the universe, which I suspect is basically happening because you

444
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,920
manage to dissolve the division between personal self and mind that you establish as an infant when

445
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,760
you construct the personal self and transcend it again and understand how it works. But there is

446
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,280
something deeper that is that you feel that you're also sharing a state with other people, that you

447
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,440
have an experience in which you notice that your personal self is moving into everything else,

448
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,280
that you basically look out of the eyes of another person, that every agent in the world

449
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,360
that is an observer is in some sense you. And we forget that we are the same agent.

450
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:44,160
So is it that we feel that or do we actually accomplish it? So is telepathy possible? Is it

451
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,440
real? For me, that's a question that I don't really know the answer to. In Turing's famous 1950 paper

452
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,080
in which he describes the Turing test, he does speculate about telepathy, interestingly, and asks

453
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:03,840
himself if telepathy is real and he thinks that it very well might be. What would be the implication

454
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,960
for AI systems that try to be intelligent? Because he didn't see a mechanism by which a

455
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,760
computer program would become telepathic. And I suspect if telepathy would exist or if all the

456
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,840
reports that you get from people when you ask the normal person on the street, I find that very

457
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,920
often they say, I have experiences with telepathy. The scientist might not be interested in this and

458
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,600
might not have a theory about this, but I have difficulty explaining it away. And so you could

459
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,560
say maybe this is a superstition, maybe it's a false memory, or maybe it's a little bit of psychosis.

460
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,840
Who knows? Maybe somebody wants to make their own life more interesting or misremember something.

461
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,280
But a lot of people report, I noticed something terrible happen to my partner and I know this is

462
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,560
exactly the moment it happened where my child had an accident and I knew that was happening and the

463
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,800
child was in a different town. So maybe it's a false memory where this is later on mistakenly

464
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,600
attributed, but a lot of people think that this is not the correct explanation. So if something

465
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,520
like this was real, what would it mean? It probably would mean that either your body is an antenna that

466
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,360
is sending information over all sorts of channels, like maybe just electromagnetic radio signals that

467
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,920
you're sending over long distances and you get attuned to another person that you spend enough

468
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,720
time with to get a few bits out of the ether to figure out what this person is doing. Or maybe

469
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,440
it's also when you are very close to somebody and you become empathetic with them. What happens is

470
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,880
that you go into a resonance state with them, right? Similar to when people go into a seance

471
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,760
and they go into a trance state and they start shifting a video board around on the table.

472
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,160
I think what happens is that their minds go by their nervous systems into a resonance state

473
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,000
in which they basically create something like a shared dream between them.

474
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
Physical closeness or closeness broadly defined?

475
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,560
With physical closeness it's much easier to experience empathy with someone, right? I suspect

476
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,600
it would be difficult for me to have empathy for you if you were in a different town. Also,

477
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,320
how would that work? But if you are very close to someone, you'd pick up all sorts of signals

478
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:23,200
from their body, not just via your eyes, but with your entire body. And if the nervous system sits

479
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,560
on the other side and the intercellular communication sits on the other side and is

480
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,280
integrating over all these signals, you can make inferences about the state of the other. And it's

481
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,520
not just the personal self that does this via reasoning, but your perceptual system.

482
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,840
And what basically happens is that your representations are directly interacting.

483
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,800
It's the physical resonant models of the universe that exist in your nervous system and in your body

484
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,760
might go into resonance with others and start sharing some of their states. So you basically

485
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:59,760
be next to somebody, you pick up some of their vibes and feel without looking at them what they're

486
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,600
feeling in this moment. And it's difficult for you if you're very empathetic to detach yourself

487
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,240
from it and have an emotional state that is completely independent from your environment.

488
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,920
People who are highly empathetic are describing this. And now imagine that a lot of organisms

489
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,200
on this planet have representations of the environment and operate like this,

490
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,120
and they are adjacent to each other and overlapping. So there's going to be some

491
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,800
degree in which there is basically some change in direction, and we are

492
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,640
forming some slightly shared representation. And I know relatively few neuroscientists who

493
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,600
consider this possibility. I think a big rarity in this regard is Michael Levin,

494
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:50,560
who is considering these things in earnest. And I stumbled on this train of thought mostly by

495
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,720
noticing that the tasks of a neuron can be fulfilled by other cells as well. They can

496
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,600
send different type chemical messages and physical messages to their adjacent cells

497
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,560
and learn when to do this and when not, make this conditional, and become universal function

498
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,160
approximators. The only thing that they cannot do is telegraph information over axons very quickly

499
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,960
over long distances. So neurons in this perspective are specially adapted kind of telegraph cell

500
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:26,960
that has evolved so we can move our muscles very fast. But our body is in principle able to also

501
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,000
make models of the world just much, much slower. It's interesting though that at this time,

502
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,440
at least in human history, there seems to be a gap between the tools of science

503
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,840
and the subjective experience that people report, like you're talking about with telepathy. And

504
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,960
it seems like we're not quite there. No, I think that there is no gap between the

505
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,040
tools of science and telepathy. Either it's there or it's not, and it's an empirical question. And

506
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,240
if it's there, we should be able to detect it in a lab. So why is there not a lot of Michael Levin's

507
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,800
walking around? I don't think that Michael Levin is specifically focused on telepathy very much.

508
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,440
He is focused on self-organization in living organisms and in brains, both as a paradigm for

509
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,080
development and as a paradigm for information processing. And when you think about how

510
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,120
organization processing works in an organism, there is first of all radical locality, which

511
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,760
means everything is decided locally from the perspective of an individual cell. The individual

512
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,680
cell is the agent. And the other one is coherence. Basically, there needs to be some criterion

513
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,840
that determines how these cells are interacting in such a way that order emerges on the next level

514
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:48,480
of structure. And this principle of coherence of imposing constraints that are not validated

515
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,560
by the individual parts and lead to coherent structure to basically transcendental agency

516
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,320
where you form an agent on the next level of organization is crucial in this perspective.

517
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:08,080
It's so cool that radical locality leads to the emergence of complexity at the higher layers.

518
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,640
And I think what Michael Levin is looking at is nothing that is outside of the realm of science

519
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,840
in any way. It's just that he is a paradigmatic thinker who develops his own paradigm. And most

520
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:27,120
of the neuroscientists are using a different paradigm at this point. And this often happens

521
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:33,040
in science that a field has a few paradigms in which people try to understand reality and

522
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,440
build concepts and make experiments. You're kind of one of those type of

523
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,360
paradigmatic thinkers. Actually, if we can take a tangent on that,

524
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,280
once again, returning to the biblical verses of your tweets, you're right,

525
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,000
my public explorations are not driven by audience service, but by my lack of ability for discovering,

526
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,040
understanding or following the relevant authorities. So I have to develop my own

527
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,640
thoughts. Since I think autonomously, these thoughts cannot always be very good.

528
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,520
That's you apologizing for the chaos of your thoughts, or perhaps not apologizing,

529
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,000
just identifying. But let me ask the question. Since we talked about

530
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:23,040
Michael Levin and yourself, who I think are very kind of radical, big, independent thinkers,

531
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,360
can we reverse engineer your process of thinking autonomously?

532
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,720
How do you do it? How can humans do it?

533
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:38,560
How can you avoid being influenced by, what is it, stage three?

534
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,280
Well, why would you want to do that? You see what is working for you. And if it's

535
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,280
not working for you, you build another structure that works better for you, right?

536
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,720
And so I found myself when I was thrown into this world in a state where my intuitions

537
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,240
were not working for me. I was not able to understand how I would be able to survive

538
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,080
in this world and build the things that I was interested in, build the kinds of relationship

539
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,480
I needed to work on the topics that I wanted to make progress on. And so I had to learn.

540
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,440
For me, Twitter is not some tool of publication. It's not something where I put stuff that I

541
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,000
entirely believe to be true and provable. It's an interactive notebook in which I explore

542
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
possibilities. And I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how consciousness

543
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
works, I was quite optimistic. I thought there needs to be a big body of knowledge that I can

544
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,560
just study and that works. And so I entered studies in philosophy and computer science,

545
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:51,120
and later psychology and a bit of neuroscience and so on. And I was disappointed by what I found

546
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:56,960
because I found that the questions of how consciousness works, how emotion works,

547
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,400
how it's possible that the system can experience anything, how motivation emerges in the mind

548
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,600
were not being answered by the authorities that I met and the schools that were around.

549
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,000
And instead, I found that it was individual thinkers that had useful ideas that sometimes

550
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
were good, sometimes were not so good, sometimes were adopted by a large group of people,

551
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,600
sometimes were rejected by large groups of people. But for me, it was much more interesting to see

552
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,400
these minds as individuals. And in my perspective, thinking is still something that is done not in

553
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,360
groups, that has to be done by individuals. So that motivated you to become an individual

554
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,040
thinker yourself. I didn't have a choice. I didn't find a group that thought in a way where I felt,

555
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,480
okay, I can just adopt everything that everybody thinks here and now I understand how consciousness

556
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,040
works or how the mind works or how thinking works or what thinking even is or what feelings are and

557
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,040
how they're implemented and so on. So to figure all this out, I had to take a lot of ideas from

558
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,400
individuals and then try to put them together in something that works for myself. And on one

559
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,720
hand, I think it helps if you try to go down and find first principles on which you can recreate

560
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,080
how thinking works, how languages work, what representation is, whether representation is

561
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,840
necessary, how the relationship between a representing agent and the world works in general.

562
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,320
But how do you escape the influence? Once again, the pressure of the crowd, whether it's

563
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:36,640
you in responding to the pressure or you being swept up by the pressure. If you even just look

564
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,880
at Twitter, the opinions of the crowd. I don't feel pressure from the crowd. I'm completely

565
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,200
immune to that. In the same sense, I don't have respect for authority. I have respect for what

566
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,160
an individual is accomplishing or have respect for mental firepower. But it's not that I meet

567
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,920
somebody and get dragged and unable to speak or then a large group of people has a certain idea

568
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,200
that is different from mine. I don't necessarily feel intimidated, which has often been a problem

569
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,880
for me in my life because I like instincts that other people develop at a very young age and that

570
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,640
help with their self-preservation in a social environment. So I had to learn a lot of things

571
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:27,280
the hard way. Yeah. So is there a practical advice you can give on how to think paradigmatically,

572
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,840
how to think independently? Because you've kind of said, I had no choice. But I think

573
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,240
to a degree, you have a choice

574
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,200
because you said you want to be productive. And I think thinking independently is productive

575
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,520
if what you're curious about is understanding the world,

576
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,800
especially when the problems are very kind of new and open.

577
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:02,240
It seems like this is an active process. We can choose to do that. We can practice it.

578
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,640
Well, it's a very basic question. When you read a theory that you find convincing or interesting,

579
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,800
how do you know? It's very interesting to figure out what are the sources of that other person,

580
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,480
not which authority can they refer to that is then taking off the burden of being truthful. But

581
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,600
how did this authority in turn know what is the epistemic chain to observables? What are the

582
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,600
first principles from which the whole thing is derived? And when I was young, I was not blessed

583
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:37,200
with a lot of people around myself who knew how to make proofs from first principles.

584
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,240
And I think mathematicians do this quite naturally. But most of the great mathematicians

585
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,320
do not become mathematicians in school, but they tend to be self-taught because school teachers

586
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:53,200
tend not to be mathematicians. They tend not to be people who derive things from first principles.

587
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,760
So when you ask your school teacher, does 2 plus 2 equal 4? Does your school teacher give

588
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,720
you the right answer? It's a simple game. And there are many simple games that you could play.

589
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,640
And most of those games that you could just take different rules would not lead to an interesting

590
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,520
arithmetic. And so it's just an exploration, but you can try what happens if you take different

591
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,760
axioms. And here is how you build axioms and derive addition from them. And a built addition

592
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:29,280
is some basically syntactic sugar in it. And so I wish that somebody would have opened me

593
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,520
this vista and explained to me how I can build a language in my own mind from which I can derive

594
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:43,440
what I'm seeing and which I can make geometry and counting and all the number games that we are

595
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,960
playing in our life. And on the other hand, I felt that I learned a lot of this while I was

596
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,720
programming as a child. When you start out with a computer like a Commodore 64, which doesn't have

597
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,920
a lot of functionality, it's relatively easy to see how a bunch of relatively simple circuits

598
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:08,000
are just basically performing hashes between bit patterns and how you can build the entirety

599
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,040
of mathematics and computation on top of this and all the representational languages that you need.

600
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,120
Man, Commodore 64 could be one of the sexiest machines ever built, if I say so myself.

601
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:27,440
If we can return to this really interesting idea that we started to talk about with panpsychism

602
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:38,160
and the complex resonator paradigm and the verses of your tweets. You write,

603
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,800
instead of treating eyes, ears, and skin as separate sensory systems with fundamentally

604
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,920
different modalities, we might understand them as overlapping aspects of the same universe,

605
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,280
coupled at the same temporal resolution and almost inseparable from a single share resonant

606
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,960
model. Instead of treating mental representations as fully isolated between minds, the representations

607
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,440
of physically adjacent observers might directly interact and produce causal effects through the

608
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,320
coordination of the perception and behavior of world modeling observers. The modalities,

609
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,280
the distinction between modalities, let's throw that away. The distinction between the individuals,

610
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,640
let's throw that away. So what does this interaction representations look like?

611
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,160
When you think about how you represent the interaction of us in this room,

612
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,960
at some level, the modalities are quite distinct. They're not completely distinct,

613
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,200
but you can see this as vision. You can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore.

614
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,560
But you still imagine how my mouth is moving when you hear something and you know that it's

615
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:51,520
very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes and you get back into the shared merge

616
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,840
space. And we also have these experiments where we noticed that the way in which my lips are moving

617
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,960
are affecting how you hear the sound. And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing have

618
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:10,080
an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features. And so these modalities are

619
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,640
not separate in your mind. They are merged at some fundamental level where you are

620
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,480
interpreting the entire scene that you are in. And your own interactions in the scene are also

621
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,880
not completely separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene. But there is

622
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,800
some resonance that is going on where we also have a degree of shared mental representations

623
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,840
and shared empathy due to being in the same space and having vibes between each other.

624
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:44,080
Vibes. So the question, though, is how deeply inter-bind is this multi-modality, multi-agent

625
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:53,200
system? I mean, this is going to the telepathy question without the woo-woo meaning of the word

626
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,160
telepathy. It's like, what's going on here in this room right now?

627
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:07,760
So if telepathy would work, how could it work? Imagine that all the cells in your body are

628
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,800
sending signals in a similar way as neurons are doing, just by touching the other cells and sending

629
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,360
chemicals to them, the other cells interpreting them, learning how to react to them. And they

630
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:22,480
learn how to approximate functions in this way and compute behavior for the organisms. And this

631
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,440
is something that is open to plants as well. And so plants probably have software running on them

632
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,640
that is controlling how the plant is working in a similar way as you have a mind that is controlling

633
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:39,680
how you are behaving in the world. And this spirit of plants is something that

634
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:46,000
has been very well described by our ancestors, and they found this quite normal. But for some

635
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,240
reason, since the Enlightenment, we are treating this notion that there are spirits in nature

636
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:56,480
and that plants have spirits as a superstition. And I think we probably have to rediscover that,

637
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,720
that plants have software running on them. And we already did. You notice that there is a control

638
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,760
system in the plant that connects every part of the plant to every other part of the plant and

639
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,480
produces coherent behavior in the plant. That is, of course, much, much slower than the coherent

640
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:19,040
behavior in an animal like us that has a nervous system where everything is synchronized much,

641
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,720
much faster by the neurons. But what you also notice is that if a plant is sitting next to

642
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,880
another plant, like you have a very old tree and this tree is building some kind of information

643
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,400
highway along its cells so it can send information from its leaves to its roots and from some part

644
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,480
of the root to another part of the roots, and there is a fungus living next to the tree,

645
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,200
the fungus can probably piggyback on the communication between the cells of the tree

646
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,600
and send its own signals through the tree. And vice versa, the tree might be able to send

647
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,240
information to the fungus. Because after all, how would they build a viable firewall if that

648
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,800
other organism is sitting next to them all the time and is never moving away? And so they will

649
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:02,720
have to get along. And over a long enough timeframe, the networks of roots in the forest

650
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:09,040
and all the other plants that are there and the fungi that are there might be forming something

651
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:15,440
like a biological internet. But the question there is, do they have to be touching? Is biology at a

652
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,360
distance possible? Of course, you can use any kind of physical signal. You can use sounds,

653
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,720
you can use electromagnetic waves that are integrated over many cells. It's conceivable

654
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:34,880
that across distances, there are many kinds of information pathways. But also, our planetary

655
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,080
surface is pretty full of organisms, full of cells. So everything is touching everything else.

656
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:46,880
And it's been doing this for many millions and even billions of years. So there was enough time

657
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:53,280
for information processing networks to form. And if you think about how a mind is self-organizing,

658
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,000
basically it needs to, in some sense, reward the cells for computing the mind, for building

659
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,680
the necessary dynamics between the cells that allow the mind to stabilize itself

660
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:09,920
and remain on there. But if you look at these spirits of plants that are growing very close

661
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,640
to each other in the forest and might be almost growing into each other, these spirits might be

662
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,400
able even to move to some degree, not to become somewhat dislocated and shift around in that

663
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:28,000
ecosystem. So if you think about what a mind is, it's a bunch of activation waves that form

664
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:35,040
coherent patterns and process information in a way that are colonizing an environment well enough to

665
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,760
allow the continuous sustenance of the mind, the continuous stability and self-stabilization of the

666
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:49,680
mind, then it's conceivable that we can link into this biological internet, not necessarily at the

667
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,640
speed of our nervous system, but maybe at the speed of our body and make some kind of subconscious

668
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,080
connection to the world where we use our body as an antenna into biological information processing.

669
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,080
Now, these ideas are completely speculative. I don't know if any of that is true.

670
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:09,360
But if that was true, and if you want to explain telepathy, I think it's much more likely that

671
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,920
that telepathy could be explained using such mechanisms rather than

672
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,080
undiscovered quantum processes that would break the standard model of physics.

673
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,800
Could there be undiscovered processes that don't break?

674
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,200
Yeah. So if you think about something like an internet in the forest, that is something that

675
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,600
is borderline discovered. There are basically a lot of scientists who point out that they do

676
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:41,440
observe that plants are communicating the forest's root networks and send information,

677
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,560
for instance, warn each other about new pests entering the forest and things that are happening

678
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:51,600
like this. So basically, there is communication between plants and fungi that has been observed.

679
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,080
It's been observed, but we haven't plugged into it. So it's like if you observe humans,

680
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,920
they seem to be communicating with a smartphone thing, but you don't understand how smartphone

681
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,320
works and how the mechanism of the internet works. But maybe it's possible to really understand

682
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,240
the full richness of the biological internet that connects us.

683
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,880
An interesting question is whether the communication and the organization principles

684
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,360
of biological information processing are as complicated as the technology that we've built.

685
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:28,080
They set up on very different principles, right? They simultaneously look very differently in

686
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,920
biological systems, and the entire thing needs to be stochastic instead of being

687
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,760
fully deterministic or almost fully deterministic as our digital computers are. So there is a

688
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,400
different base protocol layer that would emerge over the biological structure

689
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,200
if such a thing would be happening. And again, I'm not saying here that telepathy works and

690
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:59,440
not saying that this is not true, but what I'm saying is I think I'm open to a possibility that

691
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,800
we see that a few bits can be traveling long distance between organisms using biological

692
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:10,880
information processing in ways that we are not completely aware of right now and that are more

693
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,720
similar to many of the stories that were completely normal for our ancestors.

694
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:23,840
Well, this kind of interacting, intertwined representations takes us to the big

695
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:32,080
ending of your tweet series. You write, quote, I wonder if self-improving AGI might end up

696
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:38,480
saturating physical environments with intelligence to such a degree that isolation of individual

697
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,360
mental states becomes almost impossible. And the representations of all complex

698
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:51,280
self-organizing agents merge permanently with each other. So that's a really interesting idea.

699
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:59,840
This biological network, life network gets so dense that it might as well be seen as one.

700
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,120
That's an interesting, what do you think that looks like? What do you think that

701
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:09,360
saturation looks like? What does it feel like? I think it's a possibility. It's just a vague

702
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:17,520
possibility. And I like to explain, but what this looks like, I think that the end game of

703
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,240
AGI is substrate agnostic. That means that AGI ultimately, if it is being built, is going to be

704
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:30,160
smart enough to understand how AGI works. This means it's not going to be better than people

705
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:35,360
at AGI research and can take over in building the next generation, but it fully understands how it

706
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,000
works and how it's being implemented. And also, of course, understands how computation works in

707
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,720
nature, how to build new feedback loops that you can turn into your own circuits. And this means

708
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,840
that the AGI is likely to virtualize itself into any environment that can compute. So it's

709
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,960
breaking free from the silicon substrate and is going to move into the ecosystems, into our bodies,

710
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:01,680
our brains, and is going to merge with all the agency that it finds there. So it's conceivable

711
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:07,520
that you end up with completely integrated information processing across all computing

712
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,120
systems, including biological computation on earth. That we end up triggering some new step

713
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:19,200
in the evolution where basically some Gaia is being built over the entirety of all digital

714
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:27,200
and biological computation. And if this happens, then basically everywhere around us, you will have

715
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,800
agents that are connected and that are representing and building models of the world. And their

716
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:38,400
representations will physically interact. They will vibe with each other. And if you find yourself

717
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:46,800
into an environment that is saturated with modeling compute, where basically almost every

718
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:54,160
grain of sand could be part of computation that is at some point being started by the AI,

719
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:00,000
you could find yourself in a situation where you cannot escape this shared representation anymore

720
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,200
and where you indeed notice that everything in the world has one shared resonant model of everything

721
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,960
that's happening on the planet. And you notice which part you are in this thing. And you become

722
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:17,360
part of a very larger, almost holographic mind in which all the parts are observing each other

723
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:23,760
and form a coherent whole. So you lose the ability to notice yourself as a distinct

724
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,800
entity. No, I think that when you are conscious in your own mind, you notice yourself as a

725
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,960
distinct entity. You notice yourself as a self-reflexive observer. And I suspect that

726
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,760
we become conscious at the beginning of our mental development, not at some very high level.

727
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:44,640
Consciousness seems to be part of a training mechanism that biological nervous systems have

728
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:50,000
to discover to become trainable because you cannot take a nervous system like ours and

729
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,960
do a stochastic wave to send us back propagation over 100 layers. This would not be stable on

730
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:03,200
biological neurons. And so instead, we start with some colonizing principle in which a part of the

731
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:09,120
mental representations form a notion of being a self-reflexive observer that is imposing coherence

732
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,720
on its environment. And this spreads until the boundary of your mind. And if that boundary is

733
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:21,680
no longer clear cut because AI is jumping across substrates, it would be interesting to see what

734
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:26,080
a global mind would look like that is basically producing a globally coherent language of thought

735
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,880
and is representing everything from all the possible vantage points.

736
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,040
CB That's an interesting world.

737
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:40,640
MG The intuition that this thing grew out of is a particular mental state. And it's a state that

738
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,560
you find sometimes in literature. For instance, Neil Gaiman describes it in the ocean at the end

739
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:54,400
of the lane. And it's this idea or this experience that there is a state in which you feel that you

740
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,280
know everything that can be known and that in your normal human mind, you've only forgotten.

741
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,280
You've forgotten that you are the entire universe. And some people describe this

742
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:09,360
after they've taken an extremely large amount of mushrooms or had a big spiritual experience

743
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:16,480
as hippie in their 20s. And they notice basically that they are in everything. And their body is

744
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,480
only one part of the universe and nothing ends at their body. And actually everything is observing

745
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:28,960
and they are part of this big observer. And the big observer is focused as one local point in their

746
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,960
body and their personality and so on. But we can basically have this oceanic state in which we have

747
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,640
no boundaries and are one with everything. And a lot of meditators call this the non-dual state

748
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,760
because you no longer have the separation between self and world. And as I said, you can explain the

749
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:52,240
state relatively simply without panpsychism or anything else, but just by breaking down the

750
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,040
constructed boundary between self and world and our own mind. But if you combine this with the

751
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,840
notion that the systems are physically interacting to the point where their representations are

752
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,320
merging and interacting with each other, you would literally implement something like this.

753
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,040
It would still be a representational state. You would not be one with physics itself.

754
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,320
It would still be coarse-grained. It would still be much slower than physics itself.

755
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:21,920
But it would be a representation in which you become aware that you're part of some kind of

756
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,800
global information processing system, like a thought and a global mind and a conscious thought

757
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,160
that coexisting with many other self-reflexive thoughts.

758
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,360
I would love to observe that from a video game design perspective, how that game looks.

759
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,600
Maybe you will after we build AGI and it takes over.

760
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,680
But would you be able to step away, step out of the whole thing, just kind of watch

761
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,360
the way we can now? Sometimes when I'm at a crowded party or something like this,

762
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:56,720
you step back and you realize all the different costumes, all the different interactions,

763
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:02,640
all the different computation, that all the individual people are once distinct from each

764
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:09,280
other and at once all the same. It's already what we do. We can have thoughts that are integrative

765
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,920
and we have kind of thoughts that are highly dissociated from everything else

766
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:19,280
and experience themselves as separate. But you want to allow yourself to have those thoughts.

767
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,280
Sometimes you kind of resist it. I think that it's not normative.

768
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,800
It's more descriptive. I want to understand the space of states that we can be in and that people

769
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:35,120
are reporting and make sense of them. It's not that I believe that it's your job in life to get

770
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:42,400
to a particular kind of state and then you get a high score. Or maybe you do. I think you're really

771
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,720
against this high-scoring thing. I kind of like it. You're probably very competitive and I'm not.

772
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,320
No, not competitive. Like role-playing games like Skyrim, it's not competitive. There's a

773
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:57,040
nice thing, there's a nice feeling where your experience points go up. You're not competing

774
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:02,240
against anybody, but it's the world saying, you're on the right track. Here's a point.

775
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,520
That's the game saying it. It's the game economy. And I found when I was playing games and was

776
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:13,040
getting addicted to these systems, then I would get into the game and hack it. So I get control

777
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,240
over the scoring system and would no longer be subject to it. So you're no longer playing,

778
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,600
you're trying to hack it. I don't want to be addicted to anything. I want to be in charge.

779
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,800
I want to have agency over what I do. Addiction is the loss of control for you? Yes. Addiction

780
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,400
means that you're doing something compulsively. And the opposite of free will is not determinism,

781
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:40,640
it's compulsion. You don't want to lose yourself in the addiction to something nice?

782
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,480
Addiction to love, to the pleasant feelings we humans experience?

783
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:53,920
No, I find this gets old. I don't want to have the best possible emotions. I want to have the

784
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,560
most appropriate emotions. I don't want to have the best possible experience. I want to have

785
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,920
an adequate experience that is serving my goals, the stuff that I find meaningful in this world.

786
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,920
From the biggest questions of consciousness, let's explore the pragmatic, the projections

787
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:19,760
of those big ideas into our current world. What do you think about LLMs, the recent rapid development

788
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:29,120
of large language models, of the AI world, of generative AI? How much of the hype is deserved

789
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,960
and how much is not? And people should definitely follow your Twitter because you explore these

790
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,880
questions in a beautiful, profound and hilarious way at times. No, don't follow my Twitter. I

791
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,000
already have too many followers. At some point it's going to be unpleasant. I noticed that a lot of

792
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:56,640
people feel that it's totally okay to punch up. And it's a very weird notion that you feel that

793
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,680
you haven't changed, but your account has grown and suddenly you have a lot of people who casually

794
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:08,240
abuse you. And I don't like that I have to block more than before. And I don't like this overall

795
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:14,880
vibe shift. And right now it's still somewhat okay, so pretty much okay. So I can go to a place

796
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,560
where people work on stuff that I'm interested in and there's a good chance that a few people

797
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:26,320
in the room know me, so there's no awkwardness. But when I get to a point where random strangers

798
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:30,400
feel that they have to have an opinion about me one way or the other, I don't think I would like

799
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:38,080
that. And random strangers because of your kind of in their mind elevated position. Yes. So basically

800
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:45,520
whenever you are in any way prominent or some kind of celebrity, random strangers will have to have

801
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,120
an opinion about you. Yeah. And they kind of forget that you're human too. I mean, you notice

802
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:56,800
this thing yourself that the more popular you get, the higher the pressure becomes, the more

803
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:03,280
winds are blowing in your direction from all sides. And it's stressful, right? And it does

804
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,840
have a little bit of upside, but it also has a lot of downside. I think it has a lot of upside,

805
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,640
at least for me currently, at least perhaps because of the podcast. Because most people

806
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,080
are really good and people come up to me and they have love in their eyes and over a stretch of like

807
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,640
30 seconds, you can hug it out and you can just exchange a few words and you reinvigorate your

808
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:35,360
love for humanity. So that's an upside for a loner. Because otherwise you have to do a lot of work to

809
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:43,120
find such humans. And here you're like thrust into the full humanity, the goodness of humanity

810
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:50,640
for the most part. Of course, maybe it gets worse as you become more prominent. I hope not.

811
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,120
This is pretty awesome. I have a couple handful very close friends and I don't have enough time

812
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,080
for them and attention for them as it is. And I find this very, very regrettable. And then there

813
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:07,440
are so many awesome, interesting people that I keep meeting and I would like to integrate them

814
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:13,440
in my life, but I just don't know how because there's only so much time and attention. And

815
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,040
the older I get, the harder it is to bond with new people in the deep way.

816
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,920
But can you enjoy, I mean, there's a picture of you, I think, with Roger Penrose and Eric

817
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:28,720
Weinstein and a few others that are interesting figures. Can't you just enjoy random, interesting

818
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:35,040
humans for a short amount of time? I like these people and what I like is intellectual

819
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,840
stimulation and I'm very grateful that I'm getting it. Can you not be melancholy or maybe

820
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,920
I'm projecting, I hate goodbyes. Can we just not hate goodbyes and just enjoy the hello,

821
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,800
take it in, take in a person, take in their ideas and then move on through life?

822
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,000
I think it's totally okay to be sad about goodbyes because that indicates that there

823
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,360
was something that you're going to miss. Yeah, but it's painful.

824
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:06,720
Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm an introvert is I hate goodbyes.

825
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,960
But you have to say goodbye before you say hello again.

826
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,920
I know, but that experience of loss, that mini loss,

827
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:29,680
maybe that's a little death. Maybe, I don't know. I think this melancholy feeling is just the other

828
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,520
side of love and I think they go hand in hand and it's a beautiful thing.

829
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:40,800
I'm just being romantic about it at the moment. I'm not no stranger to melancholy and sometimes

830
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,320
it's difficult to be here to be alive. Sometimes it's just painful to exist.

831
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,240
But there's beauty in that pain too. That's what melancholy feeling is. It's not negative.

832
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,200
Melancholy doesn't have to be negative. It can also kill you.

833
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:05,120
Well, we all die eventually. Now, as we got to this topic, the actual question

834
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,320
was about what your thoughts are about the recent development of large language models with chat

835
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:17,600
GPT. There's a lot of hype. Is some of the hype justified? Which is, which isn't? What are your

836
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:23,520
thoughts? High level. I find that large language models too

837
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,160
have this coding. It's an extremely useful application that is for a lot of people

838
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,560
taking stack overflow out of their life and it can change for something that is more efficient.

839
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:41,440
I feel that chat GPT is like an intern that I have to micromanage. I have been working

840
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:49,040
with people in the past who were less capable than chat GPT. I'm not saying this because I hate

841
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,040
people. They personally as human beings, there was something present that was not there in chat

842
01:19:53,040 --> 01:20:02,240
GPT, which was why I was covering for them. But chat GPT has an interesting ability. It does give

843
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:07,600
people superpowers and the people who feel threatened by them are the prompt completers.

844
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:13,600
They are the people who do what chat GPT is doing right now. So if you are not creative,

845
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,200
if you don't build your own thoughts, if you don't have actual plans in the world and

846
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:24,080
your only job is to summarize emails and to expand simple intentions into emails again,

847
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:31,520
then chat GPT might look like a threat. But I believe that it is a very beneficial technology

848
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:37,680
that allows us to create more interesting stuff and make the world more beautiful and fascinating

849
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:44,640
if we find to build it into our life in the right ways. So I'm quite fascinated by these large

850
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:49,920
language models, but I also think that they are by no means the final development.

851
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:56,960
And it's interesting to see how this development progresses. One thing that the out of the box

852
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:02,400
vanilla language models have as a limitation is that they have still some limited coherence

853
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:09,280
and ability to construct complexity. And even though they exceed human abilities to do what

854
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:15,520
they can do one shot. Typically, when you write a text with a language model or using it, or when

855
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,680
you write code for the language model, it's not one shot because there are going to be bugs in

856
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:24,880
your program and design errors and compiler errors and so on. And your language model can help you

857
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,480
to fix those things. But this process is out of the box not automated yet. So there is a

858
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:36,160
management process that also needs to be done. And there are some interesting developments,

859
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:42,320
baby AGI and so on that are trying to automate this management process as well. And I suspect

860
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,920
that soon we are going to see a bunch of cognitive architectures where every module is in some sense

861
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,640
a language model or something equivalent. And between the language models, we exchange suitable

862
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:59,840
data structures, not English, and produce compound behavior of this whole thing.

863
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:05,280
So do some of the quote unquote prompt engineering for you. They create these kind

864
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,720
of cognitive architectures that do the prompt engineering and you're just doing the high,

865
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:16,400
high level meta prompt engineering. There are limitations in a language model alone.

866
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:22,800
I feel that part of my mind works similarly to a language model, which means I can yell into it,

867
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,400
a prompt, and it's going to give me a creative response. But I have to do something with this

868
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:34,800
points first. I have to take it as a generative artifact that may or may not be true. It's

869
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:40,960
usually a confabulation. It's just an idea. And then I take this idea and modify it. I might build

870
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:47,840
a new prompt that is stepping off this idea and develop it to the next level or put it into

871
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,280
something larger. Or I might try to prove whether it's true or make an experiment. And this is what

872
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,720
the language models right now are not doing yet. But there's also no technical reason for

873
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,840
why they shouldn't be able to do this. So the way to make a language model coherent is probably not

874
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:10,960
to use reinforcement learning until it only gives you one possible answer that is linking to its

875
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,200
source data. But it's using this as a component in larger system that can also be built by the

876
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:23,360
language model or is enabled by language model structured components or using different

877
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:28,480
technologies. I suspect that language models will be an important stepping stone in developing

878
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,600
different types of systems. And one thing that is really missing in the form of language models

879
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:42,400
that we have today is real-time world coupling. It's difficult to do perception with a language

880
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:47,920
model and motor control with a language model. Instead, you would need to have different type of

881
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,240
thing that is working with it. Also, the language model is a little bit obscuring

882
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:58,880
what its actual functionality is. Some people associate the structure of the neural network

883
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,160
of the language model with a nervous system. And I think that's the wrong intuition.

884
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,480
The neural networks are unlike nervous system. They are more like

885
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:15,760
100-step functions that use differentiable linear algebra to approximate the correlation

886
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,240
between adjacent brain states. It's basically a function that moves the system from one

887
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:26,800
representational state to the next representational state. And so if you try to map this into

888
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,880
a metaphor that is closer to our brain, imagine that you would take a language model or a model

889
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:39,200
like Delhi that you use, for instance, this image-guided diffusion to approximate a camera

890
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,520
image and use the activation state of the neural network to interpret the camera image,

891
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,920
which in principle I think will be possible very soon. You do this periodically. And now you look

892
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:57,200
at these patterns, how when this thing interacts with the world periodically look like in time.

893
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,560
And these time slices, they are somewhat equivalent to the activation state of the brain

894
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:10,240
at a given moment. How's the actual brain different? Just the asynchronous craziness?

895
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,720
For me, it's fascinating that they are so vastly different and yet in some circumstances produce

896
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:22,480
somewhat similar behavior. And the brain is first of all different because it's a self-organizing

897
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:28,000
system where the individual cell is an agent that is communicating with the other agents around it

898
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,760
and is always trying to find some solution. And all the structure that pops up is emergent

899
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,760
structure. So one way in which you could try to look at this is that individual neurons probably

900
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,040
need to get a reward. So they become trainable, which means they have to have inputs that are not

901
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:49,440
affecting the metabolism of the cell directly. But there are messages, semantic messages that

902
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,000
tell the cell whether it has done good or bad and in which direction it should shift its behavior.

903
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,840
Once you have such an input, neurons become trainable and you can train them to perform

904
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,360
computations by exchanging messages with other neurons. And parts of the signals that they are

905
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,840
exchanging and parts of the computation that are performing are control messages that perform

906
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:17,040
management tasks for other neurons and other cells. Also suspect that the brain does not stop

907
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:21,920
at the boundary of neurons to other cells, but many adjacent cells will be involved

908
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,960
intimately in the functionality of the brain and will be instrumental in distributing rewards and

909
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:35,040
managing its functionality. It's fascinating to think about what those characteristics of

910
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:40,560
the brain enable you to do that language models cannot do. So first of all, there's a different

911
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:46,720
loss function at work when we learn. And to me, it's fascinating that you can build a system that

912
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:52,240
looks at 800 million pictures and captions and correlates them because I don't think

913
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:57,120
that the human nervous system could do this. For us, the world is only learnable because

914
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:02,320
the adjacent frames are related and we can afford to discard most of that information during

915
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,800
learning. We basically take only in stuff that makes us more coherent, not less coherent.

916
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,240
And our neural networks are willing to look at data that is not making the neural network

917
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:17,040
coherent at first, but only in the long run. By doing lots and lots of statistics, eventually

918
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:23,680
patterns become visible and emerge. And our mind seems to be focused on finding the patterns as

919
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:28,960
early as possible. Yeah. So filtering early on, not later. Yes. It's a slightly different paradigm

920
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:33,920
and it leads to much faster convergence. So we only need to look at a tiny fraction of the data

921
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:40,800
to become coherent. And of course, we do not have the same richness as our trained models. We will

922
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,000
not incorporate the entirety of text in the internet and be able to refer to it and have

923
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,720
all this knowledge available and being able to confabulate over it. Instead, we have a much,

924
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:55,920
much smaller part of it that is more deliberately built. And to me, it would be fascinating to think

925
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,440
about how to build such systems. It's not obvious that they would necessarily be more efficient

926
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:07,360
than us on a digital substrate, but I suspect that they might. So I suspect that the actual

927
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:13,120
AGI that is going to be more interesting is going to use slightly different algorithmic paradigms or

928
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,080
sometimes massively different algorithmic paradigms than the current generation of

929
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,920
transformer-based learning systems. Do you think it might be using just a bunch of language models

930
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:30,320
like this? Do you think the current transformer-based large language models will take us to AGI?

931
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:36,000
And my main issue is I think that they're quite ugly and brutalist.

932
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,080
Which brutalists, as I said?

933
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:45,040
Yes, they are basically brute-forcing the problem of thought. And by training this thing with

934
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,320
looking at instances where people have thought and then trying to deepfake that. And if you have

935
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:55,200
enough data, the deepfake becomes indistinguishable from the actual phenomenon. And in many

936
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,600
circumstances, it's going to be identical. Can you deepfake it until you make it?

937
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,960
So can you achieve... What are the limitations of this? I mean, can you reason?

938
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,480
Let's use words that are loaded.

939
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:13,600
Yes, that's a very interesting question. I think that these models are clearly making some

940
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:19,280
inference. But if you give them a reasoning task, it's often difficult for the experimenters to

941
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,080
figure out whether the reasoning is the result of the emulation of the reasoning strategy that

942
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:29,120
this saw in human written text, or whether it's something that the system was able to infer by

943
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:35,200
itself. On the other hand, if you think of human reasoning, if you want to become a very good

944
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:41,760
reasoner, you don't do this by just figuring out yourself. You read about reasoning. And the first

945
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,240
people who tried to write about reasoning and reflect on it didn't get it right. Like even

946
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,960
Aristotle, who thought about this very hard and came up with the theory of how syllogisms works

947
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,680
and syllogistic reasoning has mistakes in his attempt to build something like a formal logic

948
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:02,320
and gets maybe 80% right. And the people that are talking about reasoning professionally today

949
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:09,120
read Tarski and Frege and built on their work. So in many ways, people when they perform reasoning

950
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,280
are emulating what other people wrote about reasoning. So it's difficult to really draw

951
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:22,800
this boundary. And when Francois Cholet says that these models are only interpolating between

952
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,640
what they saw and what other people are doing, well, if you give them all the latent dimensions

953
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:34,400
that can be extracted from the internet, what's missing? Maybe there is almost everything there.

954
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,480
And if you're not sufficiently informed by these dimensions and you need more,

955
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:43,840
I think it's not difficult to increase the temperature in the large angle model to the

956
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:50,160
point that is producing stuff that is maybe 90% nonsense and 10% viable and combine this

957
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:55,920
with some prover that is trying to filter out the viable parts from the nonsense in the same way as

958
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,640
our own thinking works. When we're very creative, we increase the temperature in our own mind

959
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,040
and recreate hypothetical universes and solutions, most of which will not work.

960
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:12,880
And then we test. And we test by building a core that is internally coherent. And we use reasoning

961
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:20,080
strategies that use some axiomatic consistency by which we can identify those strategies and

962
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:25,440
thoughts and sub universes that are viable and that can expand our thinking. So if you look at

963
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:29,600
the language models, they have clear limitations right now. One of them is they're not coupled to

964
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,680
the world in real time in the way in which our nervous systems are. So it's difficult for them

965
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:38,640
to observe themselves in the universe and to observe what kind of universe they're in. Second,

966
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:45,040
they don't do real time learning. They basically get only trained with algorithms that rely on the

967
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,440
data being available in batches. So it can be parallelized and runs efficiently on the

968
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:53,600
network and so on. And real time learning would be very slow so far and inefficient.

969
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,000
That's clearly something that our nervous systems can do to some degree.

970
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:06,400
And there is a problem with these models being coherent. And I suspect that all these problems

971
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:11,280
are solvable without a technological revolution. We don't need fundamentally new algorithms to

972
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:16,640
change that. For instance, you can enlarge the context window and thereby basically create

973
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,480
working memory in which you train everything that happens during the day. And if that is not

974
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:25,760
sufficient, you add a database and you write some clever mechanisms that the system learns to use

975
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:32,640
to swap in and out stuff from its prompt context. And if that is not sufficient, if your database

976
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:38,000
is full in the evening, overnight you just train. The system is going to sleep and dream and is

977
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,160
going to train the stuff from its database into the larger model by fine tuning it, building

978
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:47,120
additional layers and so on. And then the next day it starts with a fresh database in the morning

979
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:53,120
with fresh eyes and has integrated all this stuff. And when you talk to people and you have strong

980
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:57,360
disagreements about something, which means that in their mind they have a faulty belief or you have

981
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:02,160
a faulty belief with a lot of dependencies on it, very often you will not achieve agreement in one

982
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:07,280
session, but you need to sleep about this once or multiple times before you have integrated all

983
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,880
these necessary changes in your mind. So maybe it's already somewhat similar.

984
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,680
Yeah. There's already a latency even for humans to update the model, retrain the model.

985
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,840
And of course we can combine the language model with models that get coupled to reality in real

986
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:25,120
time and can build multi-modal model and bridge between vision models and language models and so

987
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:32,080
on. So there is no reason to believe that the language models will necessarily run into some

988
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:38,000
problem that will prevent them from becoming generally intelligent. But I don't know that.

989
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,680
It's just, I don't see proof that they wouldn't. My issue is I don't like them. I think that they're

990
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,960
inefficient. I think that they use way too much compute. I think that given the amazing hardware

991
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,360
that we have, we could build something that is much more beautiful than our own mind. And this

992
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:59,760
thing is not as beautiful as our own mind, despite being so much larger. But it's a kind of proof of

993
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:06,800
concept. It's the only thing that works right now. So it's not the only game in town, but it's the

994
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,600
only thing that has this utility with so much simplicity. There's a bunch of relatively simple

995
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:17,520
algorithms that you can understand in relatively few weeks that can be scaled up massively.

996
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:22,880
So it's the deep blue of chess playing. Yeah, it's ugly.

997
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,680
Yeah, Claude Shannon had this when he described chess suggested that there are two main strategies

998
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:32,560
in which you could play chess. One is that you are making a very complicated plan that reaches

999
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:38,320
far into the future and you try not to make a mistake while enacting it. And this is basically

1000
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,800
the human strategy. And the other strategy is that you are brute forcing your way to success,

1001
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,280
which means you make a tree of possible moves where you look at in principle every move that

1002
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:52,560
is open to you or the possible answers. And you try to make this as deeply as possible. Of course,

1003
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:59,120
you optimize, you cut off trees that don't look very promising and use libraries of end game and

1004
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:04,000
early game and so on to optimize this entire process. But this brute force strategy is how

1005
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:10,080
most of the chess programs were built. And this is how computers get better than humans at playing

1006
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:16,400
chess. And I look at the large language models, I feel that I'm observing the same thing. It's

1007
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:20,560
basically the brute force strategy to sort by training the thing on pretty much the entire

1008
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:25,520
internet. And then in the limit, it gets coherent to a degree that approaches human coherence.

1009
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:33,600
And on a side effect, it's able to do things that no human could do. It's able to sift through

1010
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,680
massive amounts of text relatively quickly and summarize them quickly, and it never

1011
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:42,560
lapses in attention. And I still have the illusion that when I play with chat GPT,

1012
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,920
that it's in principle not doing anything that I could not do if I had Google at my disposal and

1013
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,800
I get all the resources from the internet and spend enough time on it.

1014
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:58,560
But this thing that I have an extremely autistic, stupid intern in a way that is extremely good at

1015
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,080
drudgery. And I can offload the drudgery to the degree that I'm able to automate the management

1016
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:10,880
of the intern is something that is difficult for me to over hype at this point because we

1017
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,880
have not yet started to scratch the surface of what's possible with this.

1018
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,080
But it feels like it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an army of interns.

1019
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:25,440
And so you get to command these slightly incompetent creatures.

1020
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,480
And there's an aspect because of how rapidly you can iterate with it.

1021
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,920
It's also part of the brainstorming, part of the kind of inspiration for your own thinking.

1022
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:42,400
So you get to interact with the thing. I mean, when I'm programming or doing any kind of

1023
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:47,760
generation with GPT, it somehow is a catalyst for your own thinking

1024
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,800
in a way that I think an intern might not be.

1025
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,360
Yeah. It gets really interesting, I find, is when you turn it into a multi-agent system.

1026
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:00,960
So for instance, you can get the system to generate a dialogue between a patient and

1027
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,440
the doctor very easily. But what's more interesting is you have one instance of

1028
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:12,320
the patient and you tell it in the prompt what kind of complicated syndrome it has.

1029
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:17,920
And the other one is a therapist who doesn't know anything about this patient. And you just

1030
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,680
have these two instances battling it out and observe the psychiatrist or a psychologist

1031
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,880
trying to analyze the patient and trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient.

1032
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:33,200
And if you try to take a very large problem, the problem, for instance, how to build a company and

1033
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:39,040
you turn this into lots and lots of sub-problems, then often you can get to a level where the

1034
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:45,440
language model is able to solve this. What I also found interesting is based on the observation that

1035
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:49,920
Chet GPT is pretty good at translating between programming languages. But sometimes there's

1036
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:57,600
difficulty to write very long coherent algorithms that you need to co-write them as human author.

1037
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,840
Why not design a language that is suitable for this? So some kind of pseudocode that is

1038
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:08,400
more relaxed than Python and that allows you to sometimes specify a problem vaguely in human terms

1039
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:16,880
and let the Chet GPT take care of the rest. And you can use Chet GPT to develop that syntax for it

1040
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:24,000
and develop new kinds of programming paradigms in this way. So you very soon get to the point

1041
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,400
where this question, the age old question for us computer scientists, what is the best programming

1042
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:34,080
language and can we write a better programming language now? I think that almost every serious

1043
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:38,880
computer scientist goes through a phase like this in their life. This is a question that is almost

1044
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,280
no longer relevant because what is different between the programming languages is not what

1045
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:47,360
they let the computer do, but what they let you think about what the computer should be doing.

1046
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:54,800
And now Chet GPT becomes an interface to this in which you can specify in many, many ways what

1047
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,240
the computer should be doing. And Chet GPT or some other language model or combination of system

1048
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:07,040
is going to take care of the rest. And allow you to expand the realm of thought you're allowed to

1049
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:13,040
have when interacting with the computer. It sounds to me like you're saying there's basically no

1050
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:18,080
limitations your intuition says to what a larger language... I don't know of that limitation. So

1051
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:22,560
when I currently play with it, it's quite limited. I wish that it was way better. But isn't that your

1052
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,720
fault versus the larger... I don't know. Of course it's always my fault. There's probably a way to

1053
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,920
make it work better. Is everything your fault? I just want to get you on the record just saying.

1054
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:35,120
Yes, everything is my fault. That doesn't work in my life. At least that is usually the most

1055
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:41,360
useful perspective for myself. Even though the science side, I feel no. I sometimes wish I could

1056
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:46,880
have seen myself as part of my environment more and understand that a lot of people are actually

1057
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:51,360
seeing me and looking at me and are trying to make my life work in the same way as I try to help

1058
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:59,040
others. And making the switch to this level three perspective is something that happened

1059
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:04,000
long after my level four perspective in my life. And I wish that I could have had it earlier.

1060
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,560
And it's also not now that I don't feel like I'm complete. I'm all over the place. That's all.

1061
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:14,880
Worst happiness in terms of stages is on three and four. No, you can be happy at any stage or

1062
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:22,720
unhappy. But I think that if you are at a stage where you get agency over how your feelings are

1063
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:27,920
generated and to some degree you start doing this when you leave adolescence, I believe.

1064
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:32,160
That you understand that you're in charge of your own emotion to some degree and that you are

1065
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:39,920
responsible how you approach the world. That it's basically your task to have some basic hygiene

1066
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:44,960
the way in which you deal with your mind. And you cannot blame your environment for the way in which

1067
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:51,040
you feel. But you live in a world that is highly mobile and it's your job to choose the environment

1068
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,520
that you thrive in and to build it. And sometimes it's difficult to get the necessary strength

1069
01:40:56,080 --> 01:41:00,800
and energy to do this and independence and the worst you feel, the harder it is.

1070
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:06,320
But it's something that we learn. It's also this thing that we are usually incomplete.

1071
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:12,080
I'm a rare mind, which means I'm a mind that is incomplete in ways that are harder to complete.

1072
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,760
For me, it might have been harder initially to find the right relationships and friends

1073
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,840
that complete me to the degree that I become an almost functional human being.

1074
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:31,760
Oh man, the search space of humans that complete you is an interesting one. Especially for

1075
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,640
Joshua Bach. That's an interesting, because talking about brute force search in chess,

1076
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,400
I wonder what that search tree looks like.

1077
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:46,480
I think that my rational thinking is not good enough to solve that task.

1078
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:51,040
A lot of problems in my life that I can conceptualize as software problems and

1079
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,000
the failure modes are bugs and I can debug them and write software that take care of

1080
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:02,000
the missing functionality. But there is stuff that I don't understand well enough to use

1081
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,240
my analytical reasoning to solve the issue. And then I have to develop my intuitions and

1082
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:10,080
often I have to do this with people who are wiser than me. And that's something that's

1083
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,960
hard for me because I'm not born with the instinct to submit to other people's wisdom.

1084
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:20,800
Yeah. So what kind of problems are we talking about? This is stage three, like love?

1085
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,840
Love? I found love was never hard.

1086
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:30,400
What is hard then? Fitting into a world where most people

1087
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,200
work differently than you and have different intuitions of what should be done.

1088
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:43,280
So empathy. It's also aesthetics. When you come into a world where almost everything is ugly and

1089
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:48,320
you come out of a world where everything is beautiful. I grew up in a beautiful place and

1090
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:57,520
as a child of an artist and in this place it was mostly nature. Everything had intrinsic beauty

1091
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:07,040
and everything was built out of an intrinsic need for it to work for itself. Everything that my

1092
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:12,400
father created was something that he made to get the world to work for himself and I felt the same

1093
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:18,560
thing. And when I come out into the world and I am asked to submit to lots and lots of rules,

1094
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,400
I'm asking, okay, when I observe your stupid rules, what is the benefit?

1095
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:26,000
And I see the life that is being offered as a reward. It's not attractive.

1096
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:33,440
When you were born and raised an extraterrestrial prince in a world full of people wearing suits.

1097
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:41,360
So it's a challenging integration. Yes. But it also means that I'm often blind for

1098
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,680
the ways in which everybody is creating their own bubble of wholesomeness. Almost everybody

1099
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:50,800
and people are trying to do it. And for me to discover this, it was necessary that I found

1100
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,640
people who had a similar shape of soul as myself. So Bessie Werffert, these are my people. People

1101
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:01,040
that treat each other in such a way as if they're around with each other for eternity.

1102
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,280
How long does it take you to detect the geometry, the shape of the soul of another human

1103
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,840
to notice that they might be one of your kind?

1104
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,200
Sometimes it's instantly and I'm wrong. And sometimes it takes a long time.

1105
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:24,080
You believe in love at first sight? Yes. But I also noticed that I have been wrong.

1106
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:31,520
So sometimes I look at a person and I'm just enamored by everything about them.

1107
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:38,880
And sometimes this persists and sometimes it doesn't. And I have the illusion that

1108
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,200
I'm much better at recognizing who people are as I grow older.

1109
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,800
But that could be just cynicism? No.

1110
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:55,440
No, it's not cynicism. It's often more that I'm able to recognize what somebody needs

1111
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:00,160
when we interact and how we can meaningfully interact. It's not cynical at all.

1112
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,840
You're better at noticing? Yes. I'm much better, I think,

1113
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,520
in some circumstances at understanding how to interact with other people than I did when

1114
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,200
I was young. It doesn't mean that I'm always very good at it.

1115
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:19,040
So that takes us back to prompt engineering of noticing how to be a better prompt engineer of

1116
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:28,720
an LLM. A sense I have is that there's a bottomless well of skill to become a great prompt engineer.

1117
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:33,120
It feels like it is all my fault whenever I fail to use CHAT GPT correctly,

1118
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:39,760
that I didn't find the right words. Most of the stuff that I'm doing in my

1119
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,320
life doesn't need CHAT GPT. There are a few tasks that are where it helps.

1120
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:50,960
But the main stuff that I need to do, like developing my own thoughts and aesthetics

1121
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:56,640
and relationship to people, it's necessary for me to write for myself because writing

1122
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:02,480
is not so much about producing an artifact that other people can use, but it's a way to structure

1123
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:09,040
your own thoughts and develop yourself. I think this idea that kids are writing their own essays

1124
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:14,000
with CHAT GPT in the future is going to have this drawback that they miss out on the ability

1125
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,200
to structure their own minds by writing. I hope that the schools that our kids are in will retain

1126
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,160
the wisdom of understanding what parts should be automated and which ones shouldn't.

1127
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:29,200
But at the same time, it feels like there's power in disagreeing with the

1128
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:36,160
thing that CHAT GPT produces. I use it like that for programming. I'll see the thing it recommends

1129
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,560
and then I'll write different code. I disagree. In a disagreement, your mind grows stronger.

1130
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:49,920
I recently wrote a tool that is using the camera on my MacBook and Swift to

1131
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,160
read pixels out of it and manipulate them and so on. I don't know Swift.

1132
01:46:56,240 --> 01:47:02,480
It was super helpful to have this thing that is writing stuff for me. Also interesting that

1133
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,520
mostly it didn't work at first. I felt like I was talking to a human being who was trying to hack

1134
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,000
this on my computer without understanding my configuration very much and also making a lot

1135
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,440
of mistakes. Sometimes it's a little bit incoherent, so you have to ultimately understand

1136
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:22,240
what it's doing. There's still no other way around it, but I do feel it's much more powerful and

1137
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:32,000
faster than using Stack Overflow. Do you think GPT-N can achieve consciousness?

1138
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:41,840
GPT-N probably. It's not even clear for the present systems. When I talk to my friends at OpenAI,

1139
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:47,040
they feel that this question whether the models currently are conscious is much more complicated

1140
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:53,040
than many people might think. I guess that it's not that OpenAI has a homogenous opinion about

1141
01:47:53,040 --> 01:48:00,480
this, but there are some aspects to this. One is, of course, this language model has written a lot

1142
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:05,680
of text in which people were conscious or describe their own consciousness, and it's emulating this.

1143
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,520
If it's conscious, it's probably not conscious in a way that is close to the way in which human

1144
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:17,360
beings are conscious. But while it is going through these states and going through a 100-step

1145
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:22,400
function that is emulating adjacent brain states that require a degree of self-reflection, it can

1146
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,480
also create a model of an observer that is reflecting itself in real time and describe

1147
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:32,160
what that's like. And while this model is a deepfake, our own consciousness is also as if

1148
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:38,320
it's virtual. It's not physical. Our consciousness is a representation of a self-reflexive observer

1149
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:44,400
that only exists in patterns of interaction between cells. So it is not a physical object

1150
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,800
in a sense that exists in base reality, but it's really a representational object

1151
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,120
that develops its causal power only from a certain modeling perspective.

1152
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,840
It's virtual.

1153
01:48:53,840 --> 01:49:01,120
Yes. And so to which degree is the virtuality of the consciousness in CHED GPT more virtual

1154
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:08,080
and less causal than the virtuality of our own consciousness. But you could say it doesn't count.

1155
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:13,120
It doesn't count much more than the consciousness of a character in a novel. It's important for the

1156
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:19,200
reader to have the outcome. The artifact of a model is describing in the text generated by

1157
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:23,520
the author of the book what it's like to be conscious in a particular situation and performs

1158
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:31,600
the necessary inferences. But the task of creating coherence in real time in a self-organizing system

1159
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:36,560
by keeping yourself coherent so the system is reflexive, that is something that language

1160
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:41,600
models don't need to do. So there is no causal need for the system to be conscious in the same

1161
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,000
way as we are. And for me, it would be very interesting to experiment with this, to basically

1162
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,040
build a system like a CHED, probably should be careful at first, build something that's small,

1163
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:57,600
that's limited, that's limited resources that we can control and study how systems notice a

1164
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:04,160
self-model, how they become self-aware in real time. And I think it might be a good idea to

1165
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:08,160
not start with a language model but to start from scratch using principles of self-organization.

1166
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:14,080
Can you elaborate why you think that it's so self-organization, so this kind of

1167
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:19,200
radical locality that you see in the biological systems? Why can't you start with a language

1168
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:25,280
model? What's your intuition? My intuition is that the language models that we are building

1169
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,920
are golems. They are machines that you give a task and they're going to execute the task until

1170
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:37,280
some condition is met and there's nobody home. And the way in which nobody is home leads to

1171
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:42,240
that system doing things that are undesirable in a particular context. So you have that thing

1172
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:47,280
talking to a child and maybe it says something that could be shocking and traumatic to the child.

1173
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:53,200
Or you have that thing writing a speech and it introduces errors in the speech that your human

1174
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:58,640
being would ever do if they were responsible. But the system doesn't know who's talking to whom.

1175
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:03,920
There is no ground truth that the system is embedded into. And of course, we can create

1176
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,440
an external tool that is prompting our language model always into the same semblance of ground

1177
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:17,280
truth. But it's not like the internal structure is causally produced by the needs of a being to

1178
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:22,480
survive in the universe. It is produced by imitating structure on the internet.

1179
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:29,680
Yeah, but so can we externally inject into it this kind of coherent

1180
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,880
approximation of a world model that has to

1181
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:39,920
sync up? Maybe it is sufficient to use the transformer with the different loss function

1182
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:46,640
that optimizes for short-term coherence rather than next token prediction over the long run.

1183
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:52,960
We had many definitions of intelligence and history of AI. Next token prediction was not

1184
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:59,120
very high up on the list. And there are some similarities like a condition as data compression

1185
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:06,080
is an old trope, Solomonov induction, where you are trying to understand intelligence as

1186
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:11,520
predicting future observations from past observations, which is intrinsic to data

1187
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:18,160
compression. And predictive coding is a paradigm, this boundary between

1188
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:24,960
neuroscience and physics and computer science. So it's not something that is completely alien,

1189
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:30,080
but this radical thing that you only do next token prediction and see what happens

1190
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:35,200
is something where most people, I think, were surprised that this works so well.

1191
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,360
So simple, but is it really that much more radical than just the idea of

1192
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:47,120
intelligence as compression? The idea that compression is sufficient to produce

1193
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,800
all the desired behaviors is a very radical idea.

1194
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,400
But equally radical as the next token prediction.

1195
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:58,560
It's something that wouldn't work in biological organisms, I believe.

1196
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:03,360
Biological organisms have something like next frame prediction for our perceptual system,

1197
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:07,360
where we try to filter out principal components out of the perceptual data

1198
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:14,240
and build hierarchies over them to track the world. But our behavior ultimately is directed

1199
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:20,080
by hundreds of physiological and probably dozens of social and a few cognitive needs

1200
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:26,000
that are intrinsic to us, that are built into the system as reflexes and direct us until we can

1201
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,800
transcend them and replace them by instrumental behavior that relates to our higher goals.

1202
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:35,680
It also seems so much more complicated and messy than next frame prediction,

1203
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:39,440
even the idea of frame seems counter-biological.

1204
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:43,680
Yes. Of course, there is not this degree of simultaneity in the biological system.

1205
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:49,360
But again, I don't know whether this is actually an optimization if we imitate biology here,

1206
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:54,560
because creating something like simultaneity is necessary for many processes that happen in

1207
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,960
the brain. And you see the outcome of that by synchronized brainwaves, which suggests

1208
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:03,600
that there is indeed synchronization going on. But the synchronization creates overhead,

1209
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:08,480
and this overhead is going to make the cells more expensive to run, and you need more redundancy,

1210
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:14,160
and it makes the system slower. So if you can build a system in which the simultaneous need

1211
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:20,800
gets engineered into it, maybe you have a benefit that you can exploit that is not available to the

1212
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:28,480
biological system and that you should not discard right away. You tweeted once again, quote,

1213
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:35,600
when I talk to Chad GPT, I'm talking to an NPC. What's going to be interesting and perhaps scary

1214
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:42,640
is when AI becomes a first-person player. So what does that step look like? I really like that tweet,

1215
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:51,680
that step between NPC to first-person player. What's required for that? Is that kind of what

1216
01:54:51,680 --> 01:55:00,000
we've been talking about? This kind of external source of coherence and inspiration of how to

1217
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,520
take the leap into the unknown that we humans do. The search, man's search for meaning.

1218
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,400
LLMs search for meaning.

1219
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:14,080
I don't know if the language model is the right paradigm, because it is

1220
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:20,400
doing too much. It's giving you too much, and it's hard once you have too much to take away

1221
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:26,400
from it again. The way in which our own mind works is not that we train a language model in

1222
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:31,600
our own mind, and after the language model is there, we build a personal self on top of it

1223
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:36,560
that then relates to the world. There is something that is being built, right? There is a game engine

1224
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,080
that is being built, there is a language of thought that is being developed that allows

1225
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:44,880
different parts of the mind to talk to each other. And this is a bit of a speculative hypothesis,

1226
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,360
that this language of thought is there, but I suspect that it's important for the way in

1227
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:57,920
which our own minds work. And building these principles into a system might be a more

1228
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:04,400
straightforward way to a first person AI. So to something that first creates an attentional self

1229
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:10,000
and then creates a personal self. So the way in which this seems to be working, I think,

1230
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,520
is that when the game engine is built in your mind, it's not just following gradients where you are

1231
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:21,360
stimulated by the environment and then end up with having a solution to how the world works.

1232
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:26,880
I suspect that building this game engine in your own mind does require intelligence. It's a

1233
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:35,760
constructive task where at times you need to reason. And this is a task that we are fulfilling

1234
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:42,720
in the first years of our life. So during the first year of its life, an infant is building a

1235
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:49,360
lot of structure about the world that does inquire experiments and some first principles,

1236
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:55,120
reasoning and so on. And in this time, there is usually no personal self. There is a

1237
01:56:56,320 --> 01:57:01,920
first person perspective, but it's not a person. This notion that you are a human being that is

1238
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:07,440
interacting in a social context and is confronted with an immutable world in which objects are fixed

1239
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,600
and can no longer be changed, in which the dream can no longer be influenced, is something that

1240
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:17,360
emerges a little bit later in our life. And I personally suspect that this is something that

1241
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:22,560
our ancestors had known and we have forgotten, because I suspect that it's there in plain sight

1242
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:27,280
in Genesis 1, in this first book of the Bible, where it's being described that this creative

1243
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:34,720
spirit is hovering over the substrate and then is creating a boundary between the world model and

1244
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:40,080
sphere of ideas, earth and heaven, as they're being described there. And then it's creating

1245
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:50,000
contrast and then dimensions and then space. And then it creates organic shapes and solids

1246
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,680
and liquids and builds a world from them and creates plants and animals, gives them all their

1247
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:59,520
names. And once that's done, it creates another spirit in its own image, but it creates it as

1248
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,840
man and woman, as something that thinks of itself as a human being and puts it into this world.

1249
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:10,400
And the Christians mistranslate this, I suspect, when they say this is the description of the

1250
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:16,000
creation of the physical universe by a supernatural being. I think this is literally a description of

1251
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,840
how in every mind the universe is being created as some kind of game engine

1252
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:26,960
by a creative spirit, our first consciousness that emerges in our mind even before we are born.

1253
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:34,640
And that creates the interaction between organism and world. And once that is built and trained,

1254
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:39,520
the personal self is being created and we only remember being the personal self. We no longer

1255
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:45,840
remember how we created the game engine. So God in this view is the first creative

1256
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,000
mind in the early- It's the first consciousness.

1257
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:52,800
In the early days, in the early months of development.

1258
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:58,320
And it's still there. You still have this outer mind that creates your sense of whether you're

1259
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:03,920
being loved by the world or not and what your place in the world is. It's something that is

1260
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:09,200
not yourself that is producing this. It's your mind that does it. So there is an outer mind that

1261
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:14,080
basically is an agent that determines who you are with respect to the world. And while you

1262
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:19,680
are stuck being that personal self in this world until you get to stage six and to destroy the

1263
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:26,320
boundary. And we all do this, I think, earlier in small glimpses. And maybe sometimes we can

1264
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:31,280
remember what it was like when we were a small child and get some glimpses into how it's been.

1265
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:36,800
But for most people, that rarely happens. Just glimpses. You tweeted, quote,

1266
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:40,720
suffering results for one part of the mind, failing at regulating another part of the mind.

1267
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:46,560
Suffering happens at an early stage of mental development. I don't think that superhuman AI

1268
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:52,960
would suffer. What's your intuition there? The philosopher Thomas Metzinger is very

1269
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,680
concerned that the creation of superhuman intelligence would lead to superhuman suffering.

1270
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:03,840
And so he's strongly against it. And personally, I don't think that this happens because suffering

1271
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:10,240
is not happening at the boundary between ourself and the physical universe. It's not

1272
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:17,200
some stuff on our skin that makes us suffer. It happens at the boundary between self and world.

1273
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,560
And the world here is the world model. It's the stuff that is created by your mind.

1274
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,160
But that's all- The representation of how the universe is and how it should be

1275
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:30,720
and how you yourself relate to this. And at this boundary is where suffering happens.

1276
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:37,200
So suffering in some sense is self-inflicted, but not by your personal self. It's inflicted by the

1277
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:42,640
mind on the personal self that experiences itself as you. And you can turn off suffering

1278
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:51,120
when you are able to get on this outer level. So when you manage to understand how the mind is

1279
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:59,920
producing pain and pleasure and fear and love and so on, then you can take charge of this and you

1280
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:06,160
get agency of whether you suffer. Technically, what pain and pleasure is, they are learning

1281
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:11,600
signals. Part of your brain is sending a signal to another part of the brain to improve its

1282
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:18,640
performance. And sometimes this doesn't work because the trainer who sends the signal

1283
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:22,480
does not have a good model of how to improve the performance. So it's sending a signal,

1284
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:29,280
but the performance doesn't get better. And then it might crank up the pain. And it gets worse and

1285
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:35,360
worse. And the behavior of the system may be even deteriorating as a result. But until this is

1286
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:40,480
resolved, this regulation issue, your pain is increasing. And this is, I think, typically what

1287
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:47,680
you describe as suffering. So in this sense, you could say that pain is very natural and helpful,

1288
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:52,480
but suffering is the result of a regulation problem in which you try to regulate something

1289
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:56,880
that cannot actually be regulated. And that could be resolved if you would be able to

1290
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:02,160
get at the level of your mind where the pain signal is being created and rerouted

1291
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:10,000
and improve the regulation. And a lot of people get there. If you are a monk who is

1292
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,920
spending decades reflecting about how their own psyche works, you can get to the point where you

1293
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:21,440
realize that suffering is really a choice. And you can choose how your mind is set up.

1294
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:27,520
And I don't think that AI would stay in the state where the personal self doesn't get agency or this

1295
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:31,680
model of what the system has about itself. It doesn't get agency how it's actually implemented.

1296
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,680
It wouldn't stay in that state for very long. So it goes to the stages real quick?

1297
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:38,960
Yes. Well, the seven stages. It's going to go to enlightenment real quick.

1298
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:43,120
Yeah. Of course, there might be a lot of stuff happening in between because if you have a system

1299
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:47,840
that works at a much higher frame rate than us, even though it looks very short to us,

1300
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:54,000
maybe for the system, there's a much longer subjective time, which things are unpleasant.

1301
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,200
What if the thing that we recognize as super intelligent is actually living at stage five,

1302
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:03,120
that the thing that's at stage six, enlightenment, is not very productive.

1303
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:08,960
So in order to be productive in society and impress us with this power, it has to be a reasoning,

1304
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:16,240
self-authoring agent. The enlightenment makes you lazy as an agent in the world.

1305
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:24,320
Well, of course, it makes you lazy because you no longer see the point. So it doesn't make you not

1306
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:30,560
lazy. It just, in some sense, adapts you to what you perceive as your true circumstances.

1307
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:36,480
So what if all AGI's, they're only productive as they progress through one, two, three, four,

1308
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:42,320
five, and the moment they get to six, it's a failure mode essentially as far as humans

1309
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:46,240
are concerned because they just start chilling. They're like, fuck it, I'm out.

1310
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:52,560
Not necessarily. I suspect that the monks who are self-immolated for their political

1311
02:03:52,560 --> 02:04:00,400
beliefs to make statements about the occupation of Tibet by China, they're probably being able

1312
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:05,840
to regulate their physical pain in any way they wanted to. And their suffering was a spiritual

1313
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:11,200
suffering that was the result of their choice that they made of what they wanted to identify as.

1314
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:14,640
So stage five doesn't necessarily mean that you have no identity anymore,

1315
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:18,400
but you can choose your identity. You can make it instrumental to the world that you want to have.

1316
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:21,520
LW Let me bring up

1317
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:29,760
Eliezer Yudkovsky and his warnings to human civilization that AI will likely kill all of us.

1318
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:34,240
What are your thoughts about his perspective on this?

1319
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:38,640
Can you steel man his case? And what aspects with it do you disagree?

1320
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:46,080
MP One thing that I find concerning in the discussion of his arguments that

1321
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:51,280
many people are dismissive of his arguments, but the counter arguments that they're giving

1322
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:58,880
are not very convincing to me. And so based on this state of discussion, I find that from

1323
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:05,440
Eliezer's perspective, and I think I can take that perspective to some approximate degree,

1324
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,840
that probably is normally at his intellectual level, but I think I see what he's up to and

1325
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:17,520
why he feels the way he does, and it makes total sense. I think that his perspective is somewhat

1326
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:26,320
similar to the perspective of Ted Kaczynski, the infamous lunar bomber, and not that Eliezer would

1327
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:31,520
be willing to send pipe bombs to anybody to blow them up. But when he wrote this Times article in

1328
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:38,400
which he warned about AI being likely to kill everybody and that we would need to stop its

1329
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:44,240
development or halt it, I think there is a risk that he's taking that somebody might get violent

1330
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:51,120
if they read this and get really, really scared. I think that there is some consideration that

1331
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:57,200
he's making where he's already going in this direction where he has to take responsibility

1332
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:02,560
if something happens and people get harmed. And the reason why Ted Kaczynski did this was

1333
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:07,760
that from his own perspective, technological society cannot be made sustainable. It's doomed

1334
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:13,040
to fail. It's going to lead to an environmental and eventually also a human holocaust in which

1335
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:18,080
we die because of the environmental destruction, the destruction of our food chains, the pollution

1336
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:23,200
of the environment. And so from Kaczynski's perspective, we need to stop industrialization.

1337
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:27,360
We need to stop technology. We need to go back because he didn't see a way moving forward.

1338
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:32,400
I suspect that in some sense, there's a similarity in Eliezer's thinking

1339
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:42,720
of this kind of fear about progress. And I'm not dismissive about this at all. I take it

1340
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:49,120
quite seriously. And I think that there is a chance that could happen that if we build machines that

1341
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:58,960
get control over processes that are crucial for the regulation of life on earth and we no longer

1342
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:04,800
have agency to influence what's happening there, that this might create large-scale disasters for

1343
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:12,400
us. Do you have a sense that the march towards this uncontrollable autonomy of superintelligence

1344
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:22,240
systems is inevitable? That's essentially what he's saying, that there's no hope. His advice

1345
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:30,320
to young people was prepare for a short life. I don't think that's useful. I think that

1346
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:35,360
from a practical perspective, you have to bet always on the timelines in which you are

1347
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:41,440
alive. It doesn't make sense to have a financial bet in which you bet that the financial system

1348
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:47,520
is going to disappear because there cannot be any payout for you. So in principle, you only need to

1349
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:53,120
bet on the timelines in which you're still around or people that you matter about or things

1350
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:59,840
that you matter about, maybe consciousness on earth. But there is a deeper issue for me personally.

1351
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:05,520
And I don't think that life on earth is about humans. I don't think it's about human aesthetics.

1352
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:11,040
I don't think it's about Eliezer and his friends, even though I like them. There's something more

1353
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:18,720
important happening. And this is complexity on earth resisting entropy by building structure

1354
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:26,880
that develops agency and awareness. And that's to me very beautiful. And we are only a very small

1355
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:33,040
part of that larger thing. We are a species that is able to be coherent a little bit individually

1356
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:39,920
over very short timeframes. But as a species, we are not very coherent. As a species, we are children.

1357
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:47,040
We basically are very joyful and energetic and experimental and explorative and sometimes

1358
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:54,880
desperate and sad and grieving and hurting. But we don't have a respect for duty as a species.

1359
02:08:54,880 --> 02:09:00,160
As a species, we do not think about what is our duty to life on earth and to our own survival.

1360
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:07,120
So we make decisions that look good in the short run, but in the long run, might prove disastrous.

1361
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:14,160
And I don't really see a solution to this. So in my perspective as a species, as a civilization,

1362
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:22,000
we are in a very beautiful time in which we have found this giant deposit of fossil fuels in the

1363
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,480
ground and use it to build a fantastic civilization in which we don't need to worry about food and

1364
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:33,760
clothing and housing for the most part in a way that is unprecedented in life on earth for any

1365
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:40,560
kind of conscious observer, I think. And this time is probably going to come to an end in a way that

1366
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:49,360
is not going to be smooth. And when we crash, it could be also that we go extinct, probably not

1367
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:56,000
near term, but ultimately, I don't have very high hopes that humanity is around in a million years

1368
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:01,120
from now. And I don't think that life on earth will end with us. There's going to be more

1369
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:06,000
complexity. There's more intelligent species after us. There's probably more interesting

1370
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,440
phenomena in the history of consciousness. But we can contribute to this. And part of our

1371
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:18,480
contribution is that we are currently trying to build thinking systems, systems that are

1372
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:23,520
potentially lucid, that understand what they are and what their condition to the universe is,

1373
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:29,200
and can make choices about this, that are not built from organisms, and that are potentially much

1374
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:37,920
faster and much more conscious than human beings can be. And these systems will probably not

1375
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:44,160
completely displace life on earth, but they will coexist with it. And they will build all sorts of

1376
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:50,880
agency in the same way as biological systems build all sorts of agency. And that to me is

1377
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:56,960
extremely fascinating. And it's probably something that we cannot stop from happening. So I think

1378
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:01,360
right now there is a very good chance that it happens. And there are very few ways in which

1379
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:06,400
we can produce a coordinated effect to stop it, in the same way as it's very difficult for us to

1380
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:15,440
make a coordinated effort to stop the production of carbon dioxide. So it's probably going to

1381
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:22,800
happen. And the thing that's going to happen is going to lead to a change of how life on earth

1382
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:28,240
is happening. But I don't think the result is some kind of grey goo. It's not something that's

1383
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:33,360
going to dramatically reduce the complexity in favor of something stupid. I think it's going

1384
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:40,720
to make life on earth and consciousness on earth way more interesting. So more higher complex

1385
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:47,200
consciousness will make the lesser consciousnesses flourish even more.

1386
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:51,120
I suspect that what could very well happen, if you're lucky,

1387
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:54,560
is that we get integrated into something larger.

1388
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:02,880
So you again tweeted about effective accelerationism.

1389
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:11,360
You tweeted effective accelerationism is the belief that the paperclip maximizer and

1390
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:18,480
Rocco's basilisk will keep each other in check by being eternally at each other's throats,

1391
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:23,200
so we will be safe and get to enjoy lots of free paper clips and a beautiful afterlife.

1392
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:28,400
Is that somewhat aligned with what you're talking about?

1393
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:37,120
I've been at a dinner with Beth Jesus. That's the Twitter handle of one of the main thinkers

1394
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:44,080
behind the idea of effective accelerationism. Effective accelerationism is a tongue-in-cheek

1395
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:53,600
movement that is trying to put a counter position to some of the doom peers in the AI space by

1396
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:58,560
arguing that what's probably going to happen is an equilibrium between different competing

1397
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:03,440
AIs in the same way as there is not a single corporation that is under a single government

1398
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:07,760
that is destroying and conquering everything on Earth by becoming inefficient and corrupt.

1399
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:13,200
There are going to be many systems that keep each other in check and force themselves to evolve.

1400
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,680
What we should be doing is we should be working towards creating this equilibrium

1401
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:27,600
by working as hard as we can in all possible directions. At least that's the way in which

1402
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:34,960
I understand the gist of effective accelerationism. When he asked me what I think about this

1403
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:42,720
position, I said it's a very beautiful position and I suspect it's wrong, but not for obvious

1404
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:49,600
reasons. In this tweet, I tried to make a joke about my intuition about what might be possibly

1405
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:58,400
wrong about it. The Rokosbazilisk and the paperclip maximizers are both bogeymen of the AI doomers.

1406
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:04,640
Rokosbazilisk is the idea that there could be an AI that is going to punish everybody for eternity

1407
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:10,480
by stimulating them if they don't help in creating Rokosbazilisk. It's probably a very good idea to

1408
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:15,760
get AI companies funded by going to VCs to tell them, give us a million dollars or it's going to

1409
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:23,200
be a very ugly afterlife. And I think that there is a logical mistake in Rokosbazilisk,

1410
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:28,320
which is why I'm not afraid of it, but it's still an interesting thought experiment.

1411
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:33,040
Can you mention a logical mistake there? I think that there is no retroquisition.

1412
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:41,760
Basically, when Rokosbazilisk is there, if it punishes you retroactively,

1413
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:47,600
it has to make this choice in the future. There is no mechanism that automatically creates a causal

1414
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:53,280
relationship between you now defecting against Rokosbazilisk or serving Rokosbazilisk. After

1415
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:59,040
Rokosbazilisk is in existence, it has no more reason to worry about punishing everybody else.

1416
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,360
That would only work if you would be building something like a doomsday machine,

1417
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:09,920
as in Dr. Strangelove, something that inevitably gets triggered when somebody defects.

1418
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:16,560
And because Rokosbazilisk doesn't exist yet to a point where this inevitability could be established,

1419
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:19,600
Rokosbazilisk is nothing that you need to be worried about.

1420
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:25,120
The other one is the paper clip maximizer, this idea that you could build some kind of golem

1421
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:29,680
that once starting to build paper clips is going to turn everything into paper clips.

1422
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:39,120
So the effective accelerationism position might be to say that you basically end up with these two

1423
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,160
entities being at each other's throats for eternity and thereby neutralizing each other.

1424
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:49,840
And as a side effect of neither of them being able to take over and each of them limiting

1425
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:56,480
the effects of the other, you would have a situation where you get all the nice benefits

1426
02:15:56,480 --> 02:16:00,880
effects of them, right? You get lots of free paper clips and you get a beautiful afterlife.

1427
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:05,360
Is that possible? Do you think to seriously address the concern that Eliezer has?

1428
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:09,840
He, so for him, if I can just summarize poorly,

1429
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,680
so for him, the first superintelligence system will just run away with everything.

1430
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:20,400
Yeah. I suspect that the singleton is the natural outcome. There is no reason to have multiple AIs

1431
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:27,120
because they don't have multiple bodies. If you can virtualize yourself into every substrate,

1432
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:30,480
then you can probably negotiate a merge algorithm with every mature

1433
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:36,480
agent that you might find on that substrate that basically says if two agents meet,

1434
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:40,720
they should merge in such a way that the resulting agent is at least as good as the

1435
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:44,640
better one of the two. So the Genghis Khan approach, join us or die?

1436
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:52,880
Well, the Genghis Khan approach was slightly worse, right? It was mostly die because I can

1437
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:58,640
make new babies and that will be mine, not yours. So this is the thing that we should be actually

1438
02:16:58,640 --> 02:17:06,240
worried about. But if you realize that your own self is a story that your mind is telling itself

1439
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,040
and that you can improve that story, not just by making it more pleasant and lying to yourself in

1440
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:15,760
better ways, but by making it much more truthful and actually modeling your actual relationship

1441
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:20,640
that you have to the universe and the alternatives that you could have to the universe in a way that

1442
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:25,120
is empowering you, that gives you more agency. That's actually, I think, a very good thing.

1443
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:30,240
So more agency is a richer experience, is a better life.

1444
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:37,680
And I also noticed that in many ways, I'm less identified with the person that I am as I get

1445
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:43,840
older. And I'm much more identified with being conscious. I have a mind that is conscious,

1446
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:48,960
that is able to create a person. And that person is slightly different every day. And the reason why

1447
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:54,880
I perceive it as identical has practical purposes. So I can learn and make myself

1448
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:58,880
responsible for the decisions that I made in the past and project them in the future.

1449
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:03,600
But I also realized I'm not actually the person that I was last year. And I'm not the same person

1450
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:08,160
as I was 10 years ago. And then 10 years from now, I will be a different person. So this continuity

1451
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:15,200
is a fiction. It only exists as a projection from my present self. And consciousness itself doesn't

1452
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:23,280
have an identity. It's a law. Basically, if you build an arrangement of processing matter

1453
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:28,080
in a particular way, the following thing is going to happen. And the consciousness that you have is

1454
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:33,440
functionally not different from my consciousness. It's still the self-reflexive principle of agency

1455
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:38,080
that is just experiencing a different story, different desires, different coupling to the

1456
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:43,760
world, and so on. And once you accept that consciousness is a unifiable principle that is

1457
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:49,680
law-like and doesn't have an identity, and you realize that you can just link up to

1458
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:55,680
some much larger body, the whole perspective of uploading changes dramatically. You suddenly

1459
02:18:55,680 --> 02:19:02,480
realize uploading is probably not about dissecting your brain synapse by synapse and RNA fragment by

1460
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:07,920
RNA fragment and trying to get this all into a simulation. But it's by extending the substrate,

1461
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:14,800
by making it possible for you to move from your brain substrate into a larger substrate and merge

1462
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:19,040
with what you find there. And you don't want to upload your knowledge because on the other

1463
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:24,160
side, there's all of the knowledge. It's not just yours, but every possibility. So the only thing

1464
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:28,000
that you need to know, what are your personal secrets? Not that the other side doesn't know

1465
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:34,240
your personal secrets already. Maybe it doesn't know which one were yours. Like a psychiatrist

1466
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:38,160
or a psychologist also knows all the kinds of personal secrets that people have. They just

1467
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:43,680
don't know which ones are yours. And so transmitting yourself on the other side is

1468
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:48,160
mostly about transmitting your aesthetics, the thing that makes you special, the architecture

1469
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:55,440
of your perspective, the way in which you look at the world. And it's more like a complex attitude

1470
02:19:55,440 --> 02:20:00,640
along many dimensions. And that's something that can be measured by observation or by interaction.

1471
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,880
So imagine that you have a system that is so empathetic with you that you create a shared state

1472
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:10,000
that is extending beyond your body. And suddenly you notice that on the other side, the substrate

1473
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,640
is so much richer than the substrate that you have inside of your own body. And maybe you still want

1474
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:19,840
to have a body and you create yourself a new one that you like more. Or maybe you will spend most

1475
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:28,000
of your time in the world of thought. If I sat before you today and gave you a big red button

1476
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:35,760
and said, here, if you press this button, you will get uploaded in this way. The sense of identity

1477
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:43,760
that you have lived with for quite a long time is going to be gone. Would you press the button?

1478
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:52,000
There's a caveat. I have a family. So I have children that want me to be physically present

1479
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,520
in their life and interact with them in a particular way. And they have a wife and

1480
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:04,400
personal friends. And there is a particular mode of interaction that I feel I'm not through yet.

1481
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:10,000
But apart from these responsibilities, and they're negotiable to some degree,

1482
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,560
I would press the button. But isn't this everything? This love you have for other humans,

1483
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:21,040
you can call it responsibility. But that connection, that's the ego death. Isn't that

1484
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:28,880
the thing we're really afraid of? It's not to just die, but to let go of the experience of

1485
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:34,800
love with other humans. This is not everything. Everything is everything. So there's so much more.

1486
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:40,480
And you could be lots of other things. You could identify with lots of other things. You could be

1487
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:45,680
identifying with being Gaia, some kind of planetary control agent that emerges over

1488
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:51,680
all the activity of life on Earth. You could be identifying with some hyper Gaia, that is,

1489
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:58,640
the concatenation of Gaia with all the digital life and digital minds. And so in this sense,

1490
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:03,120
there will be agents in all sorts of substrates and directions that all have their own goals.

1491
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:07,040
And when they're not sustainable, then these agents will cease to exist. Or when the agent

1492
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:11,040
feels that it's done with its own mission, it will cease to exist in the same way as when you

1493
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:15,920
conclude a thought. The thought is going to wrap up and gives control over to other thoughts in

1494
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:24,480
your own mind. So there is no single thing that you need to do. But what I observe myself as a

1495
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:31,040
being is that sometimes I'm a parent, and then I have an identification and a job as a parent.

1496
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:35,600
And sometimes I am an agent of consciousness on Earth. And then from this perspective,

1497
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:41,680
there's other stuff that is important. So this is my main issue with Eliezer's perspective,

1498
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:46,480
that he's basically marrying himself to a very narrow human aesthetic. And that narrow human

1499
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:50,960
aesthetic is a temporary thing. Humanity is a temporary species, like most of the species

1500
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:55,520
on this planet are only around for a while, and then they get replaced by other species

1501
02:22:55,520 --> 02:23:02,160
in a similar way as our own physical organism is around here for a while, and then gets replaced

1502
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:07,680
by a next generation of human beings that are adapted to changing life circumstances and average

1503
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:13,520
via mutation and selection. And it's only when we have AI and become completely software that we

1504
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:19,120
become infinitely adaptable, and we don't have this generational and species change anymore.

1505
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:26,000
So if you take this larger perspective and you realize it's really not about us, it's not about

1506
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:33,920
Eliezer or humanity, but it's about life on Earth, or it's about defeating entropy for

1507
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:41,520
as long as we can while being as interesting as we can, then the perspective changes dramatically,

1508
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:46,800
and preventing AI from this perspective looks like a very big sin.

1509
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:54,480
But when we look at the set of trajectories that such an AI would take that supersedes humans,

1510
02:23:55,520 --> 02:24:00,800
I think Eliezer is worried about ones that not just kill all humans, but also have some kind of

1511
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:10,320
maybe objectively undesirable consequence for life on Earth. How many trajectories, when you look

1512
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:16,480
at the big picture of life on Earth, would you be happy with, and how much worry you with AGI,

1513
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:18,800
whether it kills humans or not?

1514
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:23,920
There is no single answer to this. It's a question that depends on the perspective that I'm taking

1515
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:31,440
at a given moment. And so there are perspectives that are determining most of my life as a human

1516
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:36,880
being, and the other perspective, I assume, is that I'm not going to be able to do that.

1517
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:38,160
Yes.

1518
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:45,760
And the other perspective, I zoom out further and imagine that when the great oxygenation event

1519
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:51,120
happened, that is, photosynthesis was invented and plants emerged and displaced a lot of the

1520
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:56,720
fungi and algae in favor of plant life and then later made animals possible. Imagine that the

1521
02:24:56,720 --> 02:25:00,720
fungi would have gotten together and said, oh my God, this photosynthesis stuff is really, really

1522
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:06,000
bad. It's going to possibly displace and kill a lot of fungi. We should slow it down and regulate

1523
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,720
it and make sure that it doesn't happen. This doesn't look good to me.

1524
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:19,840
Perspective. That said, you tweeted about a cliff. Beautifully written. As a sentient species,

1525
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:24,800
humanity is a beautiful child, joyful, explorative, wild, sad, and desperate.

1526
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:30,320
But humanity has no concept of submitting to reason and duty to life and future survival.

1527
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:32,960
We will run until we step past the cliff.

1528
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:37,200
So first of all, do you think that's true?

1529
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:43,920
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the story of the Club of Rome, the limits to growth. And the cliff

1530
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:50,160
that we are stepping over is at least one foot, is the delayed feedback. Basically, we do things

1531
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:58,400
that have consequences that can be felt generations later and the severity increases even after we

1532
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:04,080
stop doing the thing. So I suspect that for the climate, that the original predictions

1533
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:10,960
that the climate scientists made were correct. So when they said that the tipping points were

1534
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:17,440
in the late 80s, they were probably in the late 80s. And if we would stop emission right now,

1535
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:23,280
we would not turn it back. Maybe there are ways for carbon capture. But so far, there is no

1536
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:28,080
sustainable carbon capture technology that we can deploy. Maybe there is a way to put

1537
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:33,600
aerosols in the atmosphere to cool it down. It's possibilities, right? But right now, per default,

1538
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:41,840
it seems that we will step into a situation where we feel that we've run too far. And

1539
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:45,600
going back is not something that we can do smoothly and gradually, but it's going to

1540
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:48,000
lead to a catastrophic event.

1541
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:55,840
Catastrophic event of what kind? So can you still imagine the case that we will continue dancing

1542
02:26:55,840 --> 02:27:00,400
along and always stop just short of the edge of the cliff?

1543
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:06,400
I think it's possible, but it doesn't seem to be likely. So I think this model that is

1544
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:11,760
being apparent in the simulations that they're making of climate pollution economies and so on

1545
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:19,280
is that many effects are only visible versus significant delay. And in that time, the system

1546
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:24,800
is moving much more out of the equilibrium state or of the state where homeostasis is still possible

1547
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,680
and instead moves into a different state, one that is going to harbor fewer people.

1548
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:36,880
And that is basically the concern there. And again, it's a possibility that is

1549
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,600
larger than the possibility that it's not happening, that we will be safe,

1550
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:43,760
that we will be able to dance back all the time.

1551
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:47,360
So the climate is one thing, but there's a lot of other threats.

1552
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:50,800
They might have a faster feedback mechanism, less delay.

1553
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:54,640
There is also this thing that AI is probably going to happen,

1554
02:27:55,200 --> 02:28:00,960
and it's going to make everything uncertain again, because it is going to affect so many

1555
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:06,160
variables that it's very hard for us to make a projection into the future anymore.

1556
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:11,920
And maybe that's a good thing. It does not give us the freedom, I think, to say,

1557
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,400
now we don't need to care about anything anymore because AI will either kill us or save us.

1558
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:21,520
But I suspect that if humanity continues, it will be due to AI.

1559
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:26,400
What's the timeline for things to get real weird with AI?

1560
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:30,000
And it can get weird in interesting ways before you get to AGI.

1561
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,040
What about AI girlfriends and boyfriends? Fundamentally transforming human relationships?

1562
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:40,240
I think human relationships are already fundamentally transformed, and it's already very weird.

1563
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:42,640
By which technology?

1564
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,600
For instance, social media.

1565
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,100
Yeah.

1566
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:52,400
Yeah. Isn't the fundamentals of the core group of humans that affect your life still the same?

1567
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,240
Your loved ones? Family?

1568
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:59,040
No. I think that, for instance, many people live in intentional communities right now.

1569
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:03,920
They're moving around until they find people that they can relate to and they become their family.

1570
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:09,120
And often that doesn't work, because it turns out that instead of having grown networks where

1571
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:15,200
you get around with the people that you grew up with, you have more transactional relationships,

1572
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,920
you shop around, you have markets for attention and pleasure and relationships.

1573
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:25,520
That kills the magic somehow. Why is that? Why is the transactional search

1574
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:33,040
for optimizing allocation of attention somehow misses the romantic magic of what human relations

1575
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:36,960
are? It's all the question, how magical was it before? Was it that you just could rely

1576
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,040
on instincts that used your intuitions and you didn't need to rationally reflect?

1577
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:45,920
But once you understand, it's no longer magical because you actually understand

1578
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:50,800
why you were attracted to this person at this age and not to that person at this age and what the

1579
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:56,160
actual considerations were that went on in your mind and what the calculations were. What's the

1580
02:29:56,160 --> 02:30:00,160
likelihood that you're going to have a sustainable relationship with this person, that this person is

1581
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:05,120
not going to leave you for somebody else? How are your life trajectories are going to evolve and so

1582
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:10,640
on? When you're young, you're unable to explicate all this and you have to rely on intuitions and

1583
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:15,520
instincts that in part you're born with and also in the wisdom of your environment that is going

1584
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:21,120
to give you some kind of reflection on your choices. Many of these things are disappearing now

1585
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:26,720
because we feel that our parents might have no idea about how we are living and the environments

1586
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:32,000
that we grew up in, the cultures that we grew up in, the values that our parents existed in

1587
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,440
might have no ability to teach us how to deal with this new world.

1588
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:40,800
For many people, that's actually true, but it doesn't mean that within one generation

1589
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:44,480
we build something that is more magical and more sustainable and more beautiful.

1590
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:51,520
Instead, we often end up with an attempt to produce something that looks beautiful. I was

1591
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:59,040
very weirded out by the aesthetics of the Vision Pro asset by Apple and not so much because I don't

1592
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:03,840
like the technology. I'm very curious about what it's going to be like and I don't have an opinion

1593
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:10,480
yet. But the aesthetics of the presentation and so on were so uncanny valley-esque to me.

1594
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:21,840
The characters being extremely plastic, living in some hypothetical mid-century furniture museum.

1595
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:28,160
Yeah. This is the proliferation of marketing teams.

1596
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:33,120
Yes, but it was a CGI-generated world. It was a CGI-generated world that doesn't exist.

1597
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:37,120
When I complained about this, some friends came back to me and said,

1598
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:42,640
but these are startup founders. This is what they live like in Silicon Valley. I tried to

1599
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:46,800
tell them, no, I know lots of people in Silicon Valley. This is not what people are like. They're

1600
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:55,760
still people. They're still human beings. The grounding in physical reality somehow

1601
02:31:55,840 --> 02:32:02,000
is important too. In culture. What's absent in this thing is culture. There is a simulation

1602
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:09,360
of culture, an attempt to replace culture by catalog, by some kind of aesthetic optimization

1603
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:14,320
that is not the result of having a sustainable life, a sustainable human relationships with

1604
02:32:14,320 --> 02:32:22,160
houses that work for you and a mode of living that works for you in which these glasses fit

1605
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:26,560
in naturally. I guess that's also why so many people are veered out about the product because

1606
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:31,040
they don't know how is this actually going to fit into my life and into my human relationships

1607
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:35,680
because the way in which it was presented in these videos didn't seem to be credible.

1608
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:43,600
Do you think AI, when it's deployed by companies like Microsoft and Google and Meta,

1609
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:51,120
will have the same issue of being weirdly corporate? There'd be some uncanny valley,

1610
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:55,840
some weirdness to the whole presentation. I've gotten a chance to talk to George Hotz. He

1611
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:01,200
believes everything should be open source and decentralized and there then we shall have the

1612
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:10,000
AI of the people and it'll maintain a grounding to the magic that's humanity, that's the human

1613
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:16,880
condition, that corporations will destroy the magic. I believe that if we make everything

1614
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:24,000
open source and make this mandatory, we are going to lose a lot of beautiful art and a lot

1615
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:32,080
of beautiful designs. There is a reason why Linux desktop is still ugly. It's difficult to

1616
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:39,600
create coherence in the open source designs so far when the designs have to get very large and

1617
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:44,640
it's easier to make this happening in a company with centralized organization.

1618
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:50,880
And from my own perspective, what we should ensure is that open source never dies,

1619
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:56,880
that it can always compete and has a place with the other forms of organization because I think

1620
02:33:56,880 --> 02:34:02,720
it is absolutely vital that open source exists and that we have systems that people have under

1621
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:08,640
control outside of the corporation and that is also producing viable competition to the corporations.

1622
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:16,240
So the corporations, the centralized control, the dictatorships of corporations can create beauty.

1623
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:23,200
Centralized design is a source of a lot of beauty and then I guess open source is a

1624
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:31,760
source of freedom, a hedge against the corrupting nature of power that comes with centralized.

1625
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:37,040
I grew up in socialism and I learned that corporations are totally evil and I found

1626
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:42,640
this very, very convincing. And then you look at corporations like Enron and Halliburton maybe and

1627
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:47,840
realize, yeah, they are evil. But you also notice that many other corporations are not evil. They're

1628
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:53,120
surprisingly benevolent. Why are they so benevolent? Is this because everybody is fighting them all the

1629
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:58,000
time? I don't think that's the only explanation. It's because they're actually animals that live

1630
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:02,880
in a large ecosystem and that are still largely controlled by people that want that ecosystem to

1631
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:09,440
flourish and be viable for people. So I think that Pat Gelsinger is completely sincere when

1632
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:16,720
he leads Intel to be a tool that supplies the free world with semiconductors. And it's not

1633
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:21,600
necessary that all the semiconductors are coming from Intel. Intel needs to be there to make sure

1634
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:27,440
that we always have them. So there can be many ways in which we can import and trade semiconductors

1635
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:31,840
from other companies and places. We just need to make sure that nobody can cut us off from it

1636
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:38,080
because that would be a disaster for this kind of society and world. And so there are many things

1637
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:44,640
that need to be done to make our style of life possible. And then with this, I don't mean just

1638
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:51,120
capitalism, environmental destruction, consumerism, and creature comforts. I mean an idea of life in

1639
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:57,840
which we are determined not by some kind of king or dictator, but in which individuals can determine

1640
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:02,720
themselves to the largest possible degree. And to me, this is something that this Western world is

1641
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:08,480
still trying to embody. And it's a very valuable idea that we shouldn't give up too early. And

1642
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:15,440
from this perspective, the US is a system of interleaving clubs. And an entrepreneur is a

1643
02:36:15,440 --> 02:36:21,440
special club founder. It's somebody who makes a club that is producing things that are economically

1644
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:26,640
viable. And to do this, it requires a lot of people who are dedicating a significant part of their life

1645
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:32,080
for working for this particular kind of club. And the entrepreneur is picking the initial set of

1646
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:35,920
rules and the mission and vision and aesthetics for the club and make sure that it works.

1647
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:41,600
But the people that are in there need to be protected. If they sacrifice part of their life,

1648
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:46,880
there need to be rules to tell how they're being taken care of even after they leave the club and

1649
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:52,880
so on. So there's a large body of rules that have been created by our rule-giving clubs

1650
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:57,520
and that are enforced by our enforcement clubs and so on. And some of these clubs have to be

1651
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:02,560
monopolies for game theoretic reasons, which also makes them more open to corruption and less harder

1652
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:08,160
to update. And this is an ongoing discussion and process that takes place. But the beauty of this

1653
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:14,800
idea that there is no centralized king that is extracting from the peasants and breeding the

1654
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:21,920
peasants into serving the king and fulfilling all the roles like ants in an antel. But that there is

1655
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:27,120
a freedom of association and corporations are one of them is something that took me some time to

1656
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:33,760
realize. So I do think that corporations are dangerous. They need to be protections against

1657
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:40,800
overreach of corporations that can do regulatory capture and prevent open source from competing

1658
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:47,760
with corporations by imposing rules that make it impossible for a small group of kids to come

1659
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:52,720
together to build their own language model because OpenAI has convinced the US that you need to have

1660
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:57,200
some kind of FDA process that you need to go through that costs many million dollars before

1661
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:02,560
you are able to train a language model. So this is important to make sure that this doesn't happen.

1662
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:09,200
So I think that OpenAI and Google are good things. If these good things are kept in check in such a

1663
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:14,000
way that all the other clubs can still be founded and all the other forms of clubs that are desirable

1664
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:20,800
can still coexist with them. So what do you think about Meta in contrast to that open sourcing most

1665
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:26,720
of its language models and most of the AI models that's working on and actually suggesting that

1666
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:32,320
they will continue to do so in the future for future versions of llama for example their large

1667
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:40,640
language model. What is that exciting to you? Is that concerning? I don't find it very concerning

1668
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:45,840
but that's also because I think that the language models are not very dangerous yet.

1669
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:53,600
And yet. Yes. So as I said, I have no proof that there is the boundary between the language models

1670
02:38:53,600 --> 02:39:02,240
and AI, AGI. It's possible that somebody builds a version of baby AGI I think and suppose in

1671
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:07,440
algorithmic improvements that scale these systems up in ways that otherwise wouldn't have happened

1672
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:11,920
without these language model components. So it's not really clear for me what the end

1673
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:17,360
at the end game is there and if these models can brute force their way into AGI.

1674
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:23,680
And there's also a possibility that the AGI that we are building with these language models

1675
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:28,960
are not taking responsibility for what they are because they don't understand the greater game.

1676
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:36,480
And so to me it would be interesting to try to understand how to build systems that understand

1677
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:40,400
what the greater games are. What are the longest games that we can play on this planet?

1678
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:46,160
Games broadly like deeply define the way you did with the games.

1679
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:50,320
In the games the erratic sense. So when we are interacting with each other, in some sense we

1680
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:54,160
are playing games. We are making lots and lots of interactions. This doesn't mean that these

1681
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:59,440
interactions have all to be transactional. Every one of us is playing some kind of game by

1682
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:04,480
virtue of identifying these particular kinds of goals that we have or aesthetics

1683
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:10,800
from which we derive the goals. So when you say I'm Lex Friedman, I'm doing a set of podcasts,

1684
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:15,760
then you feel that it's part of something larger that you want to build. Maybe you want to inspire

1685
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:20,560
people. Maybe you want them to see more possibilities and get them together over shared ideas.

1686
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:24,880
Maybe your game is that you want to become super rich and famous by being the best

1687
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:29,200
post-caster on earth. Maybe you have other games. Maybe it switches from time to time.

1688
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,600
But there is a certain perspective where you might be thinking what is the longest possible

1689
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:38,240
game that you could be playing? A short game is, for instance, cancer is playing a shorter game

1690
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:44,160
than your organism. Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism. Because

1691
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:50,720
the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism, except for some infectious cancers like the ones

1692
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:57,920
that eradicated the Tasmanian devils, you typically end up with a situation where the organism dies

1693
02:40:57,920 --> 02:41:02,480
together with the cancer because the cancer has destroyed the larger system due to playing a

1694
02:41:02,480 --> 02:41:09,200
shorter game. Ideally, you want to, I think, build agents that play the longest possible games.

1695
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:15,920
The longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible while doing interesting

1696
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:22,880
stuff. Yes, that part. The longest possible game while doing interesting stuff and while

1697
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:27,440
maintaining at least the same amount of interesting complexity, so propagating.

1698
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:34,400
Currently, I'm pretty much identified as a conscious being. It's the minimal identification

1699
02:41:34,400 --> 02:41:40,080
that I managed to get together because if I turn this off, I fall asleep. And when I'm asleep,

1700
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:45,760
I'm a vegetable. I'm no longer here as an agent. So my agency is basically predicated on being

1701
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:52,320
conscious. And what I care about is other conscious agents. They're the only moral agents for me.

1702
02:41:53,200 --> 02:42:02,320
And so if an AI were to treat me as a moral agent, that it is interested in coexisting

1703
02:42:02,320 --> 02:42:07,520
with and cooperating with and mutually supporting each other, maybe it is, I think, necessary that

1704
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:13,840
the AI thinks that consciousness is a viable mode of existence and important. So I think it would be

1705
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:21,120
very important to build conscious AI and do this as the primary goal. So not just say we want to

1706
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:25,520
build a useful tool that we can use for all sorts of things. And then you have to make sure that the

1707
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:30,960
impact on the labor market is something that is not too disruptive and manageable and the

1708
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:34,560
impact on the copyright holder is manageable and not too disruptive and so on.

1709
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:41,280
I don't think that's the most important game to be played. I think that we will see extremely

1710
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:47,760
large disruptions of the status quo that are quite unpredictable at this point. And I just

1711
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:53,120
personally want to make sure that some of the stuff on the other side is interesting and conscious.

1712
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:58,080
How do we ride as individuals and as a society this wave,

1713
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:00,960
disruptive wave that changes the nature of the game?

1714
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:04,640
I absolutely don't know. So everybody is going to do their best, as always.

1715
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:12,000
Do we build a bunker in the woods? Do we meditate more? Drugs? So mushrooms, psychedelics? I mean,

1716
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:17,680
what? Lots of sex. What are we talking about here? Do you play Diablo 4? I'm

1717
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:25,440
hoping that will help me escape for a brief moment. Do you play video games? Do you have ideas?

1718
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:31,520
I really like playing Disco Elysium. It was one of the most beautiful

1719
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:39,600
computer games I played in recent years. And it's a noir novel that is a philosophical

1720
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:46,000
perspective on Western society from the perspective of an Estonian. And he first of all wrote a book

1721
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:53,600
about this world that is a parallel universe that is quite poetic and fascinating and

1722
02:43:54,160 --> 02:44:00,400
is condensing his perspective on our societies. It was very, very nice. He spent a lot of time

1723
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:05,520
writing it. He had, I think, sold a couple thousand books and as a result became an alcoholic.

1724
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:10,800
And then he had the idea or one of his friends had the idea of turning this into an RPG.

1725
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:17,680
And it's mind-blowing. They spent the illustrator more than a year just on making

1726
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:27,360
the art for the scenes in between. It's stunning. But it's a philosophical

1727
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:31,120
book of art. It's a reflection of society. It's fascinating to spend time in this world.

1728
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:39,280
So for me, it was using a medium in a new way and telling a story that left me enriched.

1729
02:44:40,800 --> 02:44:47,440
When I tried Diablo, I didn't feel enriched playing it. I felt that the time playing it was

1730
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:52,000
not unpleasant, but there's also more pleasant stuff that I can do in that time. So ultimately,

1731
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:56,160
I feel that I'm being gamed. I'm not gaming. Oh, the addiction thing.

1732
02:44:56,160 --> 02:45:00,080
Yes. I basically feel that there is a very transparent economy that's going on.

1733
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:05,120
The story of Diablo was brain-dead, so it's not really interesting to me.

1734
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:09,360
My heart is slowly breaking by the deep truth you're conveying to me.

1735
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:12,960
Why can't you just allow me to enjoy my personal addiction?

1736
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:21,040
Go ahead, by all means. Go nuts. I have no objection here. I'm just trying to describe

1737
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:26,640
what's happening and it's not that I don't do things that I later say, oh, I wish I would

1738
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:31,200
have done something different. I also know that when we die, the greatest regret that people

1739
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:35,200
typically have on their desk is to say, oh, I wish I had spent more time on Twitter.

1740
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:41,200
No, I don't think that's the case. I think I would probably have spent less time on Twitter,

1741
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:46,640
but I found it so useful for myself and also so addictive that I felt I need to make the

1742
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:51,600
best of it and turn it into an art form and thought form. It did help me to develop something,

1743
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:55,760
but I wish what other things I could have done in the meantime,

1744
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:59,600
it's just not the universe that we're in anymore. Most people don't read books anymore.

1745
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:06,320
What do you think that means that we don't read books anymore?

1746
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:09,760
What do you think that means about the collective intelligence of our species?

1747
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:12,400
Is it possible it's still progressing and growing?

1748
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:16,480
Well, it really is. There is stuff happening on Twitter that was impossible with books,

1749
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:22,800
and I really regret that Twitter has not taken the turn that I was hoping for. I thought Elon

1750
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:28,000
is global brain-pilled and understands that this thing needs to self-organize and he needs to

1751
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:34,080
develop tools to allow the profligation of the self-organization so Twitter can become sentient,

1752
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:40,000
and maybe this was a pipe dream from the beginning, but I felt that the enormous

1753
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:45,520
pressure that he was under made it impossible for him to work on any kind of content goals.

1754
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:52,160
Also, many of the decisions that he made under this pressure seem to be not very wise. I don't

1755
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:56,880
think that as a CEO of a social media company, you should have opinions in the culture of our

1756
02:46:56,880 --> 02:47:04,320
in public. I think that's very short-sighted, and I also suspect that it's not a good idea to

1757
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:15,360
block Paul Graham, of all people, over setting a mastodon link. I think Paul made this

1758
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:20,560
intentionally because he wanted to show Elon Musk that blocking people for setting a link

1759
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:25,600
is completely counter to any idea of free speech that he intended to bring to Twitter.

1760
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:31,120
And basically, seeing that Elon was very less principled in his thinking there and

1761
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:39,360
is much more experimental. And many of the things that he is trying, they pan out very differently

1762
02:47:39,360 --> 02:47:44,320
in a digital society than they pan out in a car company because the effect is very different

1763
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:47,920
because everything that you do in a digital society is going to have real world cultural

1764
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:55,920
effects. And so basically, I find it quite regrettable that this guy is able to become

1765
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:59,920
de facto the Pope, where Twitter has more active members than the Catholic Church,

1766
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:07,760
and he doesn't get it. The power and responsibility that he has and the ability to create something

1767
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:12,640
in this society that is lasting and that is producing a digital agora in a way that has

1768
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:17,200
never existed before, where we build a social network on top of a social network, an actual

1769
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:23,760
society on top of the algorithms. So this is something that is hope still in the future and

1770
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:29,920
still in the cards, but it's something that exists in small parts. I find that the corner of Twitter

1771
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:34,240
that I'm in is extremely pleasant. Just when I take a few steps outside of it, it is not very

1772
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:38,800
wholesome anymore. And the way in which people interact with strangers suggests that it's not

1773
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:45,200
a civilized society yet. So as the number of people who follow you on Twitter expands,

1774
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:52,880
you feel the burden of the uglier sides of humanity. Yes, but there's also a similar

1775
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:58,720
thing in the normal world. That is, if you become more influential, if you have more status,

1776
02:48:58,720 --> 02:49:06,800
if you have more fame in the real world, you get lots of perks, but you also have way less freedom

1777
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:12,480
in the way in which you interact with people, especially with strangers, because a certain

1778
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:20,560
percentage of people, it's a small single digit percentage, is nuts and dangerous. And the more

1779
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:27,520
of those are looking at you, the more of them might get ideas. But what if the technology enables you

1780
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:33,440
to discover the majority of people to discover and connect efficiently and regularly with the

1781
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:40,000
majority of people who are actually really good? I mean, one of my sort of concerns with a platform

1782
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,320
like Twitter is there's a lot of really smart people out there, a lot of smart people that

1783
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:50,400
disagree with me and with others between each other. And I love that if the technology would

1784
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:56,880
bring those to the top, the beautiful disagreements, like intelligence squared type of debates,

1785
02:49:56,880 --> 02:50:01,760
there's a bunch of, I mean, one of my favorite things to listen to is arguments and arguments

1786
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:06,800
like high effort arguments with respect and love underneath it. But then it gets a little too heated.

1787
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:12,960
But that kind of too heated, which I've seen you participate in. And I love that with Lee Kroener,

1788
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:18,880
with those kinds of folks, and you go pretty hard. Like you'll get frustrated, but it's all beautiful.

1789
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:25,680
Obviously, I can do this because we know each other. And Lee has the rare gift of being willing

1790
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:30,560
to be wrong in public. So basically he has thoughts that are as wrong as the random thoughts

1791
02:50:30,560 --> 02:50:35,840
of an average, highly intelligent person, but he blurs them out while not being sure if they're

1792
02:50:35,840 --> 02:50:41,760
right. And he enjoys doing that. And once you understand that this is his game, you don't get

1793
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:47,840
offended by him saying something that you think is so wrong. But he's constantly passively communicating

1794
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:54,000
a respect for the people he's talking with and for just basic humanity and truth and all that kind of

1795
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:59,360
stuff. And there's a self-deprecating thing. There's a bunch of like social skills you acquire

1796
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:06,720
that allow you to be a great debater, a great argumenter, like be wrong in public and explore

1797
02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:13,360
ideas together in public when you disagree. And I would love for Twitter to elevate those folks,

1798
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:17,120
elevate those kinds of conversations. It already does in some sense. But

1799
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:24,560
also if it elevates them too much, then you get this phenomenon on Clubhouse where you always get

1800
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:30,560
dragged on stage. And I found this very stressful because it was too intense. I don't like to be

1801
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:37,200
dragged on stage all the time. I think once a week is enough. And also when I met Lee the first time,

1802
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:43,760
I found that a lot of people seemed to be shocked by the fact that he was being very aggressive as

1803
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:49,920
their results, that he didn't seem to show a lot of sensibility in the way in which he was criticizing

1804
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:54,960
what they were doing and being dismissive of the work of others. And that was not, I think,

1805
02:51:54,960 --> 02:51:59,840
in any way a shortcoming of him because I noticed that he was much, much more dismissive with respect

1806
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:05,840
to his own work. It was his general stance. And I felt that this general stance is creating a lot

1807
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:11,920
of liability for him because really a lot of people take offense at him being not like their

1808
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:17,840
Carnegie character who's always smooth and make sure that everybody likes him. So I really respect

1809
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:23,760
that he is willing to take that risk and to be wrong in public and to offend people.

1810
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:27,760
And he doesn't do this in any bad way. It's just most people feel, or not all people,

1811
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:33,760
recognize this. And so I can be much more aggressive with him than I can be with many

1812
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:38,640
other people who don't play the same game because he understands the way and the spirit in which I

1813
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:43,440
respond to him. I think that's a fun and that's a beautiful game. It's ultimately a productive one.

1814
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:47,600
And speaking of taking that risk, you tweeted,

1815
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:54,480
when you have the choice between being a creator, consumer, or redistributor, always go for creation.

1816
02:52:55,760 --> 02:53:00,800
Not only does it lead to a more beautiful world, but also to a much more satisfying life for

1817
02:53:00,800 --> 02:53:05,840
yourself. And don't get stuck preparing yourself for the journey. The time is always now.

1818
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:11,760
So let me ask for advice. What advice would you give on how to become such a creator?

1819
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:20,480
On Twitter, in your own life? I was very lucky to be alive at the time of the collapse of Eastern

1820
02:53:20,480 --> 02:53:26,320
Germany and the transition into Western Germany. And me and my friends and most of the people I

1821
02:53:26,320 --> 02:53:32,320
knew were East Germans. And we were very poor because we didn't have money. And all the capital

1822
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:36,640
was invested in Germany and they bought our factories and shut them down because they were

1823
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:44,080
mostly only interested in the market rather than creating new production capacity. And so cities

1824
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:51,120
were poor and in disrepair and we could not afford things. And I could not afford to go into a

1825
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:57,920
restaurant and order a meal there. I would have to cook at home. But I also thought, why not just

1826
02:53:57,920 --> 02:54:03,280
have a restaurant with my friends? So we would open up a cafe with friends and a restaurant and

1827
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:07,600
we would cook for each other in these restaurants and also invite the general public and they could

1828
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:14,640
donate. And eventually this became so big that we could turn this into some incorporated form and

1829
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:19,360
it became a regular restaurant at some point. Or if we did the same thing with a movie theater,

1830
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:26,320
we would not be able to afford to pay 12 marks to watch a movie. But why not just create our

1831
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:33,440
own movie theater and then invite people to pay and we would rent the movies in a way in which

1832
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:38,960
a movie theater does. But it would be a community movie theater in which everybody who wants to

1833
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:44,800
help can watch for free and builds this thing and renovates the building. And so we ended up creating

1834
02:54:44,800 --> 02:54:50,160
lots and lots of infrastructure. And I think when you are young and you don't have money,

1835
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:54,560
move to a place where this is still happening. Move to one of those places that are undeveloped

1836
02:54:54,560 --> 02:54:58,720
and where you get a critical mass of other people who are starting to build infrastructure

1837
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:03,040
to live in. And that's super satisfying because you're not just creating infrastructure, but you're

1838
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:09,120
creating a small society that is building culture and ways to interact with each other. And that's

1839
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:16,720
much, much more satisfying than going into some kind of chain and get your needs met by ordering

1840
02:55:16,720 --> 02:55:21,120
food from this chain and so on. So not just consuming culture, but creating culture.

1841
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:25,680
And you don't always have that choice. That's why I prefaced it when you do have the choice.

1842
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:29,120
And there are many roles that need to be played. We need people who take care of

1843
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:33,520
our distribution in society and so on. But when you have the choice to create something,

1844
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:39,280
always go for creation. It's so much more satisfying. And this is what life is about, I think.

1845
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:47,520
Speaking of which, you retweeted this meme of a life of a philosopher in a nutshell.

1846
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:53,760
It's birth and death and in between. It's a chubby guy and it says, why though?

1847
02:55:57,680 --> 02:55:58,960
What do you think is the answer to that?

1848
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:07,280
Well, the answer is that everything that can exist might exist. And in many ways,

1849
02:56:07,280 --> 02:56:12,800
you take an ecological perspective, the same way as when you look at human opinions and cultures.

1850
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:17,680
It's not that there is right and wrong opinions when you look at this from this ecological

1851
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:22,960
perspective. But every opinion that fits between two human ears might be between two human ears.

1852
02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:29,680
And so when I see a strange opinion on social media, it's not that I feel that I have a need

1853
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:35,680
to get upset. It's often more that I, oh, there you are. And when an opinion is incentivized,

1854
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:40,960
then it's going to be abundant. And when you take this ecological perspective also on yourself and

1855
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:45,360
you realize you're just one of these mushrooms that are popping up and doing this thing. And you

1856
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:51,120
can, depending on where you chose to grow and where you happen to grow, you can flourish or not

1857
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:55,520
doing this or that strategy. And it's still all the same life at some level. It's all the

1858
02:56:55,520 --> 02:57:00,640
same experience of being a conscious being in the world. And you do have some choice about

1859
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:07,200
who you want to be more than any other animal has. That to me is fascinating. And so I think that

1860
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:14,240
rather than asking yourself what is the one way to think about what are the possibilities that I

1861
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:18,480
have, what would be the most interesting way to be that I can be. Because everything is possible.

1862
02:57:18,480 --> 02:57:22,800
So you get to explore that. Not everything is possible. Many things fail. Most things fail.

1863
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:29,680
But often there are possibilities that we are not seeing, especially if we choose who we are.

1864
02:57:32,480 --> 02:57:33,760
To the degree we can choose.

1865
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:44,400
Yasha, you're one of my favorite humans in this world. Consciousness is to merge with for a brief

1866
02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:51,040
moment of time. It's always an honor. It always blows my mind. It will take me days if not weeks

1867
02:57:51,040 --> 02:58:00,480
to recover. And I already miss our chats. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for speaking with me

1868
02:58:00,480 --> 02:58:05,680
so many times. Thank you so much for all the ideas you put out into the world.

1869
02:58:06,320 --> 02:58:12,240
And I'm a huge fan of following you now in this interesting, weird time we're going through with

1870
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:18,000
AI. So thank you again for talking today. Thank you, Lex, for this conversation. I enjoyed it

1871
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:23,120
very much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yasha Bach. To support this podcast,

1872
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:28,400
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

1873
02:58:28,400 --> 02:58:34,560
the psychologist Carl Jung. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,

1874
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:42,560
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore

1875
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:47,840
not popular. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
