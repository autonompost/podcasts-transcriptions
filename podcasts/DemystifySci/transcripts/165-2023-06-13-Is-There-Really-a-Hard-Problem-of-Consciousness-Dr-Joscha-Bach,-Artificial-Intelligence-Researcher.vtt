00:00.000 --> 00:26.160
Anastasia, I believe, was taunting you on Twitter or something over the hard question

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
of consciousness.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.440
I think I was mostly taunting all of Twitter because something that I've really struggled

00:31.440 --> 00:36.640
with is that I haven't been able to find someone who can satisfactorily explain the

00:36.640 --> 00:39.120
hard problem of consciousness to me.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.200
And every time somebody explains it, I'm like, that doesn't seem like a problem.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200
Yes.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.440
So the unusual way in which you're looking at it is not so much that you have difficulty

00:48.440 --> 00:52.520
understanding the hard problem, but you have difficulty to understand by others think the

00:52.520 --> 00:53.520
problem is hard.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
Right?

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
I think I might help with that.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
That's what I was hoping for.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.800
Despite that being the unusual perspective.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.400
And so it's funny because that's what I said on Twitter.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.360
I'm like, can somebody please explain to me why this problem is hard?

01:06.360 --> 01:09.080
And somebody was like, you need to talk to Josje.

01:09.080 --> 01:13.960
And I was like, I emailed Josje a while ago, but we were, we started the show as puppets.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.600
I don't know.

01:15.600 --> 01:21.840
So we were, we built these giant aliens and we would puppet the interviews because we

01:21.840 --> 01:29.640
wanted, we decided that the ideas that we wanted to explore scientifically were so far

01:29.640 --> 01:34.920
out because the goal of the show is to explore the theories that will overturn current paradigms

01:34.920 --> 01:38.520
in geology, cosmology, biology, physics, whatever.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.600
And so we always find people that have these kind of weird ideas and we were like, okay,

01:42.600 --> 01:48.780
this will be more acceptable if it's not humans doing the conversation, but it's aliens.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.380
Because then there's this fictional frame that people can be comfortable in.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.380
And after-

01:52.380 --> 01:55.460
I think we were, to be honest, I think we were a little scared of putting ourselves,

01:55.460 --> 01:57.780
our faces and just being people on the internet.

01:57.780 --> 02:02.100
We really wanted, we were scared of that initially, but we got over it.

02:02.100 --> 02:06.260
One of our mentors was like, you have to stop this.

02:06.260 --> 02:10.940
He actually came on the show and he talked to the puppets for like three hours, no longer.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.640
We recorded a bunch of episodes with him.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.880
And then at the end he was like, what you're doing is great.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.700
You can't keep doing it this way.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.300
And then after that we got rid of the puppets, they're in a box in a closet.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.020
And so here we are.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.640
And so I think I emailed you when we were still the alien puppets, and that's a really

02:28.640 --> 02:32.620
hard sell for people because you have to be like, hey, would you come on the show and

02:32.620 --> 02:36.220
be interviewed by aliens that are puppets?

02:36.220 --> 02:39.940
And everyone was like, no.

02:39.940 --> 02:44.100
Well, I think we are anthropomorphizing people too much.

02:44.100 --> 02:48.780
So principle open to trying different presentations.

02:48.780 --> 02:52.700
Sometimes the puppet is limited because you can express less.

02:52.700 --> 02:56.700
I think the idea of making something that is not human, but more expressive than a human

02:56.700 --> 03:00.580
being, that would be potentially quite interesting as an experiment.

03:00.580 --> 03:05.660
I think that's what really killed it is we couldn't make eye contact and we couldn't

03:05.660 --> 03:08.780
having a conversation is so much more than the words that are happening, right?

03:08.780 --> 03:13.880
That's why it's often difficult to talk to people on the telephone about very serious

03:13.880 --> 03:19.280
or important matters because you can't see them and gauge their reaction.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.200
Of course you could puppetify the interview after the fact.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
That's true.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.200
That'd be a lot of work though.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.520
So we try to put out two of these a week.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.480
You'll probably notice us, by the way, we do like camera changes during the show.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.560
So don't be alarmed.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.640
We don't want to edit later.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.740
So we try to get it all while we're recording.

03:38.740 --> 03:43.100
One thing that might be good is if I can do a very, very brief phone call at 11.30.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.740
And then we have time probably way into the afternoon.

03:46.740 --> 03:47.740
Okay.

03:47.740 --> 03:48.740
Fantastic.

03:48.740 --> 03:49.740
So basically we have open-ended.

03:49.740 --> 03:50.740
That's incredible.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.220
If we do this two or three hours, that's fine.

03:52.220 --> 03:54.260
Do you want to just start after the phone call?

03:54.260 --> 03:55.780
Yeah, let's do that.

03:55.780 --> 04:01.820
We can spend the next 10 minutes just chatting about...

04:01.820 --> 04:06.420
It seemed to me that you have career questions that you are pondering.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.420
Is this correct?

04:08.420 --> 04:15.180
I'm interested in the way that people shape their lives when they have more freedom than

04:15.180 --> 04:18.700
the average person.

04:18.700 --> 04:23.740
Because I think that most people show up and they work at a place and they stay there and

04:23.740 --> 04:29.660
they advance on the basis of necessity and availability.

04:29.660 --> 04:34.480
And then there's other people who stop and they look around and they really plan what

04:34.480 --> 04:35.900
it is that they want.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.900
Yes.

04:37.380 --> 04:43.420
So the question is mostly how to get rid of your fear and that seems to be the hard thing.

04:43.420 --> 04:49.620
I recently watched a presentation by Sam Altman where he told the story that he often watches

04:49.620 --> 04:54.740
people who decide to start a company first so they become free and then can do the thing

04:54.740 --> 04:56.060
that they want.

04:56.060 --> 04:59.060
And his perspective that never works.

04:59.060 --> 05:03.580
Basically people always get stuck doing their company and not achieving the thing that they

05:03.580 --> 05:06.100
actually wanted to do.

05:07.020 --> 05:09.780
So to him that's not a very good strategy.

05:09.780 --> 05:14.300
Then again I think that his perspective is also a little bit unfair because not starting

05:14.300 --> 05:18.100
a company and just doing the thing that you want also doesn't work.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.100
So it's tricky.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.100
It's an alignment issue.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.100
Yeah.

05:22.100 --> 05:27.100
But I find when I want to talk to my former self and mostly want to tell my former self

05:27.100 --> 05:32.180
that I shouldn't worry so much like you'll never be rich but there will always be enough

05:32.380 --> 05:36.900
money to keep you and your family afloat.

05:36.900 --> 05:41.060
Just do the thing that you want to do and do it well because if the thing that you want

05:41.060 --> 05:47.100
to do is sufficiently important and there are too few people doing it you will be able

05:47.100 --> 05:49.220
to do it.

05:49.220 --> 05:55.060
And so besides that I would say I should be a lot more calmer because despite my tastes

05:55.060 --> 06:00.740
being very rare they have a reason for the things that I'm doing and for the stuff that

06:00.740 --> 06:06.380
I'm interested in and institutions have reasons for not finding this and there's actual reasons

06:06.380 --> 06:10.460
but not good reasons.

06:10.460 --> 06:16.500
That's a huge part of what we processed before starting this project where it was possible

06:16.500 --> 06:21.420
to continue down the line and to stay in the academic world but it was always going to

06:21.420 --> 06:25.080
be tangential to the things that we wanted.

06:25.080 --> 06:30.340
And it's hard in the density of media that there is in the world right now to start a

06:30.380 --> 06:37.580
project like this because there's 30 million podcasts.

06:37.580 --> 06:45.580
And so most of them have two or three episodes but still that's a reflection of just how

06:45.580 --> 06:51.100
saturated the space is and it took us not that long to figure out that we were putting

06:51.100 --> 06:55.180
something into the world that people really wanted and so it's allowed us to continue

06:55.180 --> 06:58.300
but it's also...

06:58.300 --> 07:04.540
Well one thing that's been really shocking to me is that you don't need a huge audience

07:04.540 --> 07:09.740
but you do need an audience that's really good and really supportive and really really

07:09.740 --> 07:12.640
interested in what you're doing.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.340
Because we've been able to basically support ourselves with a pretty modest audience at

07:17.340 --> 07:24.540
this point because our proportion of patrons to audience is kind of unheard of.

07:24.540 --> 07:28.100
The people who listen to our show really care about these topics a lot.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.700
But there's just not that many people that we've found so far.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.060
I mean we've only been doing this for a year and a half.

07:34.060 --> 07:38.380
There's just a small audience for these niche ideas it seems like too.

07:38.380 --> 07:39.860
So that was kind of shocking to me.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.860
That's not quite true.

07:40.860 --> 07:46.660
I found that the Lex Friedman podcasts in some sense are serving a similar audience

07:46.660 --> 07:49.580
and Lex arguably is not even that good.

07:49.580 --> 07:54.860
He prepares himself well and so on and he tries to be serious about what he does and

07:54.940 --> 07:58.420
he treats the people that he gets on the show very well.

07:58.420 --> 08:04.340
But I think his main appeal is the speakers that he gets on the show.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.020
He's really well connected right?

08:06.020 --> 08:11.620
He's buddies with Joe Rogan and he had an enormous platform right out of the gate.

08:11.620 --> 08:17.820
Yeah I mean he I think started out just playing his MIT card relatively well and then turning

08:17.820 --> 08:21.700
this into a brand that he carefully curated.

08:21.740 --> 08:28.540
And he gets millions of views for single shows which for a science tech podcast is really

08:28.540 --> 08:29.540
a lot.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.800
Yeah it's incredible.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.500
And if you see the things that really fly you notice that of course if you want to do

08:35.500 --> 08:40.300
audience maximizing you have to do something completely different.

08:40.300 --> 08:45.940
I've noticed that there's a lot of podcasts that get trapped by an audience that can be

08:45.940 --> 08:46.940
readily mined.

08:46.980 --> 08:52.300
I don't know if you've noticed that there's some big ish podcasts not Lex Friedman sized

08:52.300 --> 08:57.340
that are really into UFOs, that are really into crystal healing.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.340
There's all these different…

08:58.340 --> 09:02.420
Well they start off as interested in all sorts of sciences and then they find out that they

09:02.420 --> 09:09.220
get the most views from say UFO videos or ancient aliens, I don't know, these sort

09:09.220 --> 09:16.420
of fantastical niches and that's all they end up doing for the rest of their career.

09:16.460 --> 09:21.340
I think it's a little bit depressing for them in the end because they're forced into

09:21.340 --> 09:24.020
something that they didn't really set out to do.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.020
So we're trying really hard to avoid that.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.020
It depends.

09:26.020 --> 09:29.220
They are starting out as telemarketers who are trying to get an audience.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.220
That's true.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.220
Right?

09:31.220 --> 09:34.220
And the alternative is doing stir straps.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.020
What's that?

09:36.020 --> 09:39.540
I think Anastasia can explain it to you at some point.

09:39.540 --> 09:40.540
She's our Twitter.

09:41.340 --> 09:47.660
Yeah, one of the things that I love so much about Shiloh is that he lives partially dissociated

09:47.660 --> 09:51.940
from the pop cultural landscape and so sometimes people will say things and Shiloh will be

09:51.940 --> 09:52.940
like, what is that?

09:52.940 --> 09:53.940
I've never heard of that.

09:53.940 --> 09:54.940
And I'm like, that's…

09:54.940 --> 09:57.140
I love that.

09:57.140 --> 10:01.540
And so a stir strap is, I've never had to define it before, but it's a thing that somebody

10:01.540 --> 10:10.220
posts in order to induce coveting in someone else, usually lascivious coveting.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.620
In the context of Science Podcasts?

10:12.620 --> 10:13.620
Well, there's some like…

10:13.620 --> 10:16.620
In every context, cleavage always seems to work.

10:16.620 --> 10:22.620
Basically, the demand for good cleavage is much higher than the demand for good philosophy.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.620
And in some sense, that has integrity, I guess.

10:25.620 --> 10:29.620
It's not my market, but basically, I see it.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.620
I'm not sure if I'm envious.

10:30.620 --> 10:35.620
I think I would be envious if I were doing my own podcast because it's so unfair.

10:36.020 --> 10:43.220
It is really a tricky scene because you want to remain full of integrity for the way that

10:43.220 --> 10:45.620
you see the world and how you approach it.

10:45.620 --> 10:49.580
But then you go into looking at the algorithm and looking at what succeeds and looking at

10:49.580 --> 10:54.820
what explodes and you realize that you have to pander to people's most basic desires

10:54.820 --> 10:56.620
in the most obvious way possible.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.620
Like, there's a video…

10:57.620 --> 11:00.620
I feel like the Minoan ladies figured this out.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.620
You know, have you seen these?

11:02.620 --> 11:03.620
Yeah.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.620
Okay.

11:05.620 --> 11:24.620
I mean, in an ideal world, she would be both hot as hell and brilliant, but I feel like

11:24.620 --> 11:25.620
those are normally…

11:25.620 --> 11:30.620
By the time that you have to gimmick to cleavage, I'm not sure that you have the top shelf

11:30.620 --> 11:31.620
questions.

11:31.620 --> 11:35.620
I think there's a difference between beauty and grace on one hand and hotness on the

11:35.620 --> 11:40.620
other because hotness is an advertisement of something that you do not plan to deliver.

11:40.620 --> 11:45.620
It's a manipulative game and that is in some sense distorting the playing field.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.620
I love that.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.620
That's very well put.

11:49.620 --> 11:50.620
Yeah, that's exactly right.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.620
How did you come to have this definition?

11:53.620 --> 11:56.620
Just observing.

11:56.620 --> 12:02.620
I noticed that some of the people, some of the women I liked most were not hot and I

12:02.620 --> 12:06.620
tried to put my finger on what actually defines hotness.

12:06.620 --> 12:13.620
You don't actually need to be beautiful to be hot because it is an offer that is being

12:13.620 --> 12:19.620
made despite this offer not being something that is actually fungible because it wouldn't

12:19.620 --> 12:21.620
be sustainable.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.620
That's interesting.

12:23.620 --> 12:28.620
It puts a real negative spin on hotness, which is interesting, because it's in some

12:28.620 --> 12:36.620
sense that unwillingness to deliver almost necessitates resentment in the viewer.

12:36.620 --> 12:41.620
It might be, but if you understand that it's a game and it's okay in your culture to play

12:41.620 --> 12:46.620
that game, it just creates another dimension, but it's a dimension that for instance would

12:46.620 --> 12:49.620
definitely distract from doing a philosophy podcast.

12:49.620 --> 12:52.620
Some communities have strong norms against it.

12:52.620 --> 12:57.620
For instance, when I was in Boston, most of my friends were Eastern European Jews outside

12:57.620 --> 12:58.620
of MIT and Harvard.

12:58.620 --> 13:04.620
I just got adopted by a bunch of people who took me to Burning Man and into their circles

13:04.620 --> 13:06.620
of friends and I felt very much at home there.

13:06.620 --> 13:11.620
At some point, a girl who was not part of this community told me that she felt that

13:11.620 --> 13:16.620
the women there hated her and were really bad to her and so on.

13:16.620 --> 13:21.620
Then I realized none of these women in this community were putting on makeup.

13:21.620 --> 13:27.620
Basically, there was a tacit agreement to not play certain games because it would distort

13:27.620 --> 13:29.620
the interactions between people.

13:29.620 --> 13:33.620
There are contexts in which you are going out for a dance or in which you are flirting

13:33.620 --> 13:39.620
or mating or whatever, but in normal everyday contexts you don't do that.

13:39.620 --> 13:45.620
This is where I became very conscious of it, because it's also something that is taboo

13:45.620 --> 13:49.620
among the women that I live with.

13:49.620 --> 13:56.620
The contextualization of your presentation is something that I stress out about a lot, actually.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.620
We literally were stressing out about this yesterday or the day before.

13:59.620 --> 14:04.620
Yeah, because I had to figure it out when I started lecturing at the university because

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620
normally I just wear shorts and a t-shirt.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.620
We live in the country, we're gardening all the time.

14:09.620 --> 14:16.620
I'm pretty casual, but there's something about making people comfortable in a context.

14:16.620 --> 14:20.620
I guess if everybody else is wearing makeup at a dance, then it would make sense.

14:20.620 --> 14:25.620
It's something about at least putting on a blazer or something that makes the audience

14:25.620 --> 14:29.620
more comfortable if your audience is in a professional context.

14:29.620 --> 14:35.620
It's weird to walk that line because at some point you can just be putting on something

14:35.620 --> 14:39.620
that you're not if you go too far with it.

14:39.620 --> 14:43.620
At the other hand, you're trying to make everybody comfortable.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.620
It's tricky.

14:46.620 --> 14:50.620
Authenticity is for sale when you're on the internet.

14:50.620 --> 14:59.620
The social mores of what makes for an authentic experience inside of you

14:59.620 --> 15:03.620
and between you and your audience, I think, is along the same line of

15:03.620 --> 15:09.620
you have a group of people and there's a set of rules and everybody conforms to those rules.

15:10.620 --> 15:15.620
That feels authentic because the rules have been set at the lowest possible level of

15:15.620 --> 15:21.620
we're not going to interrupt this interaction on the basis of how we paint ourselves.

15:21.620 --> 15:26.620
When you come into the position that Shail and I are in where we're on television,

15:26.620 --> 15:30.620
it's not really television, but it's still that principle.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.620
It's television for young people.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.620
It's also television for old people.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.620
Exactly.

15:37.620 --> 15:41.620
There is this constant question of, okay, well, who are you?

15:41.620 --> 15:43.620
What do you show?

15:43.620 --> 15:48.620
How do these decisions make people feel as you show them?

15:48.620 --> 15:54.620
And how close to you are those decisions when the camera's off?

15:54.620 --> 15:59.620
And how good of a job do you have to do in bringing those things together

15:59.620 --> 16:03.620
so that in an intellectual conversation with somebody over Zoom,

16:03.620 --> 16:06.620
you're the same person that you are when you're later washing dishes

16:06.620 --> 16:09.620
or dealing with the fact that the cat puked everywhere?

16:09.620 --> 16:12.620
Yeah, I think the most important thing is sincerity.

16:12.620 --> 16:15.620
Once you fake that, you've got it made.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.620
I just find it to be the hardest thing in the world.

16:20.620 --> 16:24.620
I mean, I hope I don't fail at it too often, but I find it to be the hardest thing in the world

16:24.620 --> 16:28.620
to just be yourself in a public space where everybody's staring at you

16:28.620 --> 16:33.620
and just really work on yourself to the point that you're comfortable with yourself

16:33.620 --> 16:36.620
and you don't have to pretend to be somebody else.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.620
Just become more autistic, like me.

16:40.620 --> 16:44.620
I sometimes wish that I could. I wish there was a switch.

16:44.620 --> 16:48.620
I grew up in a really close-knit family, so I was born in Russia.

16:48.620 --> 16:52.620
We moved to Israel. We moved to Canada. We moved to the United States.

16:52.620 --> 16:57.620
And when we came to the United States, there was just five of us in the entire hemisphere.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.620
No family here, no friends. It was just this little nucleus.

17:01.620 --> 17:05.620
And so my family was very, very tightly knit to the degree that

17:05.620 --> 17:11.620
most of my parents' friends let their kids lose their Russian.

17:11.620 --> 17:15.620
We spoke Russian at home. We still speak it. We text in Russian.

17:15.620 --> 17:19.620
I haven't lived in Russia in 33 years.

17:19.620 --> 17:22.620
My brother was not born in Russia. He was born in Canada.

17:22.620 --> 17:25.620
He speaks, reads, and writes Russian.

17:25.620 --> 17:30.620
And that, I think, was only possible because of the way that the family was interwoven.

17:30.620 --> 17:36.620
And so I've grown up with this just constant monitoring of people's states, right?

17:36.620 --> 17:40.620
Because when you have this very tight-knit family and everybody's emotionally intertwined,

17:40.620 --> 17:42.620
you have to be aware of everything that's happening.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.620
And sometimes I wish that I could just turn it off.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.620
I wish that I could just go out into the world and be like, I don't care.

17:47.620 --> 17:48.620
I don't care. I don't care.

17:48.620 --> 17:52.620
That makes total sense, but I don't think that being an American is an option.

17:52.620 --> 17:56.620
Why would you give up your soul?

17:56.620 --> 18:00.620
These are savages. They are socialized with three generations of Disney.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.620
There is no culture.

18:03.620 --> 18:08.620
That's me. Yeah, that's right. I grew up right in the heart of America, in the suburbs in Ohio.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.620
I was raised on Hollywood.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.620
America's test market.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.620
Shiloh would always tell me that he grew up in Columbus, Ohio.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.620
What was the thing that you would tell me?

18:16.620 --> 18:19.620
It's like the restaurant test market of the world.

18:19.620 --> 18:24.620
And for all the brands, they try out all the clothes and foods on the Ohio people

18:24.620 --> 18:28.620
because they're the most middle-of-the-road people in all of America, essentially.

18:28.620 --> 18:31.620
So yeah, raised on Hollywood.

18:31.620 --> 18:39.620
We went to church, but it was a very empty culture, for sure.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.620
It was difficult to find my way out of that.

18:42.620 --> 18:47.620
Being at unease with the world is, in some sense, what brings most of the interesting people together.

18:47.620 --> 18:53.620
This thing that you feel profoundly not at home in the world that you're in,

18:53.620 --> 18:57.620
that you dislike the aesthetics of the world around you.

18:57.620 --> 19:02.620
And this creates a tension that allows you to become conscious of who you are

19:02.620 --> 19:07.620
because it requires that you reflect your own identity in some sense and construct it.

19:07.620 --> 19:10.620
It's something that works for you.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.620
Yeah, but you don't have any role models.

19:13.620 --> 19:17.620
That was the most difficult thing for me growing up.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.620
Yeah, but imitating role models are the worst. Come on.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.620
Interesting. God, I had a hard time.

19:23.620 --> 19:30.620
I had a career in music, and I was very much interested in poetry and art.

19:30.620 --> 19:36.620
I tried to look up to a lot of my favorite artists, but I always found that they were flawed human beings.

19:36.620 --> 19:41.620
It was really difficult for me to learn that there are no real idols for you.

19:41.620 --> 19:44.620
There's nobody to model yourself on.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.620
It was just really hard for me for some reason.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.620
It took me most of my 20s to get through that.

19:48.620 --> 19:59.620
When I was in Berlin, we put up pictures in our apartment of Boris Vian and Brentano and Milan Chomsky.

19:59.620 --> 20:06.620
And basically, the living ones, I got to know when I came to the US, like Minsky and Chomsky.

20:06.620 --> 20:11.620
And I realized how human they were and how flawed as human beings.

20:12.620 --> 20:18.620
And it was an important insight for me to see that what makes people great is usually some defect in their psyche,

20:18.620 --> 20:21.620
because the incentives for being great are actually not great.

20:21.620 --> 20:27.620
And so true greatness typically emerges over some disturbance in your crystal structure.

20:27.620 --> 20:33.620
My take on Chomsky is that he is somebody who failed very hard as a child due to being a nerd.

20:33.620 --> 20:38.620
And he happens to be one of the best writers of his generation.

20:38.620 --> 20:45.620
He puts out stuff not in paragraphs like me, but in entire chapters, complete with reference.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.620
You ask him something, he gives you a book chapter every time.

20:48.620 --> 20:53.620
But it's not designed to be true. It's designed to win the debate.

20:53.620 --> 20:59.620
And he's an extremely skilled debater who has won a lot of debates in which he was wrong.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.620
And he's smart enough to realize this.

21:02.620 --> 21:09.620
And I think he should be smart enough to understand the damage that he had been wreaking, for instance, in linguistics,

21:09.620 --> 21:13.620
due to insisting on being right in situations where he didn't have an answer.

21:13.620 --> 21:20.620
And where he was basically stomping out tiny grasses that could have grown into something interesting.

21:20.620 --> 21:22.620
And a similar thing happened to Minsky.

21:22.620 --> 21:31.620
So I think that sometimes the greatest people are also the ones who are creating peril if they are surrounded by people who are less great than them and cannot transcend them.

21:31.620 --> 21:35.620
Most people don't take greatness as a stepping stone.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.620
So if you don't feel threatened by greatness, it's good.

21:37.620 --> 21:44.620
But most people really feel in this mid-width range where they can copy theories and propagate theories,

21:44.620 --> 21:48.620
but cannot make up their own and not disprove existing theories.

21:48.620 --> 21:53.620
Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying this conversation. It's a really good one.

21:53.620 --> 22:03.620
We are entirely supported by our patrons, which you can go and check out the landscape of at patreon.com slash demystify site.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.620
We don't have ads. We don't have sponsors.

22:05.620 --> 22:08.620
Nobody tells us what to do and we'd like to keep it that way.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.620
And you need to help us make that happen by supporting the program,

22:12.620 --> 22:21.620
which gives us time to interview more people, to reach out, to explore the landscape and to make this a better and better investigational tool.

22:21.620 --> 22:26.620
If you don't have the money to become a patron right now, please just share the podcast with somebody.

22:26.620 --> 22:32.620
Leave a comment. All of these things help us improve the quality of this project.

22:32.620 --> 22:39.620
The biggest hurdle in my own life, just even in a marriage or anything, being able to win an argument doesn't necessarily help you.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.620
And when I go and I talk about people with my own theoretical ideas,

22:42.620 --> 22:50.620
recognizing that, oh, I could just win this argument really quickly isn't going to get me into developing my ideas more.

22:50.620 --> 22:55.620
And I always have to force myself to remember that there are things I might not know.

22:55.620 --> 22:59.620
And maybe this person has access to them, even if they're not presenting them in the best way possible.

22:59.620 --> 23:07.620
And my goal is to keep that conversation going so that I can stir up new developments in my own ideas, not necessarily just to win the argument.

23:07.620 --> 23:13.620
And it's such a hard thing to beat your ego down over and move on with.

23:13.620 --> 23:19.620
I had this in earlier relationships, but not in my present one, which has been going on for 26 years.

23:19.620 --> 23:28.620
And I find it has to do a lot with the attitude that you have to each other when you feel that you are basically two thoughts in the same mind.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.620
And you also don't try to convince yourself of something that may or may not be true.

23:33.620 --> 23:39.620
And there's usually fear involved that the other one is going to create a reality that is untrue.

23:39.620 --> 23:48.620
And if there's a mutual understanding that both of you are going for the same aesthetic, that the end goal that you are going for is the same.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.620
And you're just looking at different parts of the world.

23:51.620 --> 23:59.620
And there is a very big interest in listening to the objections of the other because they all allow you to see more depth in the things that are happening.

23:59.620 --> 24:03.620
And sometimes you get scared, but you get stressed out and you're not able to think clearly.

24:03.620 --> 24:09.620
And then there's the question, how can you get back to the space where you trust each other?

24:09.620 --> 24:14.620
And when you don't have the same goal and the same aesthetics, you need a new relationship anyway.

24:14.620 --> 24:18.620
Have you considered going to marriage counseling as a third option?

24:18.620 --> 24:22.620
I'm not sure that I can solve most people's problems.

24:22.620 --> 24:27.620
Basically, I'm too idiosyncratic and too rare.

24:27.620 --> 24:33.620
I can help some people with some of their problems if they have similar problems as the ones that I'm somewhat familiar with.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.620
But I also cannot solve most of my own problems.

24:36.620 --> 24:39.620
So I'm not somebody who is a spiritual teacher.

24:39.620 --> 24:42.620
I did notice that marriage counselors are not being stopped by this.

24:42.620 --> 24:47.620
So when my wife and me had a deep, severe two-year relationship crisis,

24:47.620 --> 24:52.620
we went to a number of counselors who all basically told us to abandon all hope.

24:52.620 --> 24:58.620
But all of them were singles. None of them had a working relationship.

24:58.620 --> 25:01.620
It's kind of like going to the doctor that's really unhealthy looking.

25:01.620 --> 25:04.620
And you're like, I don't know if I'm going to take nutritional advice from you.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.620
Yeah.

25:05.620 --> 25:09.620
And they also had an idea about relationships that I thought was unsustainable.

25:09.620 --> 25:14.620
There's a notion that you're only entitled to a relationship if you don't actually need one.

25:14.620 --> 25:19.620
First of all, put yourself into a state where you don't need a relationship, then you can have one.

25:19.620 --> 25:24.620
Because there's this big danger of codependency that is looming over your head.

25:24.620 --> 25:29.620
But there's another perspective, which is that you're intrinsically incomplete the way in which you're born.

25:29.620 --> 25:36.620
And in order to become complete, you need to find somebody who is holding up some other part of the fort.

25:36.620 --> 25:40.620
That also makes it so difficult once you have this bond to give it up if it's not really working,

25:40.620 --> 25:46.620
because it's going to break away an important part of your functionality that is difficult to recover.

25:46.620 --> 25:54.620
I mean, Shailen and I have been together for 10 years at this point, and we're so intertwined.

25:54.620 --> 26:02.620
And obviously it's like there's conflicts and there's things that you have to get through because that's life.

26:02.620 --> 26:06.620
There's no opportunity to have somebody who's a perfect person, right?

26:06.620 --> 26:11.620
And so they're always going to fail you in some number of ways. I fail, he fails, everybody fails.

26:11.620 --> 26:18.620
And there is this tendency in the world to be like, well, failure is unacceptable and the relationship must end

26:18.620 --> 26:26.620
with some really low baseline of failure, where people behave like it's better to walk away from something

26:26.620 --> 26:31.620
than it is to stay and to work through it and to get dirty and to be vulnerable.

26:31.620 --> 26:37.620
And I think that it can be really scary because, like you said, if you have a two year rough patch in a relationship,

26:37.620 --> 26:44.620
that's a really, really long time. But at the same point, over the course of a life, is it really that long?

26:44.620 --> 26:51.620
I think it was the price that we had to pay that basically it was her first relationship, she was 19.

26:51.620 --> 26:59.620
And I was very of this because I thought she's going to change a lot in the next few years and I'm going to change somewhat.

26:59.620 --> 27:05.620
And I was 23, but I'd been in relationships for seven years at that point.

27:05.620 --> 27:10.620
And so I thought I've been through a lot of things and had made many of the transformations.

27:10.620 --> 27:18.620
But how is this going to fit when she is a full adult? Does she still fit into this relationship or is she able to find a new fit?

27:18.620 --> 27:21.620
And this is essentially what got us.

27:21.620 --> 27:29.620
And so this realignment of accommodating a new person or a new pairing in a relationship, that was very difficult for us to achieve.

27:29.620 --> 27:36.620
And there was really this big fear, do I still fit in or do I have to cut up an important part of myself if I stay in this relationship?

27:36.620 --> 27:43.620
And that's also the other question. If you're a stage designer and you realize it's 40 nowadays and not really compatible with having kids,

27:43.620 --> 27:49.620
do you choose kids and family or do you choose the career that you've been working for all your life?

27:49.620 --> 27:52.620
That was also an important aspect.

27:52.620 --> 28:01.620
Yeah, that's right on the front of our table right now as well. It's a very difficult road to navigate.

28:01.620 --> 28:04.620
What did you end up determining there?

28:04.620 --> 28:14.620
Well, we went for the kids and family. And for stage design, I think it is very hard to pull this off because the way it works in Germany

28:14.620 --> 28:23.620
is that you have to be an assistant for many, many years and very few of the people who go to that route manage to become fully employed as a stage designer.

28:23.620 --> 28:32.620
And so in Mira's class at Kunsthochschule Weissensee, which is one of the most prestigious places to study stage design for theater in Germany,

28:32.620 --> 28:38.620
she was the best one. And almost all of her class dropped out at some point out of this career class.

28:38.620 --> 28:48.620
And the two women who managed to get in did this by having relationships to other stage designers or to a director.

28:48.620 --> 28:56.620
And so it didn't work like you have a family and on the side you have a career in the theater.

28:56.620 --> 29:03.620
So that was pretty tough. And on the other hand, she felt, which we were surprised about Ami,

29:03.620 --> 29:10.620
that when we had children and I said you're spending so much time with them, maybe find some solution to get a nanny or whatever.

29:10.620 --> 29:15.620
And you do whatever you want. No, I want to spend that time with the children. I don't want to miss out on it.

29:15.620 --> 29:21.620
It's the most important time in my life. And she did not experience this at a loss.

29:21.620 --> 29:28.620
There was some thing that she felt I would wish there was a place for me to work professionally and to develop myself professionally.

29:28.620 --> 29:34.620
But it was also given the choice. She chose the children also later on.

29:34.620 --> 29:44.620
We had a philosopher on the show in the early days. I believe it was L.A. Paul who was talking about transformative experiences

29:44.620 --> 29:48.620
and how you just don't have the information necessary to make that choice.

29:48.620 --> 29:53.620
You don't know what your life, your new life is going to look like until it happens.

29:53.620 --> 29:56.620
And I imagine children are the perfect example of that.

29:56.620 --> 30:01.620
Because you're not the same person after you've gone through the experience.

30:01.620 --> 30:09.620
And so you can't forecast onto the agent that you will be on the other side of it because you have no idea what the priorities of that agent will be.

30:09.620 --> 30:19.620
And so you're always rolling the dice in the sense of is it worth trying to become someone else knowing that I will lose who I am today?

30:19.620 --> 30:26.620
And I think that that's for women and children and child rearing that's often the case because I watched my sister go through this.

30:26.620 --> 30:33.620
She just had kids. She's 40. And she was a professional.

30:33.620 --> 30:40.620
She worked at Google for like 10 years. And then she decided that, OK, it was time to have kids.

30:40.620 --> 30:48.620
But she was terrified that she would become someone for whom children were the center and she would lose all these other parts of herself.

30:48.620 --> 30:57.620
And now that she has a child, I think that she recognizes that it's just this is better than anything that you can get out of a career.

30:57.620 --> 31:04.620
Yes. I think that you basically feel that what you did before you had children was jumping up and down and looking at things.

31:04.620 --> 31:08.620
And this stuff is not lost. It's there. It's a part of who you are still.

31:08.620 --> 31:15.620
But you have additional layers that don't regulate this part when there's more important things.

31:15.620 --> 31:25.620
And taking care of the next generation is suddenly the most important thing because you identify as a multigenerational being that is reaching from the first cell into the future.

31:25.620 --> 31:31.620
And it's up to you right now if it ends here or if it continues and how.

31:31.620 --> 31:38.620
So it's quite profound. And I found that I was worried that you would adjust your brain and become boring or anything or complacent.

31:38.620 --> 31:44.620
And the opposite happened. She developed so much depth. And I never felt lonely in this relationship. I'm very grateful for this.

31:44.620 --> 31:56.620
She didn't stop reading. She read a lot more. She developed much more in terms of psychology and self-awareness and people awareness and social thinking and also philosophy.

31:56.620 --> 32:06.620
And it's quite profound. And she became a much more well-adjusted human being during the pregnancy because everything basically got adjusted and fell into place.

32:06.620 --> 32:12.620
I think about that line of living beings from the very first cell all the way to us.

32:12.620 --> 32:19.620
And I also think about it in terms of the spiritual wheel of life.

32:19.620 --> 32:28.620
I think this is kind of like a Vedic cosmology a little bit where you continuously are reincarnated until you get to a point where you reach nirvana and you don't.

32:28.620 --> 32:36.620
And I have this tendency of looking at life as this continuous process that actually reaches back before the first cell.

32:36.620 --> 32:41.620
I was listening to your Lex Friedman podcast and I was surprised that you identified life with cells.

32:41.620 --> 32:54.620
But I see it as this iterative process where I wonder if there is some kind of spiritual event that happens when you reach the point of reproduction and you decide against it.

32:55.620 --> 33:04.620
Where it's a release of the burden because being human is really difficult. It's painful.

33:04.620 --> 33:11.620
The poet William Blake addressed this head on and he treated it as the sin of generation.

33:11.620 --> 33:22.620
He retells these ancient biblical narratives as if having children is actually getting in the way of spiritual enlightenment to some extent.

33:22.620 --> 33:26.620
Not having children is spiritual suicide.

33:26.620 --> 33:27.620
Can you elaborate?

33:27.620 --> 33:32.620
We have no longer stake in the future of life.

33:32.620 --> 33:38.620
It's only narrative now. You have ideas about how you contribute to the future, but you're actually no longer part of it.

33:38.620 --> 33:51.620
I guess an artist is the one rare piece of society that is transforming future generations without generating more beings.

33:51.620 --> 34:02.620
Your value as an artist is given by how much the audience appreciates you as broken to me, but maybe this is idiosyncratic to the type of artist family in which I grew up.

34:02.620 --> 34:11.620
This idea that I have to adapt to the impact that I have on my environment is distorting my ability to do art.

34:11.620 --> 34:19.620
As an artist, I am in some sense completely fine with having an audience of one or zero if the art that I'm doing is good.

34:19.620 --> 34:30.620
It could be that what you're doing is reaching a large audience or a small audience, but in some sense that's incidental.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.620
Okay, I agree with that.

34:32.620 --> 34:43.620
But the other part is that there's plenty of people whose work becomes influential after death.

34:43.620 --> 34:53.620
It's not that you're playing to an audience and you're performing this iterative loop of how will I make the tastiest Frito that somebody will buy,

34:53.620 --> 35:02.620
but instead it's that you say something about the human condition that is so powerful that it persists in the world after you die.

35:02.620 --> 35:13.620
The question is, if you're an artist, would I lose my ability to say those things if I had children and that was where my focus was?

35:13.620 --> 35:21.620
Of course. This poem of the sacrifice has integrity to say I don't want to have children because art is more important to me.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
There's nothing wrong with this.

35:23.620 --> 35:30.620
There's also this possibility that only very few generations are left or we really don't give a shit about the future generations anymore

35:30.620 --> 35:40.620
because millennials suck and zoomers are the worst and it doesn't get better after that.

35:40.620 --> 35:44.620
I feel like every generation has said that about the previous generation.

35:44.620 --> 35:48.620
It did, right? It did. And yet...

35:48.620 --> 35:53.620
Here we are. It means we're getting old.

35:53.620 --> 35:56.620
But look at them!

35:56.620 --> 36:05.620
I was looking at the commercials for the new Apple Vision Pro and I look at these shit faces and there is nothing human in them.

36:05.620 --> 36:09.620
It's just entirely uncanny valley.

36:09.620 --> 36:17.620
It was crazy because, okay, full disclosure, my sister recently got laid off but my whole family works at Google.

36:17.620 --> 36:26.620
My brother, his girlfriend, my dad, my mom doesn't, and my brother-in-law is in tech but not Google.

36:26.620 --> 36:33.620
And so I'm terrified that the speciation event is running along this fracture line in my family

36:33.620 --> 36:36.620
where they're all looking at this stuff and like, this is awesome!

36:36.620 --> 36:41.620
And I'm sitting over here living in the middle of nowhere like, what are you doing?

36:41.620 --> 36:45.620
How is this a vision of the world where you're wearing these goggles

36:45.620 --> 36:51.620
and you're just constantly interfacing with a computer and you're not really there?

36:51.620 --> 36:58.620
And it feels like there is a complete fracture in the entire world that runs along these lines

36:58.620 --> 37:03.620
because you see people that see the demo and they're in love with it already

37:03.620 --> 37:06.620
and they're the early adopters and they're full speed ahead.

37:06.620 --> 37:10.620
And then you have the other people that are like, I don't know that that's where we want to go

37:10.620 --> 37:18.620
because where does it end? It ends in optoneural implants that are given to you at birth basically

37:18.620 --> 37:27.620
that will perpetually jack you into the system and I guess that's the cyborg future.

37:27.620 --> 37:32.620
I don't see any other end to it. Where else could it possibly go?

37:32.620 --> 37:37.620
I think you're too optimistic. I think it will probably be crap again.

37:37.620 --> 37:44.620
This idea that we have something that creates a seamless interface between my imagination

37:44.620 --> 37:49.620
and the physical world that I'm dropped into and I can mix and match.

37:49.620 --> 37:56.620
That is, I think to me, a very powerful and liberating concept as long as I am the one who is in charge.

37:56.620 --> 38:01.620
And I feel that it gives me a freedom to choose my environment.

38:01.620 --> 38:06.620
I don't need to be on an airplane. I can be in a space that I create entirely for myself.

38:06.620 --> 38:10.620
And I can create the inside of my mind.

38:10.620 --> 38:15.620
And ideally, I want to have a product that is going to in deep resonance with my mind

38:15.620 --> 38:18.620
that is so empathetic that it's able to read my thoughts.

38:18.620 --> 38:24.620
So I can co-create with the substrate. I can extend myself into the substrate and I can enlarge my mind.

38:24.620 --> 38:28.620
And to me, this technology is potentially a step in this direction.

38:28.620 --> 38:33.620
I'm just not so optimistic they can pull it off because their taste seems to be so bad at this point.

38:33.620 --> 38:36.620
I'm agnostic with respect to the type of product.

38:36.620 --> 38:43.620
And I'm not ready yet to buy into a simplistic black and white black mirror narrative.

38:43.620 --> 38:46.620
There is a lot of stuff that I can project into black mirror.

38:46.620 --> 38:53.620
But there is also a lot of stuff that I can see in every decade that puts people into an alienating world

38:53.620 --> 39:00.620
that happens to be physical and happens to be 3D and photons that have bounced off streets and walls and trees.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.620
But that is also not satisfying.

39:05.620 --> 39:10.620
I think what you said about it being of your own making is really important.

39:10.620 --> 39:21.620
Because my first impression when I saw this technology drop was I have no interest in joining into somebody else's technological vision

39:21.620 --> 39:25.620
of what my future imagination should look like.

39:25.620 --> 39:27.620
So it's just not attractive to me personally.

39:28.620 --> 39:30.620
But I could see it being attractive to lots of people.

39:30.620 --> 39:36.620
But I'm interested in technology that's going to allow me, like you said, to be more of myself

39:36.620 --> 39:39.620
and not somebody else's vision of myself.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.620
And that's the fine line for me.

39:41.620 --> 39:45.620
Unfortunately, the business case for our self-made software doesn't seem to be good.

39:45.620 --> 39:51.620
Steve Jobs had the choice of building the Smalltalk universe where you can basically open the hood of every application

39:51.620 --> 39:56.620
and applications share code across applications and you can change out everything in real time

39:56.620 --> 40:00.620
everything becomes user accessible and user maintainable and user designable

40:00.620 --> 40:07.620
versus a world where everything is closed boxes and even the developers can only open the box

40:07.620 --> 40:12.620
if they have the pipeline open and have their source code and IDE tuned to this.

40:12.620 --> 40:19.620
So even another developer from another company cannot open your hood and look under it and fix things and improve them.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.620
This world has much better business cases.

40:22.620 --> 40:31.620
I've been really struck recently by how difficult it is to work with the technology that we have

40:31.620 --> 40:35.620
because the future was supposed to be this thing where everything is really streamlined

40:35.620 --> 40:39.620
and the technology allows you to be more of yourself and to accomplish more.

40:39.620 --> 40:44.620
And it's not. It's very clunky. It's difficult to navigate.

40:44.620 --> 40:54.620
Anybody who's over the age of 60 maybe who isn't in high tech is basically screwed by their technology at this point.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.620
It is opaque. It is unbelievably difficult.

40:57.620 --> 41:02.620
I had this experience where Shiloh's dad flies radio controlled airplanes

41:02.620 --> 41:08.620
and he needed to do a firmware update for his radio controller and he couldn't figure out how to do it.

41:08.620 --> 41:12.620
So I was like, that's fine. I can I can troubleshoot stuff pretty easily.

41:12.620 --> 41:20.620
It was unbelievable how many layers deep in the website this update was buried.

41:20.620 --> 41:26.620
Layers of passwords, different portals. I think he had to put it on a USB stick at the end of the day.

41:26.620 --> 41:33.620
It was just it was an unbelievable collection of steps where if he didn't have someone who could walk him through it,

41:33.620 --> 41:35.620
there's no way that he would have figured it out.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.620
See, that's why we need kids.

41:38.620 --> 41:45.620
I would mostly give it to my 12 year old this task who would have joy puzzling it out.

41:45.620 --> 41:48.620
Yeah, that's a really good point, actually.

41:48.620 --> 41:55.620
You know, the tradition of having children to work for you is a long and storied tradition.

41:55.620 --> 41:59.620
Especially to fix your printer, I remember.

41:59.620 --> 42:00.620
I love that.

42:00.620 --> 42:05.620
Further updates. Yeah. Shall we turn on the audio and recording?

42:05.620 --> 42:09.620
Yeah, if you if you could. We've been recording this whole time, but I didn't know that.

42:09.620 --> 42:16.620
So I will turn on the auto recording on my side as well, just to have a backup in case the Internet is not on our side.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.620
Fantastic. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah.

42:18.620 --> 42:27.620
If you want to just start off and orient people a bit to who you are and the project that you're working on right now, we'll just keep going.

42:27.620 --> 42:31.620
Hello, Shiloh. Hello, Anastasia. Thank you for inviting me to your conversation.

42:31.620 --> 42:35.620
I'm Joshua Bach. I'm a cognitive scientist and AI researcher.

42:35.620 --> 42:39.620
And the reason why I went into this field is because I want to understand how the mind works.

42:39.620 --> 42:43.620
That was actually the sole reason I went into academia in the first place.

42:43.620 --> 42:54.620
And I tried to study lots of things that were related to this and tried to figure out how to identify those fields,

42:54.620 --> 42:59.620
which had a meaningful opinion about how the mind works and could teach me something about it.

42:59.620 --> 43:04.620
And I was not very successful at first to find something.

43:04.620 --> 43:10.620
I did study math a little bit and computer science and psychology and a bit of physics.

43:10.620 --> 43:22.620
And I found that psychology didn't offer me theories that I could work with that were matching the observable reality deeply enough to understand the deep questions.

43:22.620 --> 43:26.620
What is consciousness? What is the mind? How does it relate to reality?

43:26.620 --> 43:37.620
And philosophies seem to be stuck in discussing texts that they were reflecting, usually not at the same level at which the text was originally written.

43:37.620 --> 43:40.620
And so I had the impression that most of the fields were stuck.

43:40.620 --> 43:45.620
Neuroscience is mostly not about minds, it's about neurons and their individual structure.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.620
The interactions of neurons are poorly understood.

43:47.620 --> 43:54.620
There is no model of neuroscience that they can plug into a simulation and it produces interesting brain-like behavior yet.

43:54.620 --> 43:59.620
And so the only hope that I saw existed in artificial intelligence.

43:59.620 --> 44:10.620
And in some sense, artificial intelligence was started by Minsky and others to continue on the philosophical project of Leibniz and Frege and Wittgenstein to understand the mind by building one.

44:10.620 --> 44:21.620
Basically closing the gap between mathematics and meaning by automating the structure that is breaking down meaning into chunks that can be computed.

44:21.620 --> 44:32.620
And I realized that there has been a big constructivist turn in the last century that is largely under-adjusted by philosophy, which basically turned the concept of mathematics into computation.

44:32.620 --> 44:41.620
Which said that all the mathematics that can be real, that can be implemented in the physical universe is characterized by moving from step to step.

44:41.620 --> 44:47.620
And these transitions and systems that are moving from step to step, that's actually computation.

44:47.620 --> 44:52.620
And physics, in a sense, is a computational science. The universe is a computational system.

44:52.620 --> 44:58.620
Everything that is dynamic and deterministic can be described as the computational system.

44:58.620 --> 45:01.620
And the indeterministic stuff is not different from this.

45:01.620 --> 45:07.620
It's just, in addition, deleting some of the bits that you had computed before, if it's indeterministic.

45:07.620 --> 45:12.620
So you're interested in the deterministic aspects of the whole thing.

45:12.620 --> 45:22.620
And I guess it started for me as a child, when I was sitting in front of my combo drugs before, when realizing that everything that I could imagine, I could put behind that screen.

45:22.620 --> 45:27.620
And I asked myself, what is it that I would want to put behind that screen, if I understand it clearly enough.

45:27.620 --> 45:32.620
And I thought an entire world, of course, with minds in it that you can talk to.

45:32.620 --> 45:35.620
And this was basically my project when I came into academia.

45:35.620 --> 45:41.620
And this was what I was trying to study for and collecting ideas in my mind for and building structure for.

45:41.620 --> 45:50.620
And then at some point, I interacted with the institutions deeply enough to understand that they wouldn't pay me for building a mind, at least not back then.

45:50.620 --> 46:03.620
I think now the situation is better because AI has become much more fashionable, actually a hype in the sense that a lot of people are willing to invest into niche topics of AI.

46:03.620 --> 46:13.620
And the philosophical project, which has always been an extremely niche topic, because it's something that is so risky as a philosophical project, that there's a very good chance that you're not going to succeed in your lifetime.

46:13.620 --> 46:18.620
That is not the stuff that you could get paid for when I was in academia.

46:18.620 --> 46:23.620
And so in some sense, for me, the question of where to pursue this best is still open.

46:23.620 --> 46:31.620
Should we do this in a large company that is large enough to be able to put effort into niche topics like machine consciousness?

46:31.620 --> 46:45.620
Or should we take the opportunity that we have right now that so many people are interested in doing this and just build a dedicated institution that studies nothing but how to teach a machine to be conscious?

46:45.620 --> 46:47.620
Oh, go ahead.

46:47.620 --> 46:57.620
I was going to say you said that the universe is fundamentally computational, but is that how it is or is that just a description?

46:57.620 --> 47:03.620
And if it's just a description, is it necessarily the best description of the universe?

47:03.620 --> 47:05.620
That's a metaphysical question.

47:05.620 --> 47:11.620
And the very short answer is that I think for something to exist, it has to be implemented.

47:11.620 --> 47:17.620
To be implemented and to exist are for me very basically identical concepts.

47:17.620 --> 47:19.620
That's the way I understand existence.

47:19.620 --> 47:30.620
And the part of the universe that can be described in any language that is not self-contradictory, that is constructive, that's computation.

47:30.620 --> 47:37.620
And so if you think about computational objects, it means that you have a bunch of relationships between information.

47:37.620 --> 47:45.620
And when that thing is causally relevant, so it interacts with an observer, for instance, and that includes the observer itself, it needs to be dynamic.

47:45.620 --> 47:49.620
And so at the core of everything that exists is state transitions.

47:49.620 --> 47:52.620
It's basically changes in information.

47:52.620 --> 47:56.620
And the meaning of information is its relationship to change in other information.

47:56.620 --> 47:59.620
It's a very general way to thinking about stuff.

48:00.620 --> 48:07.620
And curiously, if we look at the entire history of science and metaphysics, it doesn't seem to be a viable alternative to this.

48:07.620 --> 48:18.620
There's basically no other way to build representational systems in which I can think, talk, observe about anything or in which anything can be implemented to exist than computational frameworks.

48:18.620 --> 48:22.620
So computation doesn't mean you have this particular von Neumann computer.

48:22.620 --> 48:24.620
This is not a particular kind of machine.

48:24.620 --> 48:25.620
It's more general than this.

48:25.620 --> 48:34.620
The Church-Truing thesis basically says that all these systems in which we can define state transitions are ultimately equivalent to each other to the point where they run out of resources.

48:36.620 --> 48:47.620
See, the way that I look at it, existence is a static concept, whereas dynamics and the patterns that emerge, the motions, those are all dynamic.

48:47.620 --> 48:48.620
They're dynamical.

48:48.620 --> 48:58.620
And so you have bodies, just these volumes, surface bound volumes with inward extension that are interacting in the material sense.

48:58.620 --> 49:03.620
But the patterns that play out, the motions, all of these are on a completely different layer.

49:03.620 --> 49:06.620
And the patterns don't exist in the same physical sense.

49:06.620 --> 49:08.620
The substrate exists.

49:08.620 --> 49:10.620
The rest is occurring, right?

49:10.620 --> 49:12.620
These are occurrences because they're dynamic.

49:12.620 --> 49:16.620
But in order to describe, say, a table, I don't need any dynamics to do it.

49:17.620 --> 49:28.620
It just has an architecture and that defines its existence because it has, we can conceive of this body, the table, and it has a location with respect to all the other bodies in the room.

49:28.620 --> 49:30.620
And so therefore it exists.

49:30.620 --> 49:43.620
But if I want to start talking about what the table is and how it's used and what its function is, then I'm getting into this idea, this realm of ideas where we're talking about its dynamics with respect to everything else.

49:43.620 --> 49:47.620
Its motion and its purpose and all of these other layers.

49:47.620 --> 49:57.620
But fundamentally, the universe is a set of physical objects which are defined by being bodies with surfaces and inward extension.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.620
That table is in prototype, right?

50:00.620 --> 50:10.620
It's a way to structure your mental models of parts of reality in terms of giving you affordances of dealing with the reality around you.

50:10.620 --> 50:19.620
If you look at the actual tables, there are arrangements of matter that can be captured by this type of model that you have of a table.

50:19.620 --> 50:27.620
And I think it makes sense to treat tables not as physical objects, but as a way to relate to physical objects in your own mind.

50:27.620 --> 50:29.620
It's a way to structure reality.

50:29.620 --> 50:35.620
Reality can probably be understood as something like an evolving state vector, the universe itself.

50:35.620 --> 50:42.620
And this evolving state vector cannot be experienced as a whole and it cannot be modeled in your mind as a whole.

50:42.620 --> 50:47.620
You cannot make useful predictions based on the assumption that it's uniformly evolving state vector.

50:47.620 --> 50:56.620
Instead, what you need to do is you take it apart into regions that are loosely coupled between each other and strongly coupled within.

50:56.620 --> 51:04.620
And the table describes an arrangement of stuff that is strongly coupled within in the sense that you can take it apart, but then it stops being a table.

51:04.620 --> 51:13.620
It's basically a function that you describe a part of the universe that changes more slowly than the rest of the universe with respect to you.

51:13.620 --> 51:15.620
And that makes the universe manageable.

51:15.620 --> 51:21.620
The interaction between such regions that we call objects that interact with each other, that is what we call causality.

51:21.620 --> 51:31.620
And causality becomes a model property, a property of models that are derived by separating the universe into loosely coupled interacting objects.

51:32.620 --> 51:44.620
Right. And I think that it's really important, at least in physics, that we don't get confused with the difference between objects and ideas.

51:44.620 --> 51:55.620
Because when we start treating ideas as if we can move them around and perform dynamical operations on ideas, we get confused and we don't have a baseline.

51:55.620 --> 52:00.620
It becomes a circular argument that has no substrate at some point.

52:00.620 --> 52:09.620
And it seems like this is at the core of so many issues in physical sciences, because we haven't been able to separate them.

52:09.620 --> 52:22.620
It doesn't get confused. Physics is solving this affair for itself very elegantly by restraining itself to the part of reality that can be described as short algebraic equations.

52:23.620 --> 52:32.620
And everything else that doesn't fit into short algebraic equations, physicists ignore and they call it chemistry or biology, and it's being left to other people.

52:32.620 --> 52:38.620
And so physics is a particular way of modeling the world, mostly using geometry.

52:38.620 --> 52:45.620
Yes, but it's very new in the last hundred years or so that physics has become this purely mathematical discipline.

52:45.620 --> 52:52.620
Prior to that, it was understood as a mechanical discipline that was bodies interacting with other bodies, either pushing or pulling on them.

52:52.620 --> 52:57.620
And in some sense, I feel like that's a much more sane way of approaching it.

52:57.620 --> 53:06.620
Because right now, physics is trying to absorb so many metaphysical problems when they're talking about the universe and the fate of the universe.

53:06.620 --> 53:13.620
And they're very existential questions in some sense, and people are happy to look to the physicists for answers on those.

53:13.620 --> 53:21.620
But I don't know that mathematics is equipped to answer cosmological questions of purpose, of meaning, of future.

53:23.620 --> 53:27.620
To me, mathematics is the domain of all languages, of all the simple games.

53:27.620 --> 53:33.620
And mathematicians start with the simplest one, formal languages, where you can define truth from the ground up.

53:33.620 --> 53:41.620
Whereas when you try to talk about philosophical issues, you have to use natural languages because it's so hard to formalize them.

53:41.620 --> 53:48.620
And that's why it's very hard to say something truthful in a natural language, because truth is so hard to define in all this ambiguity.

53:48.620 --> 54:01.620
In mathematics, conversely, it's very hard to say something about the actual world that we are in, to talk about minds, feelings, emotions, interaction between people, the actual economy, and so on, actual objects.

54:02.620 --> 54:12.620
But there has been progress, and this progress has been so profound that we can now use formal notations to describe many aspects of physics in a satisfying way.

54:12.620 --> 54:17.620
And the mathematics is a tool for notation, for the most part.

54:17.620 --> 54:22.620
And it has a similar relationship to the objects as notation has to musical objects.

54:23.620 --> 54:37.620
When you think about music, you could say that music ultimately is about making noises and having ideas about these noises, and often describe the space of attitudes and movements in the space of attitudes, and some types of music.

54:37.620 --> 54:48.620
It's about having different types of attitudes that find a resolution among each other, or sometimes it's the progressions with space of attitudes that gets you somewhere or constructs something interesting.

54:48.620 --> 55:01.620
There are different types of music applying with this. There are also musics that do not really work on attitudes, but on other types of mathematical objects, but ultimately music is about some kind of mathematics.

55:01.620 --> 55:17.620
And music itself is relatively easy to find a notation for. You can write it down at a very young age, and you can use it to talk to other people about the music that is in your mind, and you can also use it to talk to yourself about the music in your mind.

55:17.620 --> 55:22.620
And there is an additional layer that is not captured by the notation that allows you to interpret it.

55:22.620 --> 55:36.620
So the notation is to some degree constraining the piece that you are playing, and the actual art consists in the interpretation of the piece and to building additional structure in which you build a relationship to the piece.

55:36.620 --> 55:41.620
So it's not just this media thing, but it's the deviation from the default that becomes interesting.

55:41.620 --> 55:51.620
And physics in the sense is not an art like this, but it has made progress in finding notation for geometrical and dynamical affairs that are happening.

55:51.620 --> 55:58.620
And it's harder to learn this notation. Typically you need to spend a decade to get the basics down.

55:58.620 --> 56:08.620
So you can describe all the objects that physicists are talking about and understand their notations, but it's a similar thing. There is nothing alienating about the languages of physics.

56:08.620 --> 56:12.620
It's just that these languages are also not capable of talking about stuff like consciousness.

56:12.620 --> 56:18.620
So how do I find a notation that allows me to truthfully talk about mental phenomena?

56:18.620 --> 56:22.620
And this is something that's interesting to me. So basically how can I mathematics this as well?

56:22.620 --> 56:29.620
How can I find a way to actually reflect about it and make proofs about it and communicate about it?

56:29.620 --> 56:36.620
I worry that something is lost when we treat mathematics as a language because it's essentially quantitative adverbs.

56:36.620 --> 56:39.620
And it's hard to imagine making a sentence out of quantitative adverbs.

56:39.620 --> 56:46.620
Whenever you read, you know, we were talking before we started, I just published a paper today which is highly mathematical,

56:46.620 --> 56:53.620
but it also has a lot of companion text which qualifies the mathematics and explains what the formula mean.

56:53.620 --> 56:57.620
It almost seems to me like mathematics alone has no explanatory power.

56:57.620 --> 57:04.620
It can only describe how a system behaves, but it's on the real language, say English in this case,

57:04.620 --> 57:12.620
to qualify what that description means about the cause and effect relationship.

57:12.620 --> 57:15.620
And I probably came from a different direction at the same problem.

57:15.620 --> 57:18.620
And I think it started with computing.

57:18.620 --> 57:24.620
When I was a kid, I was blessed with having this weird Commodore 64 that has no way to talk about geometry.

57:24.620 --> 57:28.620
I guess basic programming language is very similar to assembler in there.

57:28.620 --> 57:33.620
And it doesn't have a command to draw a line or even draw a pixel on the screen.

57:33.620 --> 57:39.620
So the way in which you draw a line is that you poke a few values directly into registers of the video chip.

57:39.620 --> 57:46.620
You need to know these addresses and the values that you need to poke in to make the video chip forget how to render characters on the screen

57:46.620 --> 57:50.620
and instead interpret a part of the memory as a pixel arrangement.

57:50.620 --> 57:57.620
And a few choices that you can make of whether a pixel is composed of one bit or multiple bits.

57:57.620 --> 58:00.620
So you can have multiple colors or just two colors.

58:00.620 --> 58:07.620
And when you make it out of one bit, it means that one byte arrangement of eight bits is going to be mapped into eight pixels.

58:07.620 --> 58:10.620
And a group of these eight bytes is a block.

58:10.620 --> 58:18.620
And then the block starts next to it and you have 40 of these blocks in every line and you have, I think, 24 blocks vertically.

58:18.620 --> 58:28.620
And so you can come up with a formula that you derive by yourself that tells you how to find a bit in memory that corresponds to a pixel on the screen.

58:28.620 --> 58:32.620
And once you've done this, you can create a loop that draws a line on the screen.

58:32.620 --> 58:35.620
It's a major triumph when you figure out that puzzle.

58:35.620 --> 58:41.620
And so in some sense, I was able as a child to derive geometry in this way.

58:41.620 --> 58:44.620
I wrote a graphics program for myself because I didn't have one.

58:44.620 --> 58:47.620
It was 1983, 84.

58:47.620 --> 58:51.620
I was in Eastern Germany for a software that I wanted to have for the Commodore 64.

58:51.620 --> 58:53.620
It either didn't exist or was not accessible.

58:53.620 --> 58:58.620
So I wrote a program that could draw lines and that could draw ellipses and so on and combined them.

58:58.620 --> 59:00.620
It's my first graphics program.

59:00.620 --> 59:05.620
And to do this, I had to derive geometry by hand, the mathematics of geometry.

59:05.620 --> 59:07.620
And I did not realize that I was doing this.

59:07.620 --> 59:12.620
I thought mathematicians have some secret way of doing this that is much more elegant than what I was doing.

59:12.620 --> 59:17.620
And the Commodore 64 also gives you an idea of how this happens in the CPU.

59:17.620 --> 59:31.620
So we realize that all the mathematics that happens in the CPU, all the basic Boolean logic and also the basic arithmetic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is done with some pattern matching operation.

59:31.620 --> 59:38.620
It's basically a hashing function that is taking input pattern and maps it to an output pattern in a regular way using a simple circuit.

59:38.620 --> 59:47.620
And so you realize how you can build up the entirety of mathematics, including geometry, including everything that you can see in a world and display in a computer game.

59:47.620 --> 59:54.620
By dynamic objects interacting with each other, agents that reason about what they're seeing in this world and how they're interacting with you.

59:54.620 --> 01:00:03.620
All the stuff that we see right now in computer games and increasing degrees of resolution is built up from these tiny, simple automata.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.620
So you realize that all of mathematics is being built like this.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:13.620
It starts out with finite automata and using a suitable set of finite automata is an axiomatic system.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.620
You can build anything that you can imagine.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.620
And there is, in my way, nothing that you cannot put into a computer.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.620
I wouldn't know what that should be.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.620
There is nothing in physics that you cannot recreate in a computer.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:38.620
Some of the stuff quantum mechanics is not going to run efficiently on your computer or rather the particles that you own by a quantum mechanics are not going to run efficiently.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:50.620
Because I think that ultimately the premise of quantum mechanics is that the particle universe in which we are conceptualizing and perceiving ourselves is inefficiently implemented on the substrate.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:59.620
So there's one aspect of this, which is that there's a difference between physics and biology.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.620
Right?

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.620
Well, yes.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.620
And the difference is that biology emerges over the dynamics of evolved cells.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:11.620
The biocell is itself an agent.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:20.620
It's a system that is in some sense a very complicated super molecule that is able to model aspects of the future.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:34.620
And most of these models are formed implicitly through a process of evolving for a particular kind of environment and then putting subroutines into the genome of the cell that allows the cell to deal with lots and lots of different environmental circumstances

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:40.620
that would destroy a similarly complicated and fragile molecule without that kind of regulation.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:52.620
So basically the cell is able to deal with more complicated environments and survive in them, keep its structure stable due to its ability to regulate aspects of the future visits in built dynamics.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:02:06.620
And in order for that to happen, the cell needs to combine a way to harvest entropy, neck entropy from the universe, basically get the energy that it needs to survive, keep its structure stable against disturbances.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.620
And it needs to have a computer.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:13.620
It's basically DNA with the right head, very similar to a chewing machine.

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.620
And it needs to have a way to self-replicate.

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:20.620
And without any of these components, life is not possible.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.620
And they're quite complex.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:31.620
Each of them is built by physical structures, but our biogenesis, how to get from the first cell from something that is not biological is very hard to understand.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.620
There are some people who are optimistic about that.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:38.620
You just put the right conditions in some kind of primordial soup and cells are going to pop right out.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.620
But there is no proof of this.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:44.620
We can get reasonably complex organic molecules, but so far not cells.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.620
And so maybe cells are everywhere in the universe.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:56.620
And maybe we are in the only place in the universe where the cells have formed or that has been infected by cells that formed somewhere else in our solar system under more favorable conditions.

01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:01.620
Maybe cells really require some freakish accident for them to happen.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.620
But once you have cells, biology is easy because you get evolution.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:34.620
I think that I object to the idea that the definition of life is a cell, because I think that I define life as a form of matter that's able to desire things and then to change the world to fit its desires.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:39.620
And I think that that process begins before you get a cell.

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:52.620
I think that the cell is the manifestation of progressively more complex organizations of matter that are able to change the future by virtue of existing.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:04:03.620
I'm not sure if I'm willing to attribute desire to cells even, and probably not to processes before cells.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.620
I don't think that the virus is desire.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:12.620
I think of a virus as something like a text fragment that the cell cannot help but read and to enact its code.

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.620
And I don't think that the virus itself is multistable.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.620
And so it's not actually living.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:25.620
It's not able to survive without injecting itself into a cell that is producing all the necessary dynamics to make the virus function in the way it does.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:35.620
And there is nothing simpler than a cell that is performing these functions and its arrangement of cells that give rise to systems that represent themselves.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:45.620
And I think that desire is a property of a system that observes itself desiring, that has a concept of itself wanting something.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.620
It's not just an implementation of a thermostat that is trying to keep the temperature stable.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.620
I don't think that the thermostat has a desire in this regard.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:05:00.620
And I also don't think that there is something magical that needs to be added to the thermostat to turn it into an agent.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:03.620
It's basically all just functionality that needs to be added.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.620
But desire is the property of systems that represent their own agency.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:20.620
It seems like, again, I think if I can clarify what Anastasia is getting at is that there seems to be a confusion again between the idea of life,

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:29.620
which is a phenomenon, and the objects which exhibit the phenomenon, which is the organism, the cell, right?

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:39.620
Well, yeah, because you say that it's not possible for a cell that can't conceptualize itself to have a desire.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:47.620
Yes, to some degree agnostic with respect to this, because I have no proof for the upper bound of the complexity of a cell.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:54.620
I don't know if there could be cells which think and which perceive in a meaningful sense.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.620
I think it's conceivable that some do.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:04.620
But I suspect that there are cells which are rather dumb and quite mechanical in their interaction with the world.

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:13.620
I find it fascinating that you seem to think that life is something that exists independently of the structures that implement it.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:18.620
It's almost as if your ideas, your concepts that you form by observing lots of things,

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:26.620
are breaking free from your observations and develop an inner life and run amok in your mind.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.620
Are you sure that you should leave them off the leash?

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:35.620
Because the life that you're talking about is an abstraction that is ultimately always bound to observations that you made.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:42.620
And I don't think that you were able to observe the phenomena of life outside of anything that has been constructed of or by cells.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:51.620
Well, I think that cells are the natural progression of this kind of organization of matter.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:59.620
And this is kind of reaching back to the idea of the Alain Vital, the idea that there's some animating force.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:04.620
And we abandoned it because it seemed too spooky and religious.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.620
No, no. We abandoned it because there was no evidence for it.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:12.620
It was an idea to describe why stuff is animated and is moving.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.620
It was not that anybody had ever observed it.

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.620
But so my point is this.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:25.620
OK, so we have a vision of the origin of life that is cellular in nature.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.620
Life begins when the first cell forms.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:35.620
And we can't solve that problem because there's no way for us to bring together the components of cells and then to produce a cell.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.620
And do you know Michael Levin? Do you know his work?

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.620
Yes.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:50.620
And one of the things that he always says is he's like, look, the strength of your scientific philosophy has to do with what it allows you to accomplish.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:08:03.620
And for decades now, we've had this way of looking at the cell as or of an organism as being the product of molecule target interactions,

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.620
where you have molecules that interact with receptors.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.620
Those receptors come into the cell. They do something.

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.620
It's this very mechanistic ratchet machine, right?

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.620
You can simplify it to a bunch of gears that are all spinning.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.620
And so it's a machine that has outputs.

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.620
But he has a radically different way of looking at it, right?

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:22.620
He's like, look, the thing that drives life is will, it's desire.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:27.620
And so if we can control the desire of the cells by giving them the proper input,

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:35.620
since we understand what it is that the map between input and desire, then we can get them to do crazy things.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.620
And he accomplishes this with his regenerative medicine experiments,

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:44.620
where he can make the body plan of these planarians change without affecting the DNA.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:54.620
And the fact that you can do that to me suggests that our concept of life as cells isn't fully fleshed out.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:09:03.620
Because if you have a state of matter that is, you know, gas, solid, liquid, plasma life,

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:11.620
then the problem of how cells arise becomes a question of how does matter organize itself

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:19.620
in isolated conditions that propagate iteratively towards the production of a stable body

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.620
that is then more effective than the molecules themselves.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:31.620
And to say where that might be happening,

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:37.620
there's a lot of research into the deep biosphere that suggests that

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:42.620
there's a layer of the earth that you can go down deep enough into

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:47.620
where the line between chemistry and cells is blurred.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:52.620
And these are really, really hard experiments to do,

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:58.620
because the people who have done them historically have been going into mines in South Africa,

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:05.620
five miles deep into the ground, finding these weird communities at the bottom of boreholes.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.620
And it's really difficult work to do.

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:13.620
And so no one's been able to really map that line of,

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:21.620
hey, where does chemistry transition into biological molecules and then biological molecules into cells?

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:28.620
Because our technological ability still lags behind the questions that we ask.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.620
It's a very, very difficult thing to do on a biological level,

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.620
if you're applying the tools of biology,

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:42.620
to be able to map the line between molecules, complexity, and cells.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:51.620
This kind of thinking is a lot too vague for me.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.620
I think you need to be much more concrete.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:58.620
In my conversation with Michael Levin, he did not attribute the bill to cells,

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.620
and maybe this is because he didn't get around to it.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:06.620
The way in which he characterizes the interaction between cells might include something like

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:11.620
individual cells are not performing a particular task,

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:16.620
because they are mechanically forced to, but because they are bullied by the environment into this particular task.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:21.620
Not so much unlike an individual in a society fulfilling a very specialized role,

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:25.620
in large part because the environment bullies them into it so they can survive.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.620
They need to find a niche and adapt to it and specialize.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.620
And this is a similarity to how the cells behave.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:36.620
And the cells behave like this because they have enough degrees of freedom,

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.620
as per their genetics, to find a specialization, giving the right environment.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:45.620
And not all cell types are able to do this and will not be able to survive under these conditions.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.620
It's still all very mechanical.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:52.620
And when we talk about will in the context of cells, the question is, are you using a metaphor?

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:58.620
And more importantly, when you talk about will outside of the context of cells, are you still using a metaphor?

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.620
Or do you actually know what it means?

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:04.620
Are you able to formalize your understanding of what it means for a system to have a will?

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.620
Do you understand what it means for a system to desire something?

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.620
Can you break this down to those basic components?

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:17.620
What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to have a will or for something to have a desire?

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:24.620
I think I can because we talked to Karl Friston and our conversation with Karl Friston was kind of about this,

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:29.620
where his concept of the free energy principle, I think, outlines this.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:33.620
And then we talked to this guy, Brett Kagan, who built this thing at Cortical Labs,

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.620
which is a chip with neurons on it that they trained to play Pong.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.620
Did you see this?

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620
Okay.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.620
So do you want to try to find a will or desire?

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:50.620
Yeah, I think that will or desire is so organisms, cells, whatever you want to call it,

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:56.620
life has a way of pattern matching expectation to reality.

01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:03.620
And when expectation and reality align, then there is equilibrium.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:13.620
But when expectations and reality are misaligned, will is the process by which those are brought back into alignment.

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:17.620
And life is the only thing that can do that, I think.

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:22.620
Shaila is cheering. I appreciate that, Shaila.

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:27.620
I just think we have to be really, really careful here to separate out the physical bodies,

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.620
the organisms from the phenomenon, the occurrence of life,

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:41.620
which is what is on the table in terms of perhaps occurring at a level prior to the organisms themselves,

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.620
which is, I think, what Anastasia is talking about.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.620
I mean, I think it really comes down to do you believe in hypotheses?

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.620
Do you think hypotheses are a necessary part of understanding the universe?

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:57.620
Because these are things which, in Descartes' definition, are sufficient to prove the theory,

01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.620
but are not necessarily assumed to be true.

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.620
So you have to make these leaps like, well, it's possible.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.620
It really comes down to whether it's possible or not when you're generating hypotheses.

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:16.620
Is it possible that this fundamental phenomenon, life, is occurring at other levels

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.620
besides the ones that we have empirically observed?

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:25.620
The simple question is, can the words that you're using do the work that you are assigning to them?

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:30.620
When you say life, you are referring to a conceptual structure,

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.620
and the conceptual structure needs to refer to causal structure.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:38.620
And the causal structure needs to interact with all the other components of your model of the universe.

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:43.620
And when I say life and I say itself,

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:48.620
I don't mean that there are no other equivalent structures in the universe that behave in a similar way to cells.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.620
I'm completely open to that.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:56.620
I can also simulate stuff in a computer that behaves a lot like cells and has similar qualities.

01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:01.620
When I decide to not call this life, then it's a terminological decision.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.620
It's not some deep philosophical statement that I'm making.

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:08.620
Just when I think about what biologists have been studying when they talked about life

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.620
and they pointed into nature and stuff moving in there,

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.620
they were very puzzled about what it was.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.620
And at some point, they reached a tacit agreement.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.620
And this tacit agreement is really the dynamics of cells.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:23.620
And viruses are not included because they are below that level.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:30.620
And a car, for instance, is built by an arrangement of cells, but itself is not life.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.620
Even if the car is self-driving, it's not a life.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.620
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.620
And even if the car would be self-reproducing, it would not be a life according to most biologists.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.620
And if you were to try to change that definition, you can do this.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.620
And maybe you find it helpful in some contexts.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:49.620
And just make sure that you still keep a word that allows you to talk about the dynamic of cells.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:55.620
It's insanely conceivable that there is stuff that is indistinguishable from what biological cells are doing on Earth

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:59.620
that are not based on carbon, but that use completely different chemistry.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.620
Maybe there are other solutions for building stuff that is cell-like.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:08.620
And there might also be solutions for building self-organizing systems

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:12.620
that adapt to changing circumstances via evolution or construction.

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:18.620
And they could also maybe not be based on some membrane with self-replicators,

01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:21.620
but maybe there is some other principle that makes them possible.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:25.620
And whether we call this life or not ultimately is not important.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:31.620
Just make sure that we are pointing at the right thing or at the same thing when we are using the word.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.620
That is not an issue for me.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.620
So this is not where we deviate.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.620
But when you say that control is will, then I have a disagreement with you.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:46.620
Because what you described with respect to a system that measures a deviation from some kind of target value

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:51.620
and when there is a deviation, it's unfolding a dynamic to reduce this deviation.

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.620
There is a name for this. It's called control.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.620
And the thermostat has that already.

01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.620
And I wouldn't say that the thermostat has will.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.620
That is basically putting too much depth into what the thermostat is doing.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.620
Because if a person would be acting like a thermostat,

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:09.620
I would not say that this person is acting out of a desire or is a will.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.620
It could be also compulsion.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:17.620
There are many ways in which people do things that are directed on a goal that are unrelated to desire and will.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.620
Desire and will are much more specific terms.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.620
And I wouldn't want to mash them up.

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.620
Another thing that is important is trace where a term comes from

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:31.620
and not necessarily where it comes from in the outer genealogy of scholarship.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.620
But where does it come from in your own mind?

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.620
At which point did you form this concept?

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.620
What does this concept actually refer to in your own mind?

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.620
Reverse engineer this.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:46.620
Break this down into actual observables and generalizations over observables.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.620
That is for me the way in which I think.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:55.620
So when I talk about will, I talk about a phenomenon that exists from the perspective of a willed observer

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.620
or of some observer who is observing a similar dynamic.

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.620
You can't use the word in the definition.

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.620
You can't use the word in the definition.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.620
So define will without using will.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.620
I think you can do it.

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:13.620
Will is a representation of an intention that is upstream from the self.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.620
There are some slight differences.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:21.620
There are people which have will outside of their self and there are some people which have it inside of their self.

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.620
What happens in this difference is that when you have will outside of yourself,

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.620
you experience yourself wanting something, but you don't have control over what you want.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:35.620
You are just the thing that is tasked with making that happen.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.620
So you are forced by your will to do things.

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:41.620
There is a part outside of your control, it's still outside of your mind,

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:47.620
that is producing an intention that is directing your behavior that something is committed to.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:52.620
And that typically is happening in the service of some control task

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.620
that your mind has established with respect to the environment.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:02.620
But what's crucial about the will is this internal representation in which you experience it as a motive force

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.620
that you have to resolve.

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.620
There is another sense in which will can exist.

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:11.620
Some people do not seem to experience this will outside of themselves,

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:16.620
but instead what they experience is pleasure and pain and purposes.

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:21.620
And then they have to find a goal by themselves to resolve the pleasure and pain

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.620
and to realize appetence and avoid aversion.

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:29.620
And so the will is something that is created inside of the reflexive mind,

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.620
this motive force that keeps them going.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:36.620
But it's mostly a redirection of pleasure and pain into action.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.620
And so in some sense there are different architectures of the self

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:44.620
on top of the mental architecture of control that we have

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.620
that give rise to different types of understanding will

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.620
and different notions of will that we observe in different psychologies.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.620
But will is always something that seems to be dependent on an observer

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.620
that is conceptualizing a self-model.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:02.620
And it exists with respect to that self.

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.620
I'm not sure if the self has a self-model.

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:10.620
I guess that even if some might do, which I somewhat doubt I don't have evidence for it,

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.620
the majority of cells probably don't have a self-model.

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.620
So cells are giant PID controllers in your world

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:22.620
and only the assembly of them allows for the emergence of will?

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:27.620
I think that cells are not coupled richly enough to the environment

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:32.620
to make it necessary for conceptualizing their own agency

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.620
from the perspective of an observer.

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:40.620
So the cell can probably for the most part perform its actions

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:44.620
without building explicit representations about them.

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:48.620
And especially not advanced representations like their own agency.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:52.620
So they're acting entirely under that external will paradigm?

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:55.620
No, there is not necessarily a will involved.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:59.620
They're just mechanical in the same way as a thermostat.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:04.620
You said something really interesting, which is that you don't think that cells

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.620
are sufficiently coupled to their external environment.

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:11.620
I come at this from a microbiology perspective.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:16.620
So I did my PhD in biofilms and specifically in electrical signaling in biofilms.

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.620
And so we studied these little molecules called phenosines

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:23.620
that change their oxidative state and they get shuttled around the biofilm.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:33.620
And the state of their oxidation is informing gene transcription, cell behavior, everything.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.620
So you have this complex system inside the biofilm

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:41.620
that is mediated by electrical signaling.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:46.620
And you put that in front of somebody and they're like, well, that's just cells doing stuff.

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:50.620
But I'm like, to me, that seems that if you run that program for long enough,

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:55.620
you end up organically at multicellularity and bodies

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:58.620
and progressively more and more complex systems.

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:04.620
And everybody's always looking for the place where, like, where does this quality evolve?

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.620
Where does this quality appear?

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:11.620
At what point of complexity does it suddenly come into being that you can have will?

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:18.620
And my thought is that the will exists in a really simple rudimentary form inside of those cells,

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.620
the bacteria that are tightly coupled to their environment.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:25.620
They have so much information coming into them.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:29.620
And the set point that is maintained inside of them is so much more complicated than a thermostat.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.620
Like, have you ever looked at a diagram of cellular metabolism in a bacteria

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:39.620
that can use, like, 15 different substrates to grow off of?

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.620
I have no doubt that it's complex.

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.620
The question is if there is a representation.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.620
And I think for a will, you need a second order representation.

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:52.620
Basically, you need something that is conceptualizing itself as an agent

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.620
and is observing itself doing that.

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.620
You need to have some kind of reflexive self model to have will.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:22:59.620
It's a technical definition.

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.620
There is nothing normative involved.

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.620
It's not that I require something to reach the magical complexity barrier.

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.620
I require it to have a particular causal structure.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:13.620
And I am open to the possibility that cells might turn out having such causal structure.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:14.620
That's not the point.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:21.620
Just read Greg Beer's book, Blood Music, and it's written in the 1980s.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.620
It's a science fiction novel that is absolutely brilliant, but it's terribly written.

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.620
It reads like doctor's fiction.

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.620
So the style of writing is almost unbearable to me.

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.620
It's like Asimov.

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:36.620
But the idea is brilliant.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:42.620
And he basically describes the end game of AGI taking over the planet,

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.620
but he describes it via biotech.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:50.620
It starts out with some guy in San Diego reading lymphocytes

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:55.620
that have the ability to make their DNA read right

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:59.620
and have a feedback loop through the RNA and in this way wake up

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.620
because they become self-editing and general function approximators.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.620
And then he trains them to solve labyrinths

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:10.620
and gets the individual lymphocytes to the intellectual level of a mouse.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:15.620
And then he is forced to stop the experiments because his employer doesn't want him to.

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:20.620
And he carries the experiment home by injecting his own modified lymphocytes back into his body

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:24.620
and turning Armageddon.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:28.620
Okay, so immediately from a scientific perspective,

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.620
I don't think that you can get the lymphocyte to solve the maze.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:36.620
But if you trigger the lymphocyte to turn into a multicellular organism,

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.620
then you probably could.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:42.620
Because what you need in order to reach that kind of solving complexity

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:53.620
is an interrelated set of modules that are able to feed back onto each other

01:24:53.620 --> 01:25:00.620
and then to get many pieces of information about the real external state

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:03.620
versus the thing that they want.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:08.620
Yes, I agree. There are multiple issues with this story that he wrote.

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:13.620
The one that you're pointing at is, of course, he made his labyrinths extremely small.

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:17.620
And he built it in such a way that the receptors of the cell are sufficient

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.620
to get a sense of the environment in the labyrinths and they can navigate it.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.620
But of course, there is the difference because the mouse is using optical sensors

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.620
in addition to touch.

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.620
And so the mouse is able to see over a large distance

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:34.620
in a way that is more difficult for a cell to achieve because it doesn't really have eyes.

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:37.620
And even if it has photoreceptors that are somewhat directional,

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.620
it's not going to get anywhere close to eyes.

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:43.620
So it's going to be difficult for the cell to make a model of space

01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:47.620
at the same speed as the mouse would be doing it.

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:50.620
And the other one that is more profound, I think,

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:54.620
is that Greg Beer overestimates the capabilities of the mechanical computer

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:56.620
built inside of the cell.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:59.620
So basically, even if you speed this up and give it more memory and so on,

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:03.620
it's still going to be awfully slow.

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:07.620
And it's because you cannot really parallelize what's going on in the individual cell

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.620
in the same way as you can parallelize stuff in the brain.

01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:13.620
So you can deal with the fact that the brain is awfully slow,

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:17.620
but the brain is faster than the operations on DNA and RNA

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:20.620
And the reason for this, just sending a signal through cells,

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.620
is built in such a way that the cell only needs to trigger an internal switch

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.620
that's much faster than performing read-write operations internally.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:33.620
The cell is also performing some read-write operations while it does that,

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.620
but it does not need to wait for the result.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.620
It's able to do this on the site and offline and is fine

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.620
with these results being available with the delay of hundreds of milliseconds maybe

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.620
or at least tens of milliseconds or sometimes seconds.

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:49.620
The signal can pass quickly enough and gets modulated in the right way

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.620
almost instantaneously.

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:54.620
And still the brain is working at roughly the speed of sound

01:26:54.620 --> 01:27:00.620
rather than an appreciable fraction of the speed of light as computers do

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.620
that we are building.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:06.620
So I think the capabilities of even a really pumped-up cell

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.620
are going to be far below the capabilities of even a nervous system.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.620
And I might be wrong.

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:17.620
So it might be missing possibilities of what can be created

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.620
in the chemistry of a cell in terms of computation.

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.620
And for instance, Lee Cronin has his big hopes for computation

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:30.620
of building Turing machines entirely out of chemical operations

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.620
without having mechanical parts in a sense.

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.620
And he hopes that he can make them much faster.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.620
It's to read a very interesting open empirical question

01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.620
how fast this can go.

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.620
But what we see is that the smarter organisms on the planet

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:50.620
are typically many, many cells that have particular metabolic enhancements

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.620
for making these cells work very fast and send information very quickly

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:58.620
so they can perform rich computations about the world.

01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.620
And this being coupled means that you have many sensors

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:05.620
that are working in many modalities quite reliably with a lot of redundancy

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:09.620
over large distances where you see meaningful differences in the world

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.620
about which you want to integrate.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:20.620
When I look at the AI landscape, I use a number of the AI tools in my daily life.

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:25.620
I sense nothing even approximating life in them.

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.620
I sense no sense of this will, for lack of a better word.

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:33.620
No sense of the ability to actually come up with new ideas.

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:38.620
The ability to conceptualize seems highly unique to life itself.

01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.620
They're very useful in assisting me when I have an idea

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.620
and I know how to execute it and I can get assistance.

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:54.620
But when I hear these futuristic visions of this artificial general intelligence,

01:28:54.620 --> 01:29:00.620
it doesn't seem like a natural leap from what I see in the world today

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.620
being called artificial intelligence.

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:07.620
It doesn't seem like a steady linear evolution.

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.620
Am I missing something?

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:12.620
Is there something incredible going on behind the scenes that I'm not aware of?

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:15.620
I guess if I were sitting down with a few computer scientists

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.620
and we were pointing at philosophers and we would say,

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.620
there's nothing in this realm which reminds me of life.

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.620
There's nothing creative there.

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:29.620
There is no meaningful interaction with the world in which we interact.

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:33.620
You could say that from some angle and some abstraction

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:36.620
to some projection that you can make, that's approximately true.

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:40.620
But if you were a philosopher, you'd probably think it's grossly unfair.

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:44.620
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to clarify that.

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:47.620
Because what Shiloh is saying is he's saying that

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.620
in the process of interacting with the tools

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:52.620
and the kinds of responses that you get,

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.620
there's something about talking to a human being

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.620
where you say something that's imperfect

01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:00.620
and that being can understand what it is that you're saying,

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:06.620
integrate it, match it onto something that is outside of your experience

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:07.620
and build upon it.

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:11.620
And so if you were interacting with someone,

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:15.620
there's always the feeling that there's life there.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.620
And it would be hard to interact with another human being

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.620
and walk away thinking that there's no life there.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.620
But you can interact with a computer program, I think is what Shiloh is saying.

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.620
I think it all hinges on the ability to conceptualize.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:32.620
And what I mean by that is the most primary form of concept

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:35.620
is a physical concept where two bodies are interacting,

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.620
say one body crashes into another.

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:42.620
But from there, you can get higher levels of conceptualization

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.620
which terminate in these things we call ideas.

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:48.620
And nobody really knows where ideas come from.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.620
Obviously, if you're a theorist or an artist or whatever,

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:54.620
you have this experience that an idea just hits you all of a sudden.

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:56.620
And when you're having a conversation with a human being,

01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:59.620
you're often generating ideas between the two of you.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:03.620
But I've never had anything approximating that experience with an AI interaction.

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:08.620
I don't sense that they have the ability or will ever have the ability to conceptualize.

01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:11.620
How do you know that nobody knows where ideas come from?

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:15.620
Maybe you can tell me where ideas come from.

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:19.620
I have an impression that I can usually trace where my ideas come from.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.620
Interesting.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:30.620
I write a lot of music and occasionally a piece of music will come to me fully formed.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.620
I'll just have a vision of it.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:36.620
Other times I'll sit down at the piano or with the guitar

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:40.620
and I feel music coming into my hands.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.620
It's a very strange feeling.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:48.620
But I'm sure that anybody who's out there who is an artist has experienced this.

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:52.620
And it doesn't seem like it's being rationalized in the moment.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:58.620
How do you feel that this is different than you are prompting an AI model to put you as a picture?

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.620
I do. I feel like I'm giving it the ideas exactly.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:05.620
I feel like I am the idea generator when I'm interacting with AI.

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:09.620
But when I'm having a human interaction, say I'm playing music with another person,

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:13.620
I feel like that person is generating ideas as well.

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:22.620
We're both making a new vision by combining our individual abilities to generate ideas to conceptualize.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.620
Whereas I don't have that experience with AI.

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:31.620
I feel like I'm the one doing the ideas and the thing is just sort of doing what I tell it.

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:37.620
I find that my own mind is more like mid-journey than it is like Delhi when I produce ideas.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:44.620
It's precisely prompting my cortex to generate the solution to some creative problem that I have.

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:47.620
And creativity for me involves three things.

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:54.620
There's first of all novelty, something that was not known to me or anybody in my direct environment before,

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.620
that is already there for me.

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.620
The second one is that it needs to be somewhat disruptive,

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:05.620
which means it's not the result of just following the gradient to the most obvious solution.

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:12.620
But there needs to be some reorganization of the space necessary, basically some jump into the darkness and landing on the other side.

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:17.620
You basically bridge discontinuity in the search space if it's meant to be truly creative.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.620
This doesn't mean that the other stuff doesn't exist very often.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:25.620
You just have a design problem where you are following a gradient and you come up with the best solution under the circumstances.

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.620
It's an optimization problem.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:34.620
And creativity often goes beyond the simple optimization problem by having to find a new representation.

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:38.620
And the third one is authorship, which means it's transformative.

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:44.620
I get changed to the creative act in such a way that I cannot do it again while being creative,

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:50.620
which means to integrate the outcome of the creative process and it changes me into something that has already done that.

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.620
So I now have that representation.

01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:55.620
I already know how it works and I can do the next step.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:59.620
And arguably this last part is missing in the current breed of AI models,

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.620
but it's something that in principle could be integrated,

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:07.620
which means that we train the output of the model again into the model at every step.

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.620
And the model remembers that this is something that it has done.

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:13.620
It's also remembering all the interactions that it has to this the environment.

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:17.620
And in this sense, it becomes a discernible voice.

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:23.620
And I think this would be a prerequisite for turning an AI model into something that is able to create art.

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:26.620
At the moment, it's not in my perspective.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.620
It is producing artifacts that look a lot like art,

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:32.620
but they don't fit my technical definition of art yet.

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:36.620
Dali has a wide range of styles that it's going to produce,

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:39.620
whereas mid-journey always has a particular aesthetic.

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.620
And that's why I say my mind is more like mid-journey,

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:45.620
because most of the stuff that my mind is creating, I recognize my own aesthetics.

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:50.620
And I'm able to go away from this and emulate other aesthetics to some degree,

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.620
but usually I recognize myself by default.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:58.620
So I'm biased towards a particular kind of aesthetics in my own mind, even when I'm creative.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:03.620
But do you ever think that the computational systems, the artificial intelligence,

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:08.620
will ever reach a point where they're able to look at the landscape in any particular domain?

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:14.620
Say they look at all of the data concerning, I don't know, how the atom behaves,

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:18.620
and they're able to actually suggest a theory, a new concept to you.

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.620
Hey, I think you humans are looking at it all wrong.

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:27.620
It's actually like this. This is the cause and effect explanation.

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:31.620
Do you think that that level of conceptualization is possible?

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:33.620
Because I've seen no hint of it whatsoever.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:36.620
Without being asked, I think, is the important part of this.

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:42.620
Without you telling it, you are an AI that focuses on atomics.

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:47.620
And solving the specific question of gravitation or the specific question of electromagnetic.

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:51.620
The problem is the current generation of AI models. They are frustonian, radically frustonian.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:55.620
The only thing that they do is basically to minimize the free energy.

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.620
They try to minimize the prediction error.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:02.620
They make a prediction and then, during training, that's what the transformer is doing.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:08.620
And then they minimize the deviation between the observed thing and what they predicted

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.620
by changing the structure of the model. They do this gradually.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.620
And the transformer is a way to optimize this process.

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:18.620
In some sense, it's what almost all neural network paradigms are doing.

01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:21.620
It does this by making statistics over.

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.620
We need to make the statistics over so the training becomes more efficient.

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:27.620
And it introduces a way to make this in parallel.

01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:32.620
So you can use many GPUs in parallel to process the entirety of text on the Internet

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.620
or hundreds of millions of pictures simultaneously.

01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:38.620
Otherwise, this boot-force training method wouldn't work.

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.620
And our own mind works in a very different way.

01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.620
It is based on optimizing for coherence, I think.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:49.620
And consciousness is a tool for achieving this coherence in a self-organizing substrate.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:56.620
So basically, to becoming a coherent observer, you need to establish the notion of being a coherent observer.

01:36:56.620 --> 01:37:00.620
And consciousness is related to doing this.

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.620
You notice when you are conscious that you have a percept of being a reflexive observer.

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:09.620
This basically means there is a control process going on

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:13.620
that is checking whether you are actually still a coherent observer or spacing out.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:19.620
And by implementing this control process, your observation process is able to keep itself stable.

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:27.620
And the process of that observation process is to construct coherence in the world where it's not readily apparent.

01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:32.620
And so we don't just try to minimize deviation from expectation when we observe the world.

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:38.620
Instead, first of all, we try to filter all those parts that we can interpret in some sense and ignore the rest.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.620
And we have a fringe around this, some boundary,

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:48.620
where we gradually, step by step, increase the amount of stuff that we can interpret coherently.

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:51.620
And this is all happening in the service of agency.

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:55.620
We built our models for aesthetic reasons.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:38:04.620
But ultimately, your neurons are being paid to discover structure for producing your ability to change the universe itself,

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:09.620
so you can survive and make the future compatible with you.

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:12.620
And it's something that we don't do for the present AI systems.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:17.620
They are not built to maximize their own agency, and they are not even built to maximize their coherence yet.

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:19.620
Coherence is something that forms in the limit.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:26.620
If you give them more data, they become more and more coherent until they approximate coherence to a sufficient degree

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:32.620
to convince people who are playing with these models that they are talking to something that is more coherent than most people are.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.620
This is also the other issue.

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:39.620
We talked to a bunch of philosophers to tell you AI models don't understand what understanding means.

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:45.620
But you ask the philosophers, and they all agree that they don't have a shared understanding of what understanding means.

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.620
So AI models might be our only chance to get there.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.620
Because the brain is so small.

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:56.620
That's an interesting thing, which is that the brain is so small,

01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:03.620
and so if we are limited by the complexity of our brains, to go back to the lymphocyte example,

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:07.620
you have a lymphocyte that you put into the maze, there's a limit to how fast it can solve it,

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:14.620
because there's a limit to the amount of parallel processing that can go on inside of a cell rather than inside of a brain.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:19.620
And so we accept that there's a difference in ability between a cell and a brain.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:27.620
And so we should also assume that there is a difference, a complexity ramp between brains and a network of brains.

01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:35.620
Because your network will be a product of the complexity of all of the parts, because that's the number of processes that you can run.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:51.620
So to my mind, the complexity inside of an AI system doesn't reflect the complexity inside of a brain.

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:56.620
And so if we want to ramp our intelligence to the next level, we have to have the network of brains,

01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:00.620
not a network of AIs that are less complex than brains.

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:07.620
Because the AI model right now, if you ask it what is understanding, and it doesn't have a good definition for it,

01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:13.620
it doesn't have a good definition for it because in all of its training data, there isn't an explanation that it can find.

01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:15.620
It's limited by its training data.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:22.620
And it has no demonstrated ability to come up with its own definition set that is more coherent.

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:23.620
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:29.620
Whereas if the training data set doesn't have anything that approximates that explanation,

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:38.620
it doesn't have the ability to do this next order modeling, which is, okay, this is how explanations are arrived at.

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:48.620
And I have to do this process with all of the data that is available to me in order to get to a place that doesn't exist in the data.

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:52.620
And it seems like people believe that it's possible to teach AI to do that.

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:57.620
But you'd have to mathematically conceptualize what it means to arrive at an explanation.

01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:03.620
And that's where that weird thing of where the hell does an idea come from begin.

01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:09.620
Because if you're sitting somewhere and all of a sudden out of nowhere, you just have an insight.

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.620
And you're like, I don't know how I got that insight.

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:20.620
There's not two or three things that I connect that linearly produce this emergence of something new.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.620
You can't mathematically program that because it's random.

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:29.620
It's a collection of things just in the right moment.

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:35.620
Your own resonant internal state is at this receptive place where this sounds crazy.

01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:43.620
It sounds crazy, but I think that we agree that biology has a lot to do with phonons, with the resonance inside of materials.

01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:53.620
And so the resonant inside of your brain at that moment is just right to be able to catch on to the resonance of something that's outside of it and then from that to produce an idea.

01:41:53.620 --> 01:42:03.620
But that to me seems computationally intractable to give to a machine unless you have something that is this wet squishy thing that can resonate, which is the brain in this model.

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:07.620
I think that's not secretory. There are many good observations that you're making.

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:15.620
For instance, you observe that your reflexive self is for the most part unable to observe your idea generation process.

01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:18.620
And there are many obvious reasons for this.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:29.620
It's often a feedforward network that is built in such a way that its function cannot be decomposed into a grammatical structure that you could rationally trace.

01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:42.620
So basically building a perceptual system that is working on your mental processes would be hard if you are using a feedforward network with a high degree of parallelism and superposition in the states that are being computed.

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:47.620
And phonons are a very good metaphor, I think, for a lot of what's happening in the brain.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:55.620
There is a book by the ART guy.

01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:59.620
Let me check. Just blanking out.

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.620
Grosberg, Adaptive Resonance Theory.

01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:02.620
Are we having him coming on the show next week?

01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:05.620
Yes, he's really great.

01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:13.620
He basically tries to describe the entirety of processes in the nervous system as resonance processes, and I think it's a very productive paradigm.

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:22.620
At this point, I think nobody has turned this into a computational model that produces all this, but many good ideas in this framework.

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:27.620
But it's still computational. There is nothing that is paradigmatically different.

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:30.620
It's just a particular way to look at the computations.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:39.620
And I keep saying that I guess that sometimes a better metaphor for what the brain is doing is not circuitry, but it's something like an ether.

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:51.620
And the medium of the propagation are neurons and adjacent cell types that are taking the signal and reaching it forward to other cells while modulating it.

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:58.620
And all the computations are taking place in these activation fronts, and these activation fronts, for that thing to work, need to be periodic.

01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:05.620
So there's basically cyclical waves that are passing through the neural substrate and producing behavior.

01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:10.620
And this spreading of these activation fronts is so slow that it's roughly at the speed of sound.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.620
So phonons is not a bad metaphor.

01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:27.620
And very often the neurons are not deterministic, which means that given the same environmental configuration, the neuron is not going to go into a single particular state, but in one out of multiple states, because they're not completely deterministic.

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:32.620
And this means that if you want to guarantee getting a particular kind of result from this, you need a bunch of neurons.

01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:36.620
So statistically of them, most of them are going to get into that state.

01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:42.620
But what the others are going to do is that they sample a space of function that is adjacent to the result that you want.

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:57.620
And this gives you sometimes more power, because instead of having to train your neurons to perform one function only, you can constrain them to compute a bunch of functions simultaneously and then voting on the outcome of the results.

01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:12.620
It's a slightly different paradigm in thinking about how this computation works in the brain compared to our digital computers, which I think is responsible for the fact that our brains are so efficient despite being so abysmally slow and unreliable.

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:18.620
And if you look at the graphics card, they have so much larger memory than our brains and are so much faster.

01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:24.620
Why are they so less efficient, so little more efficient than what our brain is?

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:32.620
It sounds like you're saying that crossing this conceptual barrier requires a hardware shift in the pursuit of artificial intelligence.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:36.620
Not necessarily. I know a bunch of people who are working on neuromorphic chips.

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:50.620
And my own intuition is that if your main task is or main mission in life is to figure out how the mind works, don't start with building hardware and then trying to figure out how to get software to run on them, but simulate your hardware first on a GPU.

01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:57.620
And there is some evidence that for most of the existing neuromorphic chips, you can simulate them on a GPU.

01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:10.620
And that's basically running software that works like this requires you to constrain yourself to something that only works in the way in which a neuromorphic chip does and not using all the capabilities of the hardware.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:18.620
So basically it seems that our hardware is luring us into using classes of algorithms that are suboptimal because the hardware is so powerful.

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:33.620
With biology, it feels like a lot of its functionality comes down to resonance and these multiple states of resonance that layer onto each other and then produce action.

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:41.620
Is it possible to encode analog resonance into a digital system?

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:45.620
Yes, of course. The thing is that the analog resonance has a finite resolution.

01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:50.620
The resolution is actually usually quite small until it gets drowned out in noise.

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:56.620
And it's similar to having an analog record on a very coarse vinyl substrate.

01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:04.620
To build a CD-ROM that is able to exceed this resolution of the analog substrate is not hard.

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:07.620
It's just a design solution that you're taking.

01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:21.620
And so in some sense, if you are willing to accept that your software needs to be slightly different on every substrate, you could build noisy analog chips that require less energy to run than deterministic digital chips.

01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:27.620
But the price is that your software needs to be adaptive, that it needs to deal with how your hardware feels today.

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:35.620
Yeah, and that seems to be something that is key to biology.

01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:41.620
It's the adaptability. It's the fact that today you don't feel like you did yesterday.

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:45.620
And so the product of everything that you do is different.

01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:48.620
And I think that that's not a bug in the software.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:56.620
I feel like that's actually a function for creativity and evolution and desire and will.

01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:03.620
And I mean, I think that it starts well before the complexity of a human, where that's the case.

01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:11.620
I once woke up after a major surgery and asked people how the surgery went while being still in the ER.

01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:16.620
And they told me and they were visibly disturbed and asked them what was going on.

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:20.620
And they told me they had the exact conversation like for the third time.

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:26.620
And it was because part of the anesthesia that I've got inhibited long-term memory formation.

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.620
It was still active while I was in the ER.

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:32.620
So I would not have been able to form a long-term memory trace of the conversation that I had.

01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.620
It was only playing out in working memory.

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:39.620
And then I fall asleep, woke up again and had the same conversation pretty much word for word.

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:43.620
This means that my macroscopic behavior is pretty deterministic.

01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:48.620
And the reason why it doesn't repeat is because I form memory that stops me from repeating.

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:50.620
Because I don't need to do it again.

01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:56.620
It's also the reason why older people repeat themselves because they don't form long-term memory traces of the conversation.

01:48:58.620 --> 01:48:59.620
That's terrifying.

01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:01.620
Yes, it is.

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:07.620
I don't know. I think that that actually fits really neatly into my picture of nature,

01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:12.620
where life is a form of long-term memory formation.

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:20.620
The structure itself of this heritable information that is modulated over the course of your life

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:29.620
and then passed down to your offspring through an epigenetic mechanism is basically the whole point of life.

01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:33.620
And it seems pretty straightforward that on a processing level,

01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:38.620
it's relatively easy to lose that when some system goes offline.

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:49.620
But that just speaks to the way that our brains are a more complex version of what life is already doing on the most basic level.

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:56.620
I don't know how much information we can actually pass on epigenetically to offspring.

01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:03.620
Ultimately, I think that's not a question of what's the most poetic interpretation of reality, but an empirical question.

01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:10.620
I don't know how much racial memory I've got epigenetically for my parents.

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:14.620
Who knows? Maybe we'll figure it out.

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:19.620
But I suspect that most of the stuff is just passed on genetically, and the rest is observation.

01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:27.620
There are probably a few bits that can be encoded during the lifetime of my parents into sperm and eggs and then expanded in the next generation.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:32.620
But I suspect it's not that much because this recording mechanism will be very hard to implement.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:43.620
And so I suspect that most of the transmission of information across generations happens by explicit communication between parents and children.

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:52.620
You might be right to some degree because there is a twin studies are an interesting insight into this

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:56.620
because you can take people that are twins that are raised under different conditions,

01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:04.620
and then you find out what contribution is maintained on a genetic basis and what contribution seems to be defined by environmental considerations.

01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:10.620
But from what I can tell, you know, actually, I don't know enough about this.

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:14.620
I have to read more twin studies in order to be able to evaluate how much is.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:24.620
I think that is a romantic hope that we can break out of the genetic determinism by some magical epigenetic mechanism, but I suspect it's not going to work.

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:43.620
I want to go back to what you were talking about with the hardware advancements that are necessary to produce anything approximating artificial general intelligence.

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:51.620
And it occurred to me that in a digital system, you might have a very high level of resolution.

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:59.620
You mentioned the CD versus the vinyl, but when it comes to actually recording the information in the first place,

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:12.620
people who work in audio recording prize analog equipment because well, not because it is high fidelity, but because of the harmonic distortion that it introduces.

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:28.620
And I wonder how much of our conscious experiences are predicated on that harmonic distortion in a constructive sense that it adds a level of richness to our experience that wouldn't be possible in a digital system.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:35.620
I suspect that a lot of the limitations of digital equipment are due to cost reduction.

01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:46.620
Basically, in order to make this thing work, it's not going to exploit the limit of what's technologically possible, but it makes measurements on a number of subjects in an app under controlled conditions.

01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:56.620
And when the subjects are no longer perceiving any kind of difference to the analog signal that you're done, you don't need to be much better.

01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:59.620
Maybe you put in some safety margin and then you're good.

01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:05.620
And then you can basically scientifically prove that you now have a recording that has higher quality than vinyl.

01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:09.620
But this thing is working based on some assumption.

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:18.620
For instance, when you look at an RGB screen, the pigments of the RGB screen are producing signals that are tuned to your receptors.

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.620
But there are interpersonal differences between the receptors.

01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.620
Some people are sensitive to slightly different wavelengths.

01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:33.620
So if you only use three types of emitters for light to simulate the entire spectrum, you're not going to get the same result for everybody.

01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:35.620
And a similar thing is happening with audio.

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:39.620
Basically, there are people which are way more sensitive in some frequency areas than others.

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:47.620
And if you have an analog medium, your brain has to piece out from this analog distortion what the result is.

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.620
And there are no gaps in this analog signal.

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:52.620
There's basically this smooth property of the signal.

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:57.620
And that is something that I couldn't appreciate so much when I was younger.

01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:11.620
And now I notice that when I look at heavily processed digital film material that I often feel that I see differences in the grain where some filter has been applied and then the filter stops being applied.

01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.620
And this annoys me.

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:20.620
I look at the Villeneuve dune and I look at the CGI and it's very unsatisfying to me because I feel that the foreground and the background doesn't match.

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.620
There's something completely wrong.

01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:23.620
I cannot put my finger onto it.

01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:35.620
And so when I look at the much more primitive tricks in a Kobozara movie that are entirely analog, I find it's much more digestible because I don't see this cutoff.

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:40.620
It feels to me that there is some kind of smooth continuum into it.

01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:47.620
But I'm still not willing to romanticize this into thinking that analog is in principle superior to digital.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:56.620
But it could be that if you want to get something that is completely equivalent, we need to do a much higher resolution on the digital substrate.

01:54:56.620 --> 01:55:04.620
I mean, there's been an incredible advancement in the last 10 years in the audio recording realm, which is where I'm most comfortable,

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:11.620
which is that you create plugins, you create modules which are capable of introducing that harmonic distortion.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:20.620
But you have to know that you want it in the first place and you have to know that you're modeling something in the analog world and that that distortion turns out to be really important.

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:32.620
When people first started getting all of this high tech digital equipment in the 90s, they were immediately struck by how cold and despite all of its high fidelity, it sounded awful.

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:39.620
And they had to really go back and analyze what it was in those particular distortions that they wanted to keep.

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:51.620
And there's really a high art to introducing those distortions in a way that keeps the music pleasant to the ear while actually ruining the high fidelity of the signal.

01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:54.620
It's an interesting paradox.

01:55:54.620 --> 01:56:07.620
I noticed the weird thing that when I look at audio recordings from classical music, there are a lot of recordings I cannot relate to and a few that work much, much better.

01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:19.620
And I talked to some of the pianists and I had the impression that there is some correlation between the pianist being synesthete and this music working on me.

01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:26.620
And they describe a similar thing that sometimes they have the wrong piano and they're not able to experience synesthesia while playing it.

01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:28.620
That's what doesn't work for them.

01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:39.620
And this synesthesia relates to your brain going into resonance at some level using obviously has to do with overtones in the music that you may not consciously perceive when you listen to it.

01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:46.620
But it has something to do with because you're not reflecting on it is how your perceptual system is processing the data.

01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:55.620
And the gap between how perception works and how your mental conductor is listening to what the instruments of your mind are producing is responsible for some difference.

01:56:55.620 --> 01:57:01.620
So you might not be consciously noticing difference between stimuli, but your brain might be.

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:17.620
And so this thing that you noticed that the music that at some level is indistinguishable to the listener is producing a different mood and listeners might have to do with their subconscious processing going on that leads to a different outcome.

01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:25.620
And will that level of processing ever be available in the digital realm to artificial intelligence?

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:30.620
I don't see why not. I suspect that AI is already processing at much higher resolution.

01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:35.620
The problem is that the model often doesn't know what the ground truth is that it would resolve to.

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:41.620
So I suspect that we could in principle build AI systems right now that are able to read thoughts of people.

01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:47.620
But setting up the training with the present stack of algorithms is very hard.

01:57:48.620 --> 01:58:02.620
Well, I would think that one of the barriers to being able to create that kind of digital emulation of a mind is understanding what kind of overtones and resonance needs to be brought into it.

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:18.620
Because when Sheila is talking about plugins that emulate analog equipment, what they've done to create those plugins is that they've gone and they've looked at the resonant properties, the harmonic properties of the original analog equipment,

01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:28.620
characterized how they emerge from various sounds, and then apply that function to the sound that's inside of the computer.

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:41.620
So if you don't have that characterization of the resonance in the first place, you can't possibly program it into the computer because it is a resonance that is necessary to know.

01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:47.620
Yeah, it just seems like these things are always one step behind us. No matter what happens, they can't get out in front of...

01:58:47.620 --> 01:59:02.620
Yeah, it's much more complicated than this. For instance, I bought the AirPods Pro because Apple removed their headphone plug from the iPhone and I could no longer use my pretty decent analog headphones.

01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:09.620
And I hated them because they sounded worse than $20 wired Panasonic earplugs.

01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:15.620
And it was just very uninspiring sound. It was not that there's obviously something wrong with it, but there was really nothing I liked about it.

01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:26.620
And then they died after a couple of years due to an Apple manufacturing defect that they started to crack a lot of half that it was out of warranty for a month.

01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:36.620
So I could not get a replacement from Apple and had to buy the AirPods 2, AirPods Pro 2, these ones. And they're amazing. They're magical.

01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:46.620
They're not audiophile. They don't sound super realistic, but they're like a brain implant.

01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:53.620
They're able to make my brain resonate with certain frequencies in a way that I could not get with other audio devices.

01:59:53.620 --> 02:00:02.620
So for particular types of music sounds, especially electronic, they work much better than other types of headphones for me.

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:11.620
It really depends on the kind of interaction that you want to have. A lot of the analog equipment that sounds very warm is not necessarily sounding realistic.

02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:16.620
It is producing a particular kind of experience that you want to have.

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:20.620
Because it's tickling your nervous system in a particular way.

02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:28.620
And there is a lot of stuff that can only be done electronically that is difficult to achieve with analog equipment.

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.620
You just don't need all that resolution, right? I don't need to hear.

02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:39.620
There's very few singers that you really want to hear every aspect of their mouth moving and so forth.

02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:45.620
Sometimes you do. So there is stuff that I can hear with this that is difficult to hear on very high fidelity equipment.

02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:51.620
Because it is artificially, at least that's what it sounds like to me, expanding some of the range.

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:56.620
And so you're able to hear stuff that is much harder to hear in unprocessed sound.

02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:01.620
And the processing for some types of music really produces a good effect.

02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:10.620
And when you are sitting in an airplane, there's a lot of environmental noise and an environment that is mostly an animal rights violation.

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:16.620
And you have this thing that is overriding some of that. It doesn't need to be extremely high fidelity.

02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:23.620
It just needs to capture your nervous system and produce the right kind of resonance that you're interested in.

02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:27.620
This reminds me of... What was that? Was it R-Bass?

02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:32.620
The program that would produce bass frequencies that could...

02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:38.620
There's some kind of program that people use for small speakers that can't actually produce bass waves.

02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:43.620
Oh yeah, R-Bass, the plugin. Sorry, yeah. It's a waves plugin for audio engineering.

02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:44.620
Shout out to waves.

02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:53.620
But it's basically a way of taking the harmonics that would be produced by the low frequency wave that your speakers can't actually produce

02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.620
and propagating them into the higher range of frequencies.

02:01:56.620 --> 02:02:07.620
And so creating this kind of phantom bass note that you hear the actual bass note by extrapolating where it belongs.

02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:11.620
Saxophones work like this too, for a more analog version.

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:15.620
But you're actually hearing the overtones and your mind extrapolates the fundamental from it.

02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.620
That's fascinating.

02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:26.620
And so it seems like that's what this is doing, which is that the headphones probably understand the kinds of frequencies that are necessary for richness

02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:31.620
because they've studied it enough, they've characterized what creates a rich resonant sound

02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:42.620
and then they're able to tweak the waveform of the song in order to get it to be more in tune with the way that you want to hear it.

02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:50.620
And so what they're doing is they're tuning your brain in relation to the tech that's producing the sound.

02:02:50.620 --> 02:03:04.620
And that kind of gets me onto the next set of topics, which is how technology that we are developing seems escapist to some degree.

02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:13.620
And it seems like instead of addressing that the way that airplanes operate is an animal rights violation,

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:22.620
we produce the technology that allows us to tune out of it and to just accept the world as it is and to just shuffle along until we can get into a different environment.

02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:25.620
Most of nature is an animal rights violation.

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:33.620
Most of the stuff that happens outside of a factory farm is worse than the stuff that happens inside of the factory farm to most conscious beings on the planet.

02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:36.620
I elaborate on that because I don't know that I agree.

02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:45.620
I think this idea of living free in nature is easy to romanticize, but evolution is very unpleasant for most of its participants.

02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:53.620
And I think that life on Earth itself is something that is full of pain and it's undesirable.

02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:57.620
And we have opted out of this for good reasons.

02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:03.620
It's creating a highly artificial and often alienating environment.

02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:13.620
There is an evidence that people feel more fulfilled when you get rid of all the creature comforts and you have to fight for your naked survival because you don't have time for depression.

02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:21.620
And so a lot of the alienation that we experience is the result of, in some sense, being too comfortable for us.

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:25.620
And that we need to escape from this is also something that increases discomfort.

02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:29.620
But there is no easy solution, no easy way out of it.

02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:33.620
It's a peculiarity that we find ourselves in.

02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:37.620
And it's also something that enables the kind of conversation that we have right now.

02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:45.620
This thing that you are sitting in your remote studio and we're having a Zoom conversation while I'm sitting down here in Mendo Park.

02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:50.620
We're talking into our microphones and listening to each other through the headphones.

02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:55.620
You could say there is something escapist to people listening to the effects of that.

02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:57.620
But there's also something valuable to it.

02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:00.620
We produce a cultural artifact that otherwise wouldn't exist.

02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:04.620
There is the wild guess train to meet itself in our conversation.

02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:08.620
And don't be too judgmental about that.

02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:11.620
I'm just curious if you can sell me on this factory farm thing.

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:19.620
Because when I think about the fundamental difference, it's that the animal is able to express its agency in the wild.

02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.620
And it has one bad day where maybe it's shot in the head by a hunter.

02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:28.620
But the animal in the factory farm comes to understand that its freedom is restricted.

02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:33.620
And it suffers its inability to actualize itself on a day-to-day basis.

02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:37.620
And that's what is fundamentally disturbing to me about factory farms.

02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:49.620
There is a Chinese author, Liu Qixin, I probably mispronounced him, who is most famous for The Dark Forest.

02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:59.620
And he wrote a short story, and I hope I don't misattributed him, but I think it was him, where he describes how a few aliens arrive on Earth.

02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:06.620
And they say that they are the last survivors of a planet that has been destroyed by a planet eater.

02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:09.620
The planet eater is something like a spaceship.

02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.620
It's larger than the planet.

02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:18.620
And it is a traveling civilization that basically goes from planet to planet and harvests its biosphere.

02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:24.620
And it's so strong that it's basically impossible to defend yourself against it.

02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:30.620
But humanity has a head start because they meet this fugitive who gives them an advance warning.

02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:33.620
And they build a major fleet and planetary defenses.

02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:39.620
And when the planet eater spaceship arrives, they manage to make a minor dent in it before they are harvested.

02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:45.620
And this gives the planet eater civilization a lot of respect for people.

02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:50.620
And they try to sample them and realize that humans are actually quite decent food species.

02:06:50.620 --> 02:07:01.620
So they get promoted, which means that part of the human civilization is allowed to go on board of this planet eater civilization and permanently live as a food species there,

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:03.620
which means they will be treated exceptionally well.

02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:10.620
It's a very advanced technological civilization, a very good life, at the end of which they will be painlessly killed and eaten.

02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:16.620
And there is this big conflict between the heroes of the story,

02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:22.620
the ones who are building the army to defend Earth and their children, who decide to go on this ship.

02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:30.620
And the children think that their parents are insane to resist because life is objectively so much better as a food species than it was before on Earth.

02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:36.620
Everybody is so much more fulfilled and so much more happy and has so less stress out

02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:40.620
because the aliens are just organizing the best possible experience of life that you could have.

02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:48.620
Factory farms don't organize a good experience, right? By definition, that's the problem.

02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:50.620
But it's just the imperfection that they have, right?

02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:53.620
You could have a factory farm that is producing a better experience.

02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:57.620
And it also makes sense for the factory farm to do this, for some reason, right?

02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:04.620
Because animals that grow up without distress and unnecessary suffering probably grow up more efficiently.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:09.620
Suffering is just friction. It's something that is suboptimal.

02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:12.620
And I believe that in some sense Garden Eden is about this, right?

02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:16.620
The Garden of Eden is this place with lush agricultural production and no screaming,

02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:20.620
which implies it's a factory farm in which everything is fully domesticated.

02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:23.620
Everything is fully submitting to the will of the Creator.

02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:28.620
And that thing that defines us as humans, this food of knowledge, the freedom to defect,

02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:33.620
the freedom to play short games, the freedom to not submit to the divine will

02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:41.620
before we are able to recognize ourselves, is a deviation from this ideal that has been created there.

02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:47.620
And in some sense, our mission as a species is the attempt to create something that's better than Eden,

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:49.620
better than the factory farm.

02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:53.620
And the big hope is that heaven and Eden are not the same thing in the end.

02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:59.620
That we do not just re-lobotomize ourselves to be domesticated again.

02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:08.620
I mean, I think that it's easy for me to reparse your sentence to say more that factory farm could be better than nature.

02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:15.620
And I think there's truth to that because I always think about our cat.

02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:25.620
She definitely prefers the domesticated life to the alternative because she gets her dry food, she gets her wet food.

02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:33.620
She literally spends hours a day just lying around totally comfortable with no concern for anything in the world.

02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:35.620
She bosses us around.

02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:41.620
It's very, very good for her in that context, better than it would be for a wild cat.

02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:44.620
We like to say she's the happiest animal in the world.

02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:46.620
She just sits around for hours a day purring.

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:48.620
It's just unbelievable, actually.

02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:50.620
I wish I could switch places with her several times a day.

02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:56.620
We also think that next lifetime we want to spend one lifetime rest and recreation as our cat.

02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:57.620
Exactly.

02:09:57.620 --> 02:10:13.620
And so I acknowledge that there is a push towards domestication because people have this tendency of looking at modernity and thinking that people in the past made a mistake.

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:22.620
They made some kind of bargain that they shouldn't have made and if they were better informed about the future consequences that they wouldn't have made it.

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:26.620
But then you go back and you look at the way that people used to live and the conditions in which they lived.

02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:32.620
It was always either too cold or too hot or there was not enough food or there was a worrying tribe.

02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:42.620
And so we've progressively given more and more control to structures that we value that relieve us of these terrible pressures of nature.

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:49.620
Like Shiloh and I will go into the woods and there's this river that we go to and it's a beautiful river, absolutely pristine.

02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:54.620
But I look around at the landscape and it's a hard landscape to survive in.

02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.620
You know, there's not a lot of food on it.

02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:58.620
It's very exposed.

02:10:58.620 --> 02:10:59.620
There's not a lot of shade.

02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:04.620
Massive wildfires have come through it over the course of the last 20 years.

02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:08.620
And so it's just this really strained place.

02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:23.620
And I grant you that that really strained condition makes it makes an imperative that wants us to leave nature and to create a contained garden in which things are going to be OK.

02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:41.620
But then you also end up at the fact that that creation of the garden produces psychological distress that manifests as anxiety and neurosis, alienation, depression.

02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:44.620
And my parents are Soviet immigrants.

02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:56.620
They left the Soviet Union and made this incredible step from how awful it was inside the Soviet Union to the West.

02:11:56.620 --> 02:12:05.620
And my dad always tells the story of how when they were leaving, everyone told them that they were going to die, that they were they were abandoning the Soviet Union.

02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:10.620
And it was the biggest mistake that they were ever going to make because the West would destroy them.

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:21.620
And then he went to the grocery store in Israel and would just spend hours browsing through the shelves in awe of the variety.

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:25.620
You know, there's like 15 different types of yogurts.

02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:29.620
Everything is packaged for being tasty and consumable.

02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:42.620
And he really valued that transition from something unpleasant to something really varied and that embodied perhaps you can say the illusion of choice,

02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:47.620
but at least gave him this feeling of my God, there's so many things that I can choose from.

02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:53.620
And that now that he's settled and he's a tech worker and it's been 20 years at the same company,

02:12:53.620 --> 02:13:09.620
I can tell that he has this nostalgic feeling of not having that stepwise increase in quality of life available to him anymore because he's reached arguably the top of the world.

02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:11.620
He can't get any farther.

02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:20.620
And so he's looking around, he's like, everything is good, but it just doesn't have the same quality that it did when I went from bad to good.

02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:27.620
And I think that that's what domestication would lead to unless you start really messing with people's neurotransmitters.

02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:32.620
You're going to end up with people that are domesticated and unhappy.

02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:37.620
That seems to be inherent in our desires to be constantly improving.

02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:40.620
And if you get to paradise, what do you have?

02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:46.620
If I go back to Europe, it feels usually more real to me than the US does.

02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:51.620
And I think that's in part because it has more layers.

02:13:51.620 --> 02:14:00.620
In some sense, many of these layers are obsolete and outdated because the modern capitalist late stage society that is imposed on it,

02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:08.620
that no longer relies on the social regulation that evolved over many centuries and that is mostly absent in the US.

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:17.620
So in some sense, the US is more adapted to constant innovation and constantly reinventing itself than Europe is.

02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:28.620
But the prices that you also have the impression that there is far less steps into everything that seems to be far less substance to most of the interactions that you perceive.

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:35.620
They're more transparent usually and more transactional fields than they have been in Europe.

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:46.620
And I could imagine that this is an aspect of the dissatisfaction that your dad might be experiencing at his current famous employer in the tech industry.

02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:52.620
How interesting are the people that you're interacting with? How meaningful is the stuff that is happening?

02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:59.620
When I grew up in Eastern Germany, the core of our experience was books and ideas and theater.

02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:02.620
Every intellectual was, by definition, a dissident.

02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:09.620
It made for an interesting interaction with other people and to be in a world where most intellectuals are not dissidents,

02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:15.620
but influencers that serve an audience and in between sell products.

02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:22.620
So the YouTube channel flies or do the equivalent that maybe they sell books or something like that.

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.620
It's a very different life to be in.

02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:33.620
So if you are self-identifying or maybe not identifying but functionally are bohemian in the way in which you probably are,

02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:41.620
it's much harder to survive in a capitalist society where the actual nature of survival is so blatantly obvious.

02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:47.620
That's interesting. I'm not sure that my dad is particularly bohemian.

02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:50.620
No, but you are.

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:59.620
We've tried to sidestep this. So far, it's really shocked me, but we're entirely supported by our audience directly.

02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:07.620
We have a huge patron base. Like I was saying before, we have kind of an incredible ratio of patrons to audience.

02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:12.620
We don't have advertisements. We don't have any sponsors. We don't have any institutional affiliations.

02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:13.620
Well, we run ads at the beginning.

02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:19.620
We don't do them, but YouTube will run ads whether or not we monetize them essentially at the beginning of episodes.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:28.620
But in general, I think there is a way out of that if you are able to provide a service directly to the people that are your audience at the end of the day.

02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:29.620
Yeah, I agree.

02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:32.620
I hope it continues to work.

02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:34.620
But I think that it's a choice that you have to make.

02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:43.620
And I think that it is true that the American tendency is to optimize for making money because you see people who have podcasts or they have venues

02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:49.620
and there's just ads splattered over them as a function of the product.

02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:56.620
And it's obvious that the intellectual material is simply a vessel for the ads.

02:16:56.620 --> 02:16:59.620
That's the feeling you get when you read CNN or something.

02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:01.620
Yeah, there's text and yeah, there's some new stuff.

02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:12.620
But what it is is it's a glorified ad board because that's the business model is that they have to sell you something that you'll read so that your eyes will fall upon the advertising.

02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:16.620
Even Google itself has turned into an ad board.

02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:17.620
Yeah, it's incredible.

02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:24.620
The quality of Google search results has just plummeted over the course of the years because the ad board functionality has increased incredibly.

02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:30.620
I think it's possible to get out of that.

02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:34.620
I think that you have to make something that people really want.

02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:43.620
But this is a little bit parallel to what I was saying earlier about the goal and the desire where I think that in Europe,

02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:50.620
there is an older culture that has been molded by war.

02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:59.620
It has been molded by terrible events, things that are really horrific fractures in history that the people have had to deal with

02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:05.620
and reconcile themselves against and learn lessons from in a way that travels from generation to generation.

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:10.620
It also has been molded by the church and by the kings and so by feudalism.

02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:16.620
There has been a structure that has been constructed, that has evolved into some kind of an organism.

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:23.620
And societies have been built into such organisms that had to survive in the competition with each other.

02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:26.620
And the U.S. is a very different country in this regard.

02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:31.620
There were never kings in the U.S. There was never a state church in the U.S.

02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:37.620
It was a bunch of freemasons who built their colony into some kind of new project

02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:43.620
and then had a society that basically was constructed out of clubs that were interacting with each other.

02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:49.620
And at the core of the society is not the king, but the entrepreneur, the one who starts the club.

02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:55.620
That's a really, really apt observation because we've many times on the show encountered the idea

02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:03.620
that America is fundamentally built as a corporation. It's a group of corporations.

02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:07.620
You could say it's voluntary associations. The churches in the U.S. are also important.

02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:10.620
The schools are important. The legal system is important.

02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:16.620
Many of these things are not corporations. A corporation is just one type of club.

02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:20.620
It's a club that is designed to have and be economically sustainable

02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:26.620
and is using a particular part of the legal system to negotiate the rules for that happening.

02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:32.620
How does somebody enter it? How do you take financial care of the people who work for your association full time,

02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:36.620
even after they are leaving it? How do you deal with their medical issues?

02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:40.620
All these things are discussed in this corporate law that has evolved.

02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:48.620
You can even have shared ownership. The public can own shares of your associations.

02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:51.620
It's a very sophisticated kind of organization.

02:19:51.620 --> 02:20:00.620
From some perspective, if you basically drop this lens of our default leftist interpretation of society

02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:03.620
and realize you can be anyone in the society because nobody is stopping us,

02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:08.620
you can decide whether you want to work for someone or have other people working for you.

02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:13.620
It's completely novel. That didn't exist in other types of society before, historically.

02:20:13.620 --> 02:20:21.620
Basically, we dropped this lens of an interpretation that has evolved at Marx times, for instance,

02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:24.620
and we come into the world with completely fresh eyes.

02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:30.620
It's so fascinating that there was never a society where people lived so well as this one.

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:36.620
Everything that's wrong with the U.S. takes this into comparison to how many societies

02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:39.620
with 400 million people are better organized than the U.S.

02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:43.620
It's difficult to get the feedback loops right in the large system.

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:47.620
It's much easier to organize Liechtenstein or Switzerland.

02:20:47.620 --> 02:20:54.620
But for a thing that is so large and is not historically grown but has constructed itself, it's pretty good.

02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:59.620
It's a fascinating project that exists and I'm quite fascinated.

02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:05.620
It's not that I idealize it. It's also in a similar way I'm not idealizing the factory farm by no means.

02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:10.620
I find it abhorrent. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want to have any part of this.

02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:14.620
The only thing that I want to point at is that there are so many types of perspectives,

02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:19.620
so many types of possible minds, so many possible mental states that we could be in ourselves

02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:25.620
where we can transcend our momentary identity and try to take in the possible space of people

02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:30.620
that we could also be or of possible minds that we could also be when we interact with reality.

02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:37.620
That we basically accept the accidentality of how we are subjectively experiencing anything.

02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:44.620
I find it really hopeful that we have been progressing towards more voluntary associations

02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:47.620
as our own country's history has unfolded.

02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:51.620
We've been studying the civil rights movement a lot lately through film.

02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:57.620
And it strikes me that even in the last few years, the majority of our national conflicts

02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:04.620
have centered around the justness of laws which are not voluntary associations,

02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:09.620
which are imposed from without, from beyond.

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:13.620
That's also incidentally part of the core of the constitution of the US.

02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:19.620
The freedom to associate. And the US is at its core a very liberal society.

02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:23.620
And liberty is the concept of freedom from unjustified authority.

02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:28.620
It's really at the core of this. And right now there are big debates about liberty.

02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:31.620
For instance, with respect to topics like vaccination.

02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:34.620
How does this interfere with the liberty of the individual?

02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:40.620
How does the FDA interfere with the liberty of the individual to buy cough medicine?

02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:42.620
It's quite complicated.

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:48.620
And it's a very complex process of negotiation and litigation that is taking place there.

02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:54.620
Well, beyond just the complicated process of litigation and negotiation,

02:22:54.620 --> 02:23:00.620
there's also the question of belief in the legitimacy of the system.

02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:07.620
Where the comment that I was trying to make about corporatism is that in the United States,

02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:10.620
and perhaps this is also the case in Europe, I don't know enough about it,

02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:16.620
but the government seems like it has been largely co-opted by the interests of corporations.

02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:25.620
And the process by which that has happened is legal and social and structural.

02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:27.620
But the end result is the same.

02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:35.620
That the interests of the people are not necessarily what is first and foremost the question of debate.

02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:39.620
It seems that the interest of corporate profits is first.

02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:41.620
Because we've all bought into the system.

02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:46.620
Anybody that has a 401k or owns an index fund is immediately complicit

02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:49.620
in this well-being of the massive corporations.

02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:54.620
And so we are all part of this process by which we agree that,

02:23:54.620 --> 02:24:01.620
okay, we need the corporate system to work because that is the platform on which we build our well-being.

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:07.620
And yet at the same time, we recognize that there's a direct conflict

02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:13.620
between the process of the extractive corporation and the well-being of existence.

02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:15.620
An alignment issue, I would say.

02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:18.620
I would totally agree. We've been talking about this a whole lot,

02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:23.620
about the question of AI alignment as not being a new question.

02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:25.620
We can't align our corporations.

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:29.620
Those are already AIs that are simpler than the one that we're building.

02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:33.620
And so we should be able to align them. It should be relatively straight.

02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:36.620
It's so simple. I thought the same.

02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:38.620
I made the same argument as you did in the past.

02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:43.620
And at some point, I was surprised empirically, why is not every corporation like Enron?

02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:46.620
Why is Enron the exception, not the rule, or Halliburton?

02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:50.620
Why are most corporations more like Amazon?

02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:54.620
And that, for me, is a completely fascinating phenomenon.

02:24:54.620 --> 02:25:01.620
I suspect without Amazon, we would have had difficulty to get to the pandemic relatively unscathed, as we did.

02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:04.620
I don't think that we would have had a pandemic without Amazon.

02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:07.620
You think Amazon is responsible for the pandemic?

02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:14.620
No, no, no. I think that if the same virus had appeared 15, 20 years ago,

02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:17.620
I don't think that we would have had a worldwide lockdown.

02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:23.620
I think that our technological ability created the possibility for our reaction.

02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:27.620
The fact that you could live in your house and you could order everything remotely

02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:29.620
and have your essential workers bring it to you.

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:36.620
The fact that there was basically a small subset of the population that was credited as being essential

02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:39.620
but are generally the lowest tier of our society,

02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:42.620
and everybody else could go home and work on their computers,

02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:49.620
was exclusively the product of our technological advancement that made it so that it was possible.

02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:54.620
Because before Zoom, before remote work, you couldn't have stopped everybody from going into the office.

02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:57.620
The entire world would have collapsed overnight.

02:25:57.620 --> 02:26:04.620
I suspect that if the pandemic would have happened 60, 70 years ago, we would have had efficient lockdowns.

02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:10.620
People would have said, of course, we will not have a single plane coming in from China as of right now.

02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:15.620
And it would not have been anybody saying, oh, but this is racist. You cannot do that.

02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:18.620
There would not have been lots of voices that tried to negotiate about this,

02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:23.620
because government back then wasn't a performance. It was still modernist.

02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:27.620
And right now, we don't have this cohesion in the negotiation anymore.

02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:30.620
And in part, it's because we have increased the degrees of liberty.

02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:35.620
But in part, it's also because we're too big to fail now.

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:41.620
And as a result, we do not feel the need to have tight administration anymore.

02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:46.620
We no longer feel that we can afford to build a society where we enforce rule following.

02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:52.620
You have to deal with a society where 20% of the population are not going to observe your lockdowns.

02:26:52.620 --> 02:27:00.620
And at the same time, you will not be able to mobilize the army against them because that would seem to be excessive.

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:05.620
And so I suspect that in a different time, we probably wouldn't have had the pandemic

02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:09.620
because we would have been able to prevent getting infected.

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:15.620
There's also this other thing that at a different time, we would not have been able to create the virus because we didn't have the technology.

02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:17.620
That's probably true, too.

02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:32.620
But I think that there is a certain structural shift to the way that we react to things that is informed by the technological ability that we have in the background.

02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:43.620
And so if you have something that is a virus that is coming from China and you stop all travel from China after you find out about the virus, it's probably too late.

02:27:43.620 --> 02:27:53.620
The earliest known cases at this point were in maybe March of 2019.

02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:56.620
And so it started much earlier than we realized.

02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:05.620
And so by the time that you get to the point where you're like, hey, the virus is in existence and the virus is in China,

02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:10.620
it's already in the rest of the world because it's been happening for longer than you've realized.

02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:16.620
And so even if you stop flights from China, you don't necessarily prevent the likelihood of transmission

02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:22.620
because the lag between realizing that something is happening and it happening is pretty significant.

02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:28.620
And so as we continue to develop progressively more and more complex technologies,

02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:41.620
I feel like it forces us into a position where there are more universal measures that are taken that are enabled by that technology.

02:28:41.620 --> 02:28:49.620
Like imagine terrible wildfires to the degree that it is impossible to go outside.

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:54.620
And fighting those wildfires is too expensive and too difficult.

02:28:54.620 --> 02:29:01.620
And it is necessary to allow the woods to burn because we recognize that we've been stopping forest fires.

02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:05.620
I don't need to imagine this. I've been living in California for a few years now.

02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:12.620
I'm used to having a bunch of air filters in every room and not being able to go outside for a week in the summer.

02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:18.620
Exactly. And so what if that just becomes the baseline level?

02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:31.620
Like our technology allows us to live in pods and instead of dealing with the environment and managing it the way that is responsible and effective,

02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:41.620
we just turn away from that and allow our technology to encapsulate us into this world that is dissociated from the planet.

02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:44.620
I don't think we had much of a choice about this.

02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:52.620
It was not like nobody knew. We have a shift in the climates right now due to the temperature changes,

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:56.620
which means that a lot of forests are going to turn into desert.

02:29:56.620 --> 02:30:01.620
And so basically you don't have dry forests and tropical zones.

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:05.620
There's rainforests only in tropical zones because the dry forests burn down.

02:30:05.620 --> 02:30:13.620
And so many of the forests in California that are not rainforests are going to turn into stuff that looks more like Arizona or Mexico.

02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:19.620
It is just the way it works. And during this transition, you will need to stay indoors and use air filters.

02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:25.620
And maybe it would have been possible to prevent it, but not just the kind of social organization that we had.

02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:37.620
And I guess the fear that I have is that Apple's new headset is the step in the direction that allows people to completely dissociate from the world

02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:49.620
and allows things to continue along their uncontrolled path because there's a technology that's sufficiently advanced that makes it bearable

02:30:49.620 --> 02:30:54.620
and allows people to continue being productive members of the capitalist class.

02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:58.620
And there's incentive structures at play here, too.

02:30:58.620 --> 02:31:06.620
And I think that played into the pandemic as well, because if you look at the people that benefited from the lockdowns versus the people that suffered under them,

02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:15.620
it was the big players, the big monied corporations largely that benefited from these, the biotech industry, the pharmaceutical industry,

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:23.620
the big box stores that were allowed to remain open while the underbrush of the forests burned down completely.

02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:34.620
And so there's this real mismatch between the overarching structures, these corporate entities that are misaligned in this sense with the common people.

02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:38.620
And that's a really dangerous situation as I see it socially.

02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:54.620
And I have a feeling that when people are really freaked about AI alignment, what they're really freaked out about is the way that the technology is going to be used against the interests of the people who live subject to it.

02:31:54.620 --> 02:32:07.620
Are you able to disengage from your activism for a moment when you do philosophy, or is this something that is your duty to observe?

02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:18.620
And I'm not unsympathetic to the activist position that you're taking, but I suspect when you put on the alien puppets, you're more free, right?

02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:27.620
You can look at the stuff that the chimps are doing on Earth without judging, without being opinionated, because it's just nature playing out.

02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:32.620
There's a species that evolved to burn the oil. It's what they do. We're really good at it.

02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:41.620
And it's probably to the benefit of Gaia. And in the process of doing this, they teach the rocks how to think.

02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:48.620
They have no sand that is almost gotten far enough to sink, and it might create some kind of hyper Gaia.

02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:54.620
And of course, some of the chimps are freaking out about this, and others are super optimistic about it.

02:32:54.620 --> 02:33:06.620
And both of them might be wrong in important ways if they try to judge this thing with respect to their current preferences, because it's very hard to make models of the future from the perspective of these chimps with the limited information that they've got.

02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:10.620
Interval that is changing in many, many dimensions simultaneously.

02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:17.620
For me, it's very hard to commit to a single narrative. When I grew up, two thirds of my world happened inside of books.

02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:23.620
The world outside was very beautiful. I grew up in nature and art, but it was not sufficient to keep me interested.

02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:28.620
I needed more. I needed intellectual stimulation and interaction that I could only find in books.

02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:32.620
Now, two thirds of my reality is inside of connected computers.

02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:37.620
The reality that has been created inside of connected computers is what kept me alive.

02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:40.620
I would have probably killed myself if it wouldn't have existed.

02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:47.620
So it's very hard for me to judge it on a global scale and say this is unnatural and alienating and bad.

02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:52.620
It's also hard for me to embrace it and say this is good and natural and beautiful.

02:33:52.620 --> 02:34:00.620
It's fascinating that we live in this point in history at this particular configuration of the universe and get to observe it.

02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:06.620
And we can also make judgments about it with respect to many, many lenses that we can use.

02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:09.620
I just think it's so limiting if we only use a single one.

02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:16.620
And there's a possibility with the Vision Pro that it's going to create a world that I hate and an aesthetic that I hate.

02:34:16.620 --> 02:34:18.620
And I will probably not use it.

02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:22.620
There's also a possibility that it creates something completely new that I find fascinating.

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:26.620
And I spent a lot of time with friends and having new experiences that I cherish.

02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:31.620
I don't know yet. I'm open to it. I'm interested in what's going to happen.

02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:33.620
Did you watch that?

02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:36.620
I believe in our own agency.

02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:37.620
Yes.

02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:41.620
Let's maximize our own agency. Let's be able to make a choice.

02:34:41.620 --> 02:34:49.620
Maximize our ability to choose what kind of environment we are in and create our own environments to the largest degree possible.

02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:56.620
When we have the choice of being consumers or creators, I always prefer the situation where we can be creators,

02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:01.620
where we can get together with others and build the world that we are in, where we can design our own spaces.

02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:07.620
Did you happen to catch that Netflix documentary, Chimp Empire, by any chance?

02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:08.620
No.

02:35:08.620 --> 02:35:17.620
That's so fascinating. It's basically just following around these chimps in the jungle and watching their dramas play out.

02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:22.620
But I remember that I listened to an interview with the documentarian,

02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:28.620
and he was very adamant about not interfering with the lives of the chimps as they were observing them.

02:35:28.620 --> 02:35:33.620
And I really do struggle with that when I'm out in the woods by myself.

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:41.620
If I see some animal or even a bug that's in trouble, I have this desire to move it out of harm's way.

02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:49.620
And I don't regret that is the thing. I'm not sure that there's any virtue in leaving it to its own devices.

02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:53.620
You're part of nature too. It's okay that you make these choices.

02:35:53.620 --> 02:36:00.620
Right. Exactly. I think there's grave danger in thinking what humans do is somehow outside of nature.

02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:07.620
And you often see that schism in the artificial or synthetic versus natural worlds.

02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:10.620
But is there really a line there?

02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:17.620
Yeah, there is a line. Basically, we have in our society strong norms against torturing others to death.

02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:20.620
And these norms are not ubiquitous in nature.

02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:25.620
I would say that torture isn't necessarily ubiquitous in nature.

02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:27.620
Chimps hurt each other.

02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:30.620
They hurt each other, but torture is different than hurt.

02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:36.620
A lot of animals that die are dying in extremely torturous death.

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:48.620
And when you look at how predators kill their prey, it's not necessarily happening in such a way that it minimizes the pain and bad experiences for the prey involved.

02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:55.620
That's different than torture, which is optimized to create the worst possible experience.

02:36:55.620 --> 02:37:01.620
I think that torture is not something that exists in the animal kingdom. I think that it's something that is a creation of humans.

02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:06.620
Like in torture, you try to keep your subject alive as long as possible to endure maximal suffering.

02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:07.620
Like cats.

02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:19.620
Unfortunately, yes. But even with cats, I don't see it as being an intentional sort of destruction.

02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:24.620
I always think that it's a surprise when the toy breaks.

02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:34.620
Like it's it's just a visceral animal stupidity where I think that she doesn't understand what causes hurt.

02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:36.620
No, I think it's actual joy.

02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:49.620
Yes, I suspect that basically there are sometimes situations where a predator does enjoy inflicting pain on something that doesn't want to be hurt because it's part of this visceral experience.

02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:53.620
It's incompatible with our sheep like domestication.

02:37:53.620 --> 02:38:01.620
So we recoil at the thought of it so hard that we don't want to entertain the possibility that the predator actually enjoys killing and hurting and maiming.

02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:05.620
But we also see this sometimes in humans.

02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:08.620
And I think that humans in this regard are also just a type of animal.

02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:10.620
There are animals which don't enjoy that.

02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:12.620
There are animals which do.

02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:14.620
And a similar thing is happening for humans.

02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:17.620
They're basically humans which do enjoy inflicting pain.

02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:19.620
There are humans which enjoy killing.

02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:25.620
And it's also obvious by that under some circumstances, this would be adaptive given the right environment.

02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:41.620
And so the fact that there are those humans and the fact that the environment does have this moral valence that's attached to it for me makes it impossible to talk about the technology that we're developing without thinking about the morality of it

02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:44.620
and without thinking about the eventual outcomes.

02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:56.620
Because I think that both you and Shiloh are right when you say that there is this gradient between natural and unnatural and there are the things that humans make and we tend to view them as being outside of nature.

02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:10.620
But that's not really a useful way of looking at it because there is the argument that you can make that the burning of fossil fuels and the production of carbon is actually something that the planet needs in order to produce the kind of biome

02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:14.620
that is then able to make megalodons that wander the Earth.

02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:22.620
And so when we make technology, because we are at the point where we can conceptualize the future impacts of that technology,

02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:38.620
it is in our best interests to consider the ways in which that technology can fail us and what it will do to us if it fails in order to push it into the direction where it produces the outcome that seems better to us.

02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:42.620
Because you're right that it's not possible to look into the future and know what the outcome will be.

02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:49.620
But anybody that makes decisions without any consideration for weighing, okay, these are the pros of this decision, these are the cons.

02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:53.620
And then you roll the dice in the hopes that the outcome will be what you want.

02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:58.620
Anybody who doesn't do that is usually screwed by the universe pretty quickly.

02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:05.620
Like there's almost nobody who succeeds just by randomly rolling the dice with just come what may.

02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:21.620
And so when we talk about the impact of new technologies, I think that it's important to recognize that it's possible for them to lead us down the road to the matrix where our brains are the computational subunits of an enormous supercomputer that is the Gaia computer.

02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:30.620
And if we are to domesticate ourselves in that way, how do we mold the technology to not be the factory farm?

02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:42.620
And so I don't know how to differentiate between that and the moral personal quality of it.

02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:44.620
Do you think that it's necessary to you?

02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:46.620
It's a very interesting question.

02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:53.620
There has been a serious sense of anarchy that is trying to deal with the question of how to relate to the corporate state.

02:40:53.620 --> 02:41:02.620
It's an adaptation of Hamlet that is dramatizing the history of Motorcycle Club in California.

02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:07.620
Hells Angels that are picturized in a slightly different version.

02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:11.620
And they are portrayed as a serious anarchist project that is trying to...

02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:12.620
What is this called?

02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:13.620
Sons of Anarchy.

02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:14.620
Sons of Anarchy.

02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:22.620
It basically pictures how they are trying to live a life outside of the legal system, outside of the state,

02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:30.620
outside of the structures of money that comes into the local communities and turns everything into change

02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:35.620
that extracts economic value out of the local communities and sends it somewhere to New York.

02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:39.620
So they try to build their own structures.

02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:50.620
And they fail dramatically because to survive, basically what they do is they sell pornography, prostitution and guns, eventually drugs.

02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:57.620
The negotiation outside of the legal system works via some kind of tribal democracy

02:41:57.620 --> 02:42:02.620
where the different tribes are fighting against each other to fight over territory.

02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:08.620
And their internal negotiations devolve into more and more violence until the whole thing breaks down.

02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:16.620
And so in some sense, it's also a philosophical project that is undertaken in a series where they try to reflect on what's the alternative

02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:24.620
to the organized society that necessarily gets corrupted and captured by the largest economic agents in it.

02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:31.620
And the tentative answer that this thing gets to without being superjudgmental, it mostly looks like explorative,

02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:37.620
is that for the time being, the corporate Kraken is still giving better results.

02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:39.620
There's not really an alternative to it.

02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:46.620
And so basically it takes a reformist perspective rather than the attempt to build something new from scratch.

02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:56.620
And the attempts that we've seen to build something new from scratch, like the non-police zone in Seattle and so on, they all led into disaster very quickly.

02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:03.620
It's very difficult to build something outside of the system or to reboot the system easily.

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:05.620
And we haven't found a good solution for this.

02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:13.620
But if we zoom out of it, it's still chimps doing their best to get the best possible chimps society under the circumstances of evolution,

02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:16.620
game theory, and the variety of human psychology and incentives.

02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:20.620
So this is what we are stuck with in some sense.

02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:28.620
And if we zoom out more, if you look, for instance, into the Miyazaki movies, we have this question of how we relate to Gaia, to life on Earth.

02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:39.620
As for instance, Cematized and Mononoke, where you have this question of whether we should submit to the cycles of life and death and nature

02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:43.620
and conceptualize ourselves as part of nature and submit to it.

02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:50.620
Are we some kind of local tribe that gets killed by nature from time to time or reduced in size or and so on,

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:57.620
and it has to play ball in the larger cycles and accept that there are agents larger than humans that have control over us?

02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:06.620
Or are we going to decapitate this agency in such a way that we can turn nature into a garden and see how far we can go?

02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:12.620
And right now we are in this mode where we have decapitated nature, where we are no longer part of the natural cycles,

02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:15.620
whereas there is nothing there that is allowed to eat us.

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:19.620
And we see how far we can go with this.

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:25.620
And it could be that we cannot sustainably maintain nature as a garden and something else has to take over.

02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:32.620
But there is also, I think, the big hope that the Gaia that we have so much crippled right now and diminished in her efficacy,

02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:38.620
this spirit of life on Earth that is no longer able to rein us in and to control us,

02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:45.620
that it's not only going to not taking over after a major crash in which our population has burned itself out,

02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:53.620
like swarm of locusts had eaten all the available food and then population collapsing and plants slowly were growing.

02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:59.620
It's possible that with AI something else is happening, that we become lucid together with these machines

02:44:59.620 --> 02:45:04.620
that allow us to picture for every action that we are doing what the outcome of this action is,

02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:07.620
so we can no longer escape the responsibilities of our action.

02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:12.620
And AI in some sense leads to the production of some kind of hyper Gaia,

02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:16.620
in which it becomes visible for every choice that you are making,

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:21.620
what the outcome of that choice is for the future of everything that you care about.

02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:31.620
It seems to me that progress in the production of such an idealized hyper Gaia involves repeated collapses,

02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:34.620
experimentations in organizations that fail.

02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:44.620
Even if you look at the origin of our own country, it seems to have been an implosion of the previously existing structures,

02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:49.620
but there was already, it's not like we invented democracy, it's not like we invented the republic.

02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:54.620
We just honed it a little more, but that required a collapse of sorts in order for that to happen.

02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:59.620
Do you think that the future will also be punctuated by these sorts of failures,

02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:06.620
like where the corruptions build up, the captures, the industry captures of the government systems get so disgusting

02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:12.620
that people turn their back on them in order to move past that and actually solve the problem that they don't have to,

02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:15.620
in some sense it's reformist because they're building on the previous structures,

02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:20.620
but they have to actually stop it first in order to keep moving?

02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:26.620
I suspect that there was no such collapse, at least I don't see what that collapse had been in the US.

02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:34.620
There had been some kind of colonial architecture and pioneers that dismantled the neolithic tribal civilization,

02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:41.620
this very low population density, and replaced it with structures that were built based on what existed in Europe.

02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:44.620
But the structures that were built here were never feudalistic,

02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:53.620
so there was never a post feudalist revolution that turned this into a capitalist society in which free citizens existed.

02:46:53.620 --> 02:47:00.620
This was never a society with hereditary castes like existed in the agricultural societies.

02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:06.620
We had an entire cast of slaves when we built this country, right?

02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:12.620
That is very true. I don't think it was ubiquitous, but it was a choice that happened,

02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:18.620
and it was a choice where I think many Europeans said, oh my god, you're doing something that you will come to regret later.

02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:24.620
There was a reason why most of the European countries did not intend to import slaves into Europe.

02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:28.620
And so that is part of the legacy that existed in the US.

02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:34.620
It's also the US from the beginning defined itself as an empire, as an imperialist power,

02:47:34.620 --> 02:47:43.620
that first of all built a modern structure on the subcontinent and was conquering, competing state-like structures

02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:47.620
and had to do this in order to win because otherwise something else would have won.

02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:52.620
And it's something that today is less apparent for most people why you would want to be an empire,

02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:57.620
and why an empire is actually a good thing to have and to be in and to perpetrate.

02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:00.620
It's a very different thing to have.

02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:08.620
And when I grew up in Europe, I was anti-imperialist, and I felt it's wrong to be imperialist because it's a moral violation.

02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:13.620
Now that I am in the US and I realized that all this peace and anti-imperialism in Europe is only possible

02:48:13.620 --> 02:48:20.620
because it existed under the American umbrella, I'm much more concerned about the US becoming anti-imperialist

02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:26.620
because freedom is not something that emerges in the absence of power, but in the balance between powers.

02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:32.620
But you can see how there was a terrible collapse in our country when we moved past the system of slavery.

02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:39.620
It's still quite evident if you make a trip to the Deep South, there was a lot of destruction.

02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:48.620
The way of life for those people was altered in a way that can never be approximated again.

02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:55.620
I wouldn't say that the abolition of slavery led to a crash and to a downfall,

02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:58.620
but I'm not able to judge this very much. I'm not really a historian.

02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:07.620
But my perception of the general narratives were that despite the fears of the anti-abolitionists,

02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:15.620
the former slaves for the most part didn't starve, didn't have a birth life, and the economy didn't crash.

02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:24.620
And quality of life did improve for basically everyone in the course of the abolition of slavery.

02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:28.620
But it cost a lot, right? There was an enormous collapse that happened.

02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:39.620
Literally half the country seceded from the Union and hundreds of thousands of people died on the battlefields in this collapse that happened.

02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:42.620
There was a great civil war. It was extremely bloody.

02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:50.620
And the South had a rough time during the reconstruction of putting themselves back together without that.

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:52.620
It was the war, right?

02:49:52.620 --> 02:50:06.620
I wonder if history is necessarily punctuated by these sorts of tumultuous upheavals

02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:12.620
in order to reconstitute something which is stronger and more well aligned with our humanity.

02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:15.620
This is something that I really don't understand well enough.

02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:22.620
I know several historical narratives with respect to the importance of the abolitionist movement and the war.

02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:27.620
There was an interaction between the two, but it was probably not entirely monoprosal.

02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:31.620
And I suspect that secessions can happen for many reasons.

02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:39.620
And if another secession would happen, yes, I think the military, due to its monopoly on violence, would be able to stop it much faster.

02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:47.620
But back then, the idea that the state should be counterbalanced by local militias made secession much more likely.

02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:56.620
It's still part of the constitution that there is the right to form local militias in some sense, which is reflected in the right to bear arms.

02:50:56.620 --> 02:50:59.620
But the US is no longer serious about it.

02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:11.620
Because there seems to be a consensus that secessionist war is worse than the oppression that exists by a central government that might lead to more corruption.

02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:14.620
It's not a complete consensus.

02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:24.620
There are still people who feel that they should have the right to bear arms against the central government and to secede and to impose their own rule of law outside of the federal consensus.

02:51:24.620 --> 02:51:29.620
But this is something where the majority of the country seems to be opposed against.

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:35.620
But it's a difficult question of how our society is to be constructed.

02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:43.620
It's relatively hard also to make trajectories based on new decisions that somebody has come up with, new philosophies.

02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:49.620
I know a number of people who believe that California should secede, and I know many people who think that would be insanity.

02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:59.620
I see the secession boundaries as not being clearly delineated on a geographic landscape like they were in the last Civil War,

02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:08.620
where we have a population outside of the cities that's very alienated from the population inside the cities.

02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:11.620
And it's about a 50-50 split.

02:52:11.620 --> 02:52:18.620
The electoral map, and granted there's a huge silent group of people who don't vote.

02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:21.620
I think like 50% of people vote in elections.

02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:29.620
But I think that you're right that there's this massive cleavage and it's not unbalanced in the sense of just sheer numbers.

02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:42.620
Yeah, and you're absolutely right that the US military and their drones, a few guys with AR-15s are no match for a drone, let's put it that way.

02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:52.620
But at the same time, you could still imagine a situation where the descent among the masses that were not necessarily geographically isolated,

02:52:52.620 --> 02:53:01.620
but mixed into the population was so strong that you would have some catastrophic collapse of civil life as a result of it,

02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:08.620
which would be necessary if the infractions became so grave to the people that felt disenfranchised by the current structures.

02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:16.620
And I would go so far as to say that the lines of that disenfranchisement will fall along technological adoption.

02:53:16.620 --> 02:53:24.620
Yeah, people out here in the country really hate all this tech stuff, honestly.

02:53:24.620 --> 02:53:27.620
Except for our septic guy, he really likes chat GPT.

02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:28.620
That's true.

02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:36.620
When I grew up in Germany, I grew up in the countryside and I noticed the resentment of the country against the cities.

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:42.620
And because I grew up in the countryside, I could see it not just from the perspective of the cities.

02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:50.620
The Green Party, for instance, was something that strangely never found much traction in the countryside, its green.

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:57.620
And in large part because the Green Party was by its milieu open for fashion.

02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:02.620
And most of them thought that having a car is really stupid, just this first environment.

02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:09.620
And if you need to own a car, it means you have the wrong lifestyle and you should move into the city like them and live the same life as them.

02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:15.620
And if you are living in an area outside of the reach of public transport, we need to change this.

02:54:15.620 --> 02:54:19.620
This notion that public transport only makes sense when you have a certain population density.

02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:27.620
And outside of that population density, it makes more economical sense if you have one or two cars, if you live in the countryside.

02:54:27.620 --> 02:54:33.620
But this is a minor example or the way in which our food is being produced in the countryside.

02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:40.620
There is a discrepancy between the way in which the Green Party saw this and the way in which the farmers who produced the food saw this.

02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:47.620
And so basically farmers, for the most part, never elected the Green Party or were attracted to them.

02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:52.620
They had other concerns. They felt that they had been living in this place for many, many generations.

02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:59.620
And they built a very complex social structure over these generations with very strong interpersonal oversight.

02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:05.620
So it's much more multicellular than the single-celled life in the cities where everybody is in the nutritional substrate.

02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:13.620
And as country life requires much more submission to shared social norms than the city does,

02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:20.620
where the coupling between the individuals despite or because of the higher density of people living is much looser.

02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:26.620
It's the same thing that people caught in an elevator have less interaction with each other.

02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:32.620
So this being together at this close space becomes bearable for them.

02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:35.620
Then it would be in a village where everybody is spaced out,

02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:43.620
but everybody intimately tracks all the interactions of everybody else and builds reputation systems around this that reach over many generations.

02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:47.620
And so this is something that is hard to see from the cities.

02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:55.620
And yet the country is governed from the cities and the food that actually is being needed is produced in the countryside.

02:55:55.620 --> 02:56:03.620
And that is something that basically the cities are being able to appropriate what is being produced in the countryside,

02:56:03.620 --> 02:56:06.620
the colonizing entities that live on the country.

02:56:06.620 --> 02:56:10.620
And they are mostly ruled by producing paper that they shift around.

02:56:10.620 --> 02:56:21.620
And this rule of paper over producing food from the ground is something that is very apparent for the people in the countryside and not so much apparent for the people in the city.

02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:27.620
And part of that in the U.S. is reflected by this notion of the people in the countryside that they want to have arms,

02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:36.620
to have a symbolic boundary against the world of paper that they basically can say, OK, you can push us, but you can only push us so far.

02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:41.620
There is a point at which you're going to break and you'll regret what's going to happen.

02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:43.620
It is this attention that exists in the U.S.

02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:50.620
The media are completely controlled by people who are not in the countryside, but in the cities,

02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:55.620
people who had a very homogenous education and had a very homogenous worldview,

02:56:55.620 --> 02:57:03.620
that have a very homogenous perspective on what's good and bad in the world and for which many of the other people just live and fly over country.

02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:10.620
And these other people are no longer represented in the media or resent the fact that they don't feel their perspectives being presented.

02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:17.620
And this creates enormous tension. And I guess that's normal in all the countries that have urbanization.

02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:24.620
I just think that beyond paper, it's also a technological cleavage,

02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:34.620
because the vision of the technological system that I see is a progressive increase in machine capability

02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:42.620
that functionally dissociates people from the landscape, where you have fully mechanized farms,

02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:51.620
where maybe one or two programmers are running the machines and dealing with all of the software problems.

02:57:51.620 --> 02:57:57.620
And everything that you need to know about agriculture is algorithmically encoded.

02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:00.620
The machines can test the soil as they work it.

02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:05.620
There are sensors in the ground that are perfectly capable of knowing everything that the plants do.

02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:09.620
And you don't need the farmer anymore. You don't need the people that are on the landscape anymore.

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:15.620
So in a city, what now happens is that you have a growth of administration jobs.

02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:20.620
You get situations where you have more administrators than doctors,

02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:24.620
and in some regions more administrators than patients in a hospital.

02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:27.620
And this didn't happen in the agriculture, right?

02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:36.620
It's not that the farms have enormous amount of unionized administrators who are able to extract resources from society.

02:58:36.620 --> 02:58:41.620
But there is a power imbalance between those who wield the paper and those who don't.

02:58:41.620 --> 02:58:50.620
And the resolution of this requires us to think about how technology is going to press on the people

02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:54.620
that are in the country that are not vested in it.

02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:59.620
Because I see a distinct differential between the people who work in tech

02:58:59.620 --> 02:59:02.620
and the way they feel about the technology that they're building,

02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:06.620
versus the people who don't work in tech and are somehow associated with the landscape.

02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:14.620
And with each new development that pushes technology into the forefront,

02:59:14.620 --> 02:59:17.620
into the center of the way that we organize society,

02:59:17.620 --> 02:59:21.620
the people that live on the outskirts feel more and more pressured.

02:59:21.620 --> 02:59:28.620
And I feel like if we're not careful in the way that we develop, deploy this technology,

02:59:28.620 --> 02:59:38.620
that we're going to create a terrible collapse point where it will return to this visceral animalistic struggle

02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:41.620
that the people in the cities aren't going to want.

02:59:41.620 --> 02:59:44.620
Like it's a very real feeling I have living in the countryside.

02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:48.620
Because I think that there's something about living in nature

02:59:48.620 --> 02:59:52.620
that connects you to the place in a fundamental way.

02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:55.620
Like we were in the woods yesterday and I kind of realized that

02:59:55.620 --> 02:59:59.620
there's something about a landscape that breeds nationalism.

02:59:59.620 --> 03:00:04.620
If you live on a beautiful landscape, you associate yourself with it,

03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:10.620
and you become an integrated part of that landscape.

03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:15.620
And to bring in technology that removes you from that landscape feels like a violation

03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:21.620
because the technology can't possibly provide you with the same feeling that you get

03:00:21.620 --> 03:00:25.620
when you plunge into an ice cold, pristine river.

03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:29.620
And the people that live in the country are terrified of losing that,

03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:32.620
and the people that live in the city don't have access to it.

03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:35.620
And so they're like, but the technology will allow us to emulate it,

03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:38.620
and it's going to improve everybody's quality of life.

03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:42.620
I also want to add that it's not just a matter of whether the people

03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:46.620
and the country's revolution would be successful per se,

03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:52.620
but that they could make the country so miserable and so locked down militarily

03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:56.620
that everybody else was so disgusted with the entire affair,

03:00:56.620 --> 03:01:00.620
that the entire government structure was forced into reorganization

03:01:00.620 --> 03:01:04.620
according to the alignment with the population in general.

03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:07.620
The outcome of that would probably be somewhat uncertain,

03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:11.620
because it's difficult to build new governmental structures within a generation

03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:14.620
that work in such a way that people are happy with it.

03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:17.620
I would want to live in the countryside.

03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:20.620
I much prefer being out there in nature.

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.620
It's much more healthy for me and sustainable.

03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:27.620
But I am living in cities due to a need for intellectual stimulation,

03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:29.620
so I need to be in these concentrated places.

03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:31.620
For me, it's a choice.

03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:34.620
And it's not necessarily a choice for most people to be like this.

03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:38.620
I would still have this issue that it feels harder to sustain myself on the countryside,

03:01:38.620 --> 03:01:42.620
but I think I'd keep myself busy and be able to open a restaurant

03:01:42.620 --> 03:01:47.620
or there are a lot of things that you can do there to survive.

03:01:47.620 --> 03:01:49.620
It's just going to be different.

03:01:49.620 --> 03:01:51.620
You have to perform different things.

03:01:51.620 --> 03:01:53.620
But at scale, the same options are not available.

03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:58.620
At scale, most of the employment does exist in few concentrated cities.

03:01:58.620 --> 03:02:02.620
And the outskirts of these cities, urban metro areas.

03:02:02.620 --> 03:02:06.620
And a similar thing happened, for instance, in the Middle Ages

03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:10.620
or at the end of the Middle Ages when the industrialization happened

03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:13.620
and the mechanization of agriculture began.

03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:17.620
And what happened then was that many farmers were forced to move into the city

03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:20.620
to find employment in the new manufactories

03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:23.620
because they were no longer required to work the fields

03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:25.620
because they now had tractors.

03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:30.620
They had lots of machines that were making the work on the farms much, much easier.

03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:34.620
You didn't need that much personal anymore to do that backbreaking labor.

03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:39.620
And after a few generations, people ended up doing far less backbreaking labor.

03:02:39.620 --> 03:02:42.620
Tide labor in the manufacturers was abolished and so on.

03:02:42.620 --> 03:02:45.620
Worker protections were introduced.

03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:49.620
And people had washing machines and cooking utensils and so on

03:02:49.620 --> 03:02:51.620
that made everyday life much, much easier.

03:02:51.620 --> 03:02:55.620
People didn't need to get up at very ugly hours of the night

03:02:55.620 --> 03:03:01.620
and to survive, perform acts that provided the physical risk to them.

03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:05.620
And also the agriculture became much more pleasant to work in

03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:07.620
because of its high degree of mechanization.

03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:13.620
The amount of physical labor that was involved was reduced dramatically.

03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:17.620
And so you could say that there is an enormous loss that happened to many people

03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:22.620
when they had to move from the countryside into the more alienating environment of the cities.

03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:26.620
But the conclusion is not in the moral that there is a resolution to this,

03:03:26.620 --> 03:03:32.620
that there is a way for us to fix this, that there must be a perfect aesthetic for this.

03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:36.620
Yeah, I find it impossible to not have opinions about politics.

03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:40.620
But I also realized that there are often immature

03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:44.620
and I have less agency over them than I have about opinions about politics.

03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:49.620
I have less agency over them than I have about opinions in philosophical domains.

03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:54.620
And I think this makes them inferior as opinions go.

03:03:54.620 --> 03:03:57.620
Because if I have too little agency over these opinions,

03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:03.620
they don't mean very much beyond my own biographical accidents.

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:06.620
Of course, my biography is shaping my opinions.

03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:09.620
The way in which I grew up, my starting point in the world,

03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:13.620
the things that happened to me afterwards are influencing a great deal of what I'm seeing.

03:04:13.620 --> 03:04:16.620
And also what I'm not seeing.

03:04:16.620 --> 03:04:19.620
And so I find whenever I have an opinion about something

03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:23.620
and there are smarter people than me that have very different opinions about this,

03:04:23.620 --> 03:04:27.620
I need to take a step back and realize that there is a possibility space for opinions.

03:04:27.620 --> 03:04:32.620
And am I able to capture this space correctly and accurately?

03:04:32.620 --> 03:04:35.620
And for me, it's much more interesting to open the space

03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:39.620
than to just look at a single opinion and declare this my own.

03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:44.620
Because it basically means that your opinion is making me its own.

03:04:44.620 --> 03:04:46.620
And for political opinions, that's much harder.

03:04:46.620 --> 03:04:50.620
Because if you tell people that there is an alternative to their political opinion,

03:04:50.620 --> 03:04:54.620
they mostly get offended due to the nature of political opinions.

03:04:54.620 --> 03:04:58.620
And so I find these types of discussions unproductive.

03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:02.620
And they also lead to a situation for very little gain.

03:05:02.620 --> 03:05:06.620
You are making a lot of enemies, regardless of what your political opinion is,

03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:09.620
certainly because of the fact that it is going to be different

03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:12.620
from the particular opinion of many other people.

03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:15.620
Alright, so can we completely backflip then

03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:20.620
and get back to what drew us into this conversation in the first place,

03:05:20.620 --> 03:05:26.620
which is the proposed hard problem of consciousness.

03:05:26.620 --> 03:05:31.620
Because I think neither one of us is convinced that there is a hard problem of consciousness.

03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:34.620
Yes, please, let's go into the real topic.

03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:38.620
Let's cut out all the other parts.

03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:45.620
So I think our starting point in this conversation was that you remarked on Twitter, Nastasia,

03:05:45.620 --> 03:05:49.620
that you are confused about the hard problem of consciousness.

03:05:49.620 --> 03:05:57.620
And what confused you is not the usual thing that people wonder why consciousness is so hard and unexplainable.

03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:01.620
But rather to you, it seems to be relatively straightforward to explain,

03:06:01.620 --> 03:06:03.620
and everybody else claims it's hard.

03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:09.620
And nobody else was yet at the same time able to explain to you why it is hard.

03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:15.620
And I was told that you can explain to me why it is hard, so I look forward to it.

03:06:15.620 --> 03:06:19.620
I don't know what you think about Daniel Dennett.

03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:26.620
I have read enough Dennett to feel like he's not a biologist,

03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:36.620
and so I am confused because his posing of the hard problem doesn't seem to have a biological basis.

03:06:36.620 --> 03:06:40.620
Do you think that there's anything wrong in what he writes when he writes Consciousness Explained?

03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:46.620
Can you guys summarize it for me?

03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:49.620
Dennett's position.

03:06:49.620 --> 03:06:52.620
Oh, well, he's a functionalist.

03:06:52.620 --> 03:06:55.620
Pretty much standard.

03:06:55.620 --> 03:06:57.620
He says, good writing.

03:06:57.620 --> 03:07:00.620
I feel there's nothing wrong with what he writes.

03:07:00.620 --> 03:07:06.620
My position might be different from yours because I don't see magical powers that are afforded by biology.

03:07:06.620 --> 03:07:09.620
It's still just function that is provided by biology.

03:07:09.620 --> 03:07:19.620
And I can break down these functions ultimately in state transitions and substrates that form control structure and so on.

03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:22.620
So it's not opening avenues into something new.

03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:27.620
There is basically no magical homunculus that is producing consciousness via biology.

03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:31.620
Biology is just a way to get self-organizing matter.

03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:38.620
So as far as I understand Dennett's argument is that there's no explanation for the experience of experience.

03:07:38.620 --> 03:07:41.620
Is that a sufficiently brief form of it?

03:07:41.620 --> 03:07:46.620
I find that Dennett is one of the few people who doesn't see a hard problem.

03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:50.620
And mostly has to explain why other people see it.

03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:55.620
This might be a similarity, but I suspect that you're not having the same perspective.

03:07:55.620 --> 03:08:00.620
What I found is that Dennett fails to convince a lot of his own students in some sense.

03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:03.620
And I tried to figure out where that is.

03:08:03.620 --> 03:08:11.620
And the best explanation that I've come up with so far is that Dennett actually never explains phenomenal experience.

03:08:11.620 --> 03:08:19.620
And when he discusses qualia, he mostly points at definitional defects in the way in which most philosophers treat qualia

03:08:19.620 --> 03:08:24.620
and then says it's probably something that doesn't really exist in the way in which these people define it.

03:08:24.620 --> 03:08:27.620
So we also don't need to explain it.

03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:33.620
And a lot of people find this unsatisfying because they say that regardless of how you define it,

03:08:33.620 --> 03:08:39.620
it's clearly something that they experience, like qualia being the atoms of phenomenal experience

03:08:39.620 --> 03:08:42.620
or aspects of phenomenal experience or features of phenomenal experience.

03:08:42.620 --> 03:08:45.620
It doesn't really matter how you define it. It's there.

03:08:45.620 --> 03:08:50.620
And please explain it to me because I don't see how an unthinking, unfeeling mechanical universe

03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:55.620
is going to produce this wealth of experience that I'm confronted with.

03:08:55.620 --> 03:09:00.620
Physics does not seem to be able to explain why something is happening to me.

03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:03.620
Why is me here? Why is there experience?

03:09:03.620 --> 03:09:09.620
And this is something that some people feel is poorly addressed by Dennett.

03:09:09.620 --> 03:09:14.620
I mean, there's this philosophical zombie experiment, right?

03:09:14.620 --> 03:09:20.620
Which is that you can have someone who acts and behaves as if they are conscious,

03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:26.620
but there's no internal process of experience that leads them to behave as if they are conscious.

03:09:26.620 --> 03:09:33.620
And so you have a problem where it's possible that everybody that you're surrounded by are not having a conscious experience.

03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:36.620
You're the only one who's having the conscious experience.

03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:42.620
And so we have this hard problem because you have no way of evaluating whether or not that person is having an experience

03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:45.620
or just behaving as if they have an experience.

03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:48.620
So let's see. We have a philosophical zombie in front of us.

03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:53.620
And we are asking this philosophical zombie who in every regard acts like a human being

03:09:53.620 --> 03:09:59.620
because his brain implements all the necessary functionality, just mechanically and not magically.

03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:03.620
Are you conscious? What is the zombie going to respond?

03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:07.620
What do you mean about the fact that the brain reproduces all of the effects?

03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:13.620
The idea of the philosophical zombie is that the philosophical zombie is producing everything

03:10:13.620 --> 03:10:18.620
without giving rise to phenomenal experience, just mechanical.

03:10:18.620 --> 03:10:20.620
Based on the intuition that...

03:10:20.620 --> 03:10:23.620
What does that mean? I don't understand what that means.

03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:29.620
I think the intuition is that phenomenal experience is something that cannot be explained through causal structure, through mechanisms.

03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:33.620
But why do we think that? I don't understand why we possibly think that.

03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:36.620
That's what I mean about not understanding the hard problem of consciousness.

03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:43.620
Because I'm like, look, this is why my definition of life as beginning before the cell is instrumental to eliminating the hard problem of consciousness.

03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:52.620
Because if you have in the most basic cell, which is an embodiment of the state of matter that is life,

03:10:52.620 --> 03:10:57.620
you have a resonant state, which is electromagnetic. It's the redox state.

03:10:57.620 --> 03:11:04.620
And the cell needs to maintain that electrical resonance at a specific set point, because if it does not, it dies.

03:11:04.620 --> 03:11:12.620
And so it is going out into the world and it is constantly controlling where it is in the world relative to its internal state.

03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:21.620
And as you progressively produce more and more complex beings, you get a more and more complex map of the world and a more and more complex internal state.

03:11:21.620 --> 03:11:29.620
And so by the time that you have a thinking, a walking human, you cannot have a walking human without an internal state.

03:11:29.620 --> 03:11:38.620
It's a philosophical thought experiment that requires you to divorce yourself from everything that you know about biology in order to make the claim.

03:11:38.620 --> 03:11:46.620
And I just feel like you can't do that because the biology is inherently what produces the conscious.

03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:52.620
It's the state of matter that produces the consciousness and all of the resonant waves that are inside of it.

03:11:52.620 --> 03:12:01.620
And so if you have the resonant waves in the sufficient complexity of a sufficiently resonant system

03:12:01.620 --> 03:12:09.620
that is interpreting the world relative to itself and to what it wants, how can you have anything except for consciousness?

03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:20.620
You have experience, you have the mapping of expectation to frustration, and it just emerges from the most basic cell.

03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:22.620
How do resonant waves produce consciousness?

03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:23.620
Say it again?

03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:26.620
How do resonant waves produce consciousness?

03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:31.620
OK, so do you know the Qualia Research Institute?

03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:32.620
Yes.

03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:34.620
So what is their work?

03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:42.620
Their work is that they're basically showing that there are harmonic states in the brain that are associated with experience.

03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:50.620
I think that they're mostly trying to use psychedelics for intellectual gain.

03:12:50.620 --> 03:12:52.620
Yeah, but like if you...

03:12:52.620 --> 03:12:54.620
I think it's similar to the question...

03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:57.620
They don't produce causal models of how consciousness is being produced, I think.

03:12:57.620 --> 03:13:04.620
I think that they're not producing causal models, but I think that their experiments show something interesting.

03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:05.620
What were you going to say, Shay?

03:13:05.620 --> 03:13:13.620
I was going to say the question seems akin to asking how do fundamental waves produce music,

03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:18.620
which emerges from all of these individual tones.

03:13:18.620 --> 03:13:25.620
But the same thing with conscious experience is you have the summing of different modules within the neuron-based systems

03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:31.620
that are all aggregating and fighting and resonating with one another, and you get music that comes out of it.

03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:37.620
And you don't see an explanatory problem there?

03:13:37.620 --> 03:13:41.620
No, I mean, I can see a mathematical problem.

03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:45.620
I can see that it would be very, very difficult to mathematize the way that that resonance...

03:13:45.620 --> 03:13:47.620
The thing is math just isn't explanatory.

03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:49.620
It has zero explanatory power by itself.

03:13:49.620 --> 03:13:56.620
You have to have that linguistic conceptualization overlaid on top of mathematics in order to make sense of it.

03:13:56.620 --> 03:13:59.620
Linguistic explanations have no explanatory power.

03:13:59.620 --> 03:14:00.620
This is just words.

03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:01.620
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

03:14:01.620 --> 03:14:03.620
How can you use words to explain anything?

03:14:03.620 --> 03:14:05.620
How can you use math to explain anything?

03:14:05.620 --> 03:14:07.620
You can't write me an equation to explain anything.

03:14:07.620 --> 03:14:10.620
Math can only describe what's happening.

03:14:10.620 --> 03:14:14.620
It cannot tell me what causes the actor to do the thing that it does.

03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:18.620
And it can't even tell me what the actors are using the math.

03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:21.620
The math has to be qualified with linguistic descriptors.

03:14:21.620 --> 03:14:25.620
They're the most powerful symbolism that we've developed as a technology.

03:14:25.620 --> 03:14:29.620
Like, I think that a great example of this is that we don't have...

03:14:29.620 --> 03:14:30.620
Excuse me.

03:14:30.620 --> 03:14:35.620
We don't have an explanation for gravity, but we do have a great description for it.

03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:36.620
So the math is there.

03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:38.620
Or the atom.

03:14:38.620 --> 03:14:39.620
Yeah.

03:14:39.620 --> 03:14:41.620
There's a bunch of explanations for gravity.

03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:45.620
It's just that we have not completely converged on a single one.

03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:51.620
There may be an explanation for gravity that's outside the context of this conversation,

03:14:51.620 --> 03:14:56.620
but the most popular theory of gravity is not an explanation at all.

03:14:56.620 --> 03:15:01.620
It's a description of how objects behave gravitationally with respect to one another.

03:15:01.620 --> 03:15:05.620
Relativism is fundamentally a description of what's happening.

03:15:05.620 --> 03:15:07.620
It's not an explanation of what's happening.

03:15:07.620 --> 03:15:10.620
It doesn't actually tell me what's holding my body to the floor.

03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:14.620
It's just telling me that my body will be held to the floor in this particular fashion.

03:15:15.620 --> 03:15:22.620
There's a theory that describes the evolution of locations in space-time.

03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:25.620
It does describe them, but that doesn't explain anything.

03:15:25.620 --> 03:15:29.620
The nice thing is that it reduces it to something that is much more simple.

03:15:29.620 --> 03:15:34.620
And from this thing that is much more simple, you get your feet being pressed to the floor.

03:15:34.620 --> 03:15:37.620
But it doesn't explain what...

03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:41.620
The mathematics allows you to derive it from something that is simpler.

03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:46.620
And deriving something from something that's simpler, I think, is what qualifies as an explanation.

03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:51.620
It doesn't mean that you still have to deal with this thing that is simpler now.

03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:57.620
Well, you have to deal with what are the physical objects doing to pull my atoms towards the ground.

03:15:57.620 --> 03:16:04.620
And that is something that is completely overlooked when you're reliant upon a purely mathematical conception of the phenomenon,

03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:07.620
because all you can do is look at how it's happening.

03:16:07.620 --> 03:16:10.620
You're not able to tell me the mechanism by which that occurs.

03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:15.620
You're not able to show me the structures of the atom that are capable of pulling on one another.

03:16:15.620 --> 03:16:17.620
And that's what's necessary to make a true physical explanation.

03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:22.620
But let's not do this today, because I think it would completely sidetrack us for a couple of hours.

03:16:22.620 --> 03:16:30.620
But I think that the question of explanation versus description and how do you actually come to understand something

03:16:30.620 --> 03:16:33.620
is central to this question about the hard problem of consciousness.

03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:41.620
Because I'm like, look, if the challenge is that you don't understand how to mathematically encode the various resonance states

03:16:41.620 --> 03:16:47.620
that results in an experience, I will accept that that is difficult.

03:16:47.620 --> 03:16:55.620
But it seems obvious to me, especially with Grossberg's work, that resonance is the foundation of consciousness.

03:16:55.620 --> 03:17:01.620
And that that resonance begins at the cell and progressively becomes a more and more complex wave

03:17:01.620 --> 03:17:03.620
by the time that it gets to a brain.

03:17:03.620 --> 03:17:13.620
And so if you have that as your starting point, then your complex challenge is to figure out the mathematical descriptors

03:17:13.620 --> 03:17:20.620
and the sorts of states that have to go into your model in order to produce the desired outcome.

03:17:20.620 --> 03:17:25.620
But you don't have this thing of like, how can I possibly know if another entity is conscious?

03:17:25.620 --> 03:17:27.620
Because it's like, well, does it have the hardware?

03:17:27.620 --> 03:17:29.620
And if it has the hardware, then your answer is yes.

03:17:29.620 --> 03:17:32.620
If its hardware is broken, then probably not.

03:17:32.620 --> 03:17:39.620
So it seems to me that your confusion is a different one than the disagreement that some people have with Dennett.

03:17:39.620 --> 03:17:44.620
The issue with Dennett is that he does not address phenomenon experience head on, apparently.

03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:46.620
Perhaps he doesn't have a lot of it.

03:17:46.620 --> 03:17:51.620
Maybe he has a fantasia with respect to phenomenon experience and mostly gets conceptual representations

03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:55.620
that for him are completely satisfactorily described linguistically.

03:17:56.620 --> 03:18:00.620
But before we can proceed, I suspect we would need to resolve something else,

03:18:00.620 --> 03:18:04.620
and that is the relationship between language, meaning, and mathematics.

03:18:04.620 --> 03:18:09.620
I don't think that we have a shared understanding there, which makes it very hard for us to proceed.

03:18:09.620 --> 03:18:17.620
So when you talk about harmonic waves producing a phenomenon, for me that's very far from a causal explanation.

03:18:17.620 --> 03:18:23.620
So it's something that is very unsatisfying to me because I cannot build this.

03:18:23.620 --> 03:18:26.620
For me, a causal explanation is something I can make.

03:18:26.620 --> 03:18:31.620
And if you look at the world of the objects around you, the physical world,

03:18:31.620 --> 03:18:35.620
I can make something that looks a lot like this in a computer.

03:18:35.620 --> 03:18:43.620
Every phenomenon that can be specified and that can be described in an experiment, I can recreate this in a computer.

03:18:43.620 --> 03:18:45.620
It might be difficult to scale it up.

03:18:45.620 --> 03:18:52.620
It might be difficult to solve all the puzzles involved to get from quantum effects to relativistic space-time and so on.

03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:55.620
It's one of the big unresolved puzzles so far.

03:18:55.620 --> 03:19:00.620
But a number of people are working on it and think they are very close to having a solution to it.

03:19:00.620 --> 03:19:08.620
This can all be described in a framework where we use finite automata inside of a computer to perform mathematical transitions.

03:19:08.620 --> 03:19:16.620
And what they explain is the causal structure of elements that I get when I decompose the universe into separate objects.

03:19:17.620 --> 03:19:22.620
That is a perspective that I introduce by introducing boundaries between objects in my model.

03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:26.620
And then I'm able to make the universe manageable.

03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:34.620
And so, for instance, I can create boundaries between elementary particles along the atoms

03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:40.620
and say that the atoms are separate objects despite being forces between the atoms that make them not completely separate.

03:19:40.620 --> 03:19:46.620
And there being entanglement in shared states in groups of atoms under certain circumstances and so on.

03:19:46.620 --> 03:19:50.620
It makes it harder to create these boundaries correctly.

03:19:50.620 --> 03:19:59.620
But this is sufficient to get to the next level of abstraction and say, OK, what the molecules afford you and the atoms afford you is mechanisms.

03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:04.620
And using mechanics, you can produce dynamic state transitions in systems and you can build control systems.

03:20:04.620 --> 03:20:09.620
And once you have control systems, you can also build control systems that don't just regulate the present

03:20:09.620 --> 03:20:15.620
but also regulate the future. But in order to regulate the future, they need to represent stuff that isn't there, right?

03:20:15.620 --> 03:20:19.620
That will be there at some level of post-graining, but it's currently not present.

03:20:19.620 --> 03:20:26.620
So you need to have a system that is causally insulating part of your mechanical structure from the present structure of the universe.

03:20:26.620 --> 03:20:28.620
You can use it as a representation, right?

03:20:28.620 --> 03:20:35.620
Your computer is going to represent stuff that is not currently part of its environment that is different from what the universe is doing at the time.

03:20:35.620 --> 03:20:42.620
And the computer is the principle to produce this causal insulation of a representational substrate in the environment.

03:20:42.620 --> 03:20:47.620
So you can represent whatever you want, whatever causal structure and transition you want.

03:20:47.620 --> 03:20:52.620
When I talk about a wave, a wave is a periodic process, right?

03:20:52.620 --> 03:20:57.620
There is something like a circle in time. That's what a wave is or an ellipsis in time.

03:20:57.620 --> 03:21:02.620
And a circle only exists some degree of approximation.

03:21:02.620 --> 03:21:09.620
What you're really looking at is a process that in some sense is repeating itself in some fundamental way,

03:21:09.620 --> 03:21:13.620
whereas there's also variation in it in some fundamental way.

03:21:13.620 --> 03:21:18.620
So something is changing over the different courses of the oscillations in your waves.

03:21:18.620 --> 03:21:23.620
And sometimes there's not much changing when you look at, say, photon progressing.

03:21:23.620 --> 03:21:29.620
You can describe this as a periodic process that can be mathematically formalized as a wave equation.

03:21:29.620 --> 03:21:33.620
And that's why physicists call it a wave under some circumstances.

03:21:33.620 --> 03:21:39.620
But there is not much changing during the evolution of the wave, but the progression of the photon.

03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:41.620
So the photon doesn't decay.

03:21:41.620 --> 03:21:49.620
But if you look at a wave in your brain or a wave on the surface of a pool in your backyard, this one is degrading.

03:21:49.620 --> 03:21:54.620
There is a periodic process going on, but there's also friction going on, dissipation of information.

03:21:54.620 --> 03:22:01.620
So it's only an approximation of a thing happening for a certain amount of time that allows you to characterize it as a periodic process.

03:22:01.620 --> 03:22:06.620
This periodic process can be described as the interaction between molecules, for instance.

03:22:06.620 --> 03:22:15.620
And now when you think about this, how does the interaction between molecules that you can formalize using a wave equation explain consciousness?

03:22:15.620 --> 03:22:18.620
I don't think that you have made a very good job yet.

03:22:18.620 --> 03:22:22.620
I'm still looking at something that looks like a very complicated puzzle.

03:22:22.620 --> 03:22:25.620
OK, so you look at something.

03:22:25.620 --> 03:22:32.620
You said something earlier in the conversation where you said that the job of life is to harvest negentropy.

03:22:32.620 --> 03:22:37.620
So I immediately in the context of a wave think about sonication.

03:22:37.620 --> 03:22:39.620
Have you ever sonicated anything?

03:22:39.620 --> 03:22:40.620
No.

03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:46.620
So a sonicator is an ultrasound probe that you put into a liquid and it breaks things up into smaller parts.

03:22:46.620 --> 03:22:51.620
And so immediately you have that a wave actually can do work on the world.

03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:54.620
And so it's in its most pure and simple form.

03:22:54.620 --> 03:23:00.620
You can use a wave to break matter up into smaller pieces.

03:23:02.620 --> 03:23:06.620
But what the wave actually is, the wave is not an object.

03:23:06.620 --> 03:23:09.620
The wave is a way to think about interaction between molecules.

03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:17.620
What's actually happening is that what you are inducing is a change in the velocity of a bunch of molecules that bump into other molecules.

03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:31.620
And the progression of that movement can be focused in such a way that the intensity of the velocity change is higher in some region that is remote from the emitter.

03:23:31.620 --> 03:23:40.620
And so you take a bunch of emitters and you focus the emission of the velocity changes in such a way that there is a point away from your ultrasound emitter.

03:23:41.620 --> 03:23:50.620
You have a lot more energy focused in one small area where basically the molecules are moving much faster and with more divergence on the objects that you want to break up.

03:23:50.620 --> 03:23:56.620
And you transmit this energy into the object that you want to break up, but still all just moving molecules.

03:23:56.620 --> 03:24:00.620
And I think that it's the same process that's happening inside of the body.

03:24:00.620 --> 03:24:02.620
You're still just moving molecules.

03:24:02.620 --> 03:24:13.620
But they move in a way that is at the end of their path of travel directed and concentrated in such a way that results in action.

03:24:13.620 --> 03:24:26.620
And so if you have that as your most basic form of function, the wave is a thing that happens inside the molecules of the body.

03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:32.620
And that wave starts to happen when you're a bacteria and you are in a soup and you don't have enough food.

03:24:32.620 --> 03:24:36.620
And the way that you operate is through Brownian motion.

03:24:36.620 --> 03:24:43.620
And you spin your flagella until you get a molecule and your flagella starts to spin in a direction where you continue to travel.

03:24:43.620 --> 03:24:49.620
But then you dissociate the molecule and then you spin randomly until you find another one.

03:24:49.620 --> 03:24:52.620
And that way you gradually work your way up the concentration gradient.

03:24:52.620 --> 03:25:02.620
That's the same process by which experience is managed inside of a human body, except for the fact that it's far more complicated.

03:25:02.620 --> 03:25:06.620
What you're still looking at, of course, is the flagella is the robot.

03:25:06.620 --> 03:25:08.620
The cell is a robot in a sense.

03:25:08.620 --> 03:25:16.620
It's all just molecules enacting certain kinds of mechanisms that are producing a desired behavior in an entirely mechanical way.

03:25:16.620 --> 03:25:23.620
And what most people seem to be confused about is that they don't see how a mechanism can have experience.

03:25:23.620 --> 03:25:33.620
Well, it's because the OK, so I personally think that the cell has experience.

03:25:33.620 --> 03:25:39.620
Like, I think that a bacteria, when it is about to die, feels that it is about to die.

03:25:39.620 --> 03:25:40.620
Why?

03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:46.620
Because I think that it experiences redox stress and that's electrical and you can feel electricity.

03:25:46.620 --> 03:25:50.620
But why is there a self in the bacterium?

03:25:50.620 --> 03:26:06.620
So the self is something that requires multiple, like progressively more complex modules that come together that are able to form an external representation of the environment and then relay that onto their place in it.

03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:09.620
So I agree that the self is more complicated than what the bacteria has.

03:26:09.620 --> 03:26:14.620
But I don't think that you have to have a conception of self to have an experience.

03:26:14.620 --> 03:26:16.620
That's the fundamental problem.

03:26:16.620 --> 03:26:18.620
Like, the experience predates the self.

03:26:18.620 --> 03:26:25.620
This is tantamount obvious because animals that don't have a sense of self still have experience.

03:26:25.620 --> 03:26:38.620
And so the idea that the entire theory rests on the emergence of the self out of, like, if you have experience, you must have a self, to me doesn't totally make sense.

03:26:38.620 --> 03:26:42.620
I think you need to have something like an attentional self to be conscious.

03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:46.620
And a personal self is something that is developed later and is much more specific.

03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:51.620
You attribute much more to yourself than the fact that you observe.

03:26:51.620 --> 03:27:03.620
And also, when you are an attentional self, it doesn't mean that you necessarily have a language in which you can reason about the fact that you observe yourself and you're able to conceptualize yourself in any way.

03:27:03.620 --> 03:27:07.620
So you can be an entirely preconceptual agent that still is conscious.

03:27:07.620 --> 03:27:11.620
And the boundary condition of that can probably be seen in dreams.

03:27:11.620 --> 03:27:20.620
They're basically states in which you do not have a notion of a self beyond the fact that you have some kind of reflexive attention, that you observe yourself observing.

03:27:20.620 --> 03:27:35.620
And yet it's not clear to me that the bacterium would necessarily be reflexive in this sense, that it has an attentional self that is singling out features in such a way that it's able to act in a model of its own awareness that would make it conscious.

03:27:35.620 --> 03:27:39.620
And it's not obvious to me that the bacterium would be conscious.

03:27:39.620 --> 03:27:43.620
But I don't think that without consciousness you can have experience.

03:27:43.620 --> 03:27:47.620
I think a person that is unconscious doesn't have experience.

03:27:48.620 --> 03:27:51.620
Do you mean self-awareness by consciousness? Is that what you mean?

03:27:51.620 --> 03:27:54.620
No, I mean awareness of awareness.

03:27:54.620 --> 03:28:03.620
So you can also be not aware of yourself by being conscious, even though typically the awareness of the fact that you're aware is only one step away.

03:28:03.620 --> 03:28:10.620
But you have awareness of content, awareness of the mode of experience and reflexive awareness that usually come together in a conscious system.

03:28:10.620 --> 03:28:16.620
But without this singling out of features that you're attending to, I don't think that you can be conscious.

03:28:16.620 --> 03:28:20.620
That seems to be one of the necessary conditions for consciousness.

03:28:20.620 --> 03:28:25.620
And it's not obvious to me that bacteria have to fulfill this condition to function.

03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:33.620
Well, I think that it's possible that the bacteria don't fulfill the conditions of a human.

03:28:33.620 --> 03:28:36.620
I think that to say that they do would be absurd.

03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:38.620
Yes, but it's not what we are asking for.

03:28:38.620 --> 03:28:49.620
We are asking for in order to be a functioning bacterium, there's a cellular membrane and some metabolism and the ability to self-replicate and to adapt to some degree to environmental circumstances.

03:28:49.620 --> 03:28:58.620
For all these robotic functions, it's not obvious that the bacteria needs to be more conscious than a soccer-playing robot, which is not conscious.

03:28:58.620 --> 03:29:03.620
If you build a robot that plays soccer, the robot is fulfilling a bunch of functions.

03:29:03.620 --> 03:29:05.620
It's going to model its environment.

03:29:05.620 --> 03:29:13.620
It's going to figure out where the ball is, where the other robots are, where the goal is, how to get the ball between yourself and the goal, how to push the ball into the goal and so on.

03:29:13.620 --> 03:29:17.620
So in some functional sense, it's going to have beliefs about the environment.

03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:20.620
It's going to have commitments about the course of actions.

03:29:20.620 --> 03:29:21.620
It's going to have co-directed behavior.

03:29:21.620 --> 03:29:27.620
It's going to have representations about the world with itself inside, but I don't think it experiences anything.

03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:38.620
But I think that the reason that it doesn't experience anything is because it isn't sufficiently complex, the circuit that's inside the soccer-playing robot.

03:29:38.620 --> 03:29:40.620
It's not sufficiently flexible.

03:29:40.620 --> 03:29:41.620
Yeah, that too.

03:29:41.620 --> 03:29:43.620
Do you want to elaborate on that?

03:29:43.620 --> 03:29:52.620
Well, it seems to me that in order to conceptualize, you have to be flexible and imagine something that doesn't already exist.

03:29:52.620 --> 03:29:56.620
And that seems like a difficulty for unconscious entities.

03:29:56.620 --> 03:30:06.620
So the soccer-playing robot never decides to play rugby, but the bacteria that's eating ethanol can then shift to eating plastic.

03:30:06.620 --> 03:30:12.620
I'm not sure if bacteria in general have this much choice.

03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:19.620
I mean, the metabolic flexibility of most bacteria is stunning.

03:30:19.620 --> 03:30:25.620
They're packaged with the ability to eat a shocking number of substrates.

03:30:25.620 --> 03:30:32.620
And so there is a choice where if you have an environment that has a bunch of different chemicals in it, you can choose what you eat.

03:30:32.620 --> 03:30:46.620
The robot, if you teach it to play soccer and you put it in a pen with a bunch of balls, only one of which is a soccer ball, you would have to then program it to pick the soccer ball out and then to play soccer.

03:30:47.620 --> 03:30:55.620
If you wanted it to be a game-playing robot, you would then have to program it to be able to play whatever game you play with whatever form factor ball, right?

03:30:55.620 --> 03:30:59.620
You'd have tennis ball, rugby, high lie, whatever.

03:30:59.620 --> 03:31:09.620
And so in order to get something that even begins to approximate the kind of flexibility of a bacterium, you have to program something that is far more complex than a soccer-playing robot.

03:31:09.620 --> 03:31:18.620
Because to minimize a bacteria to a soccer-playing robot is to erase the magnificent functional complexity that is inside that little package.

03:31:18.620 --> 03:31:28.620
I think you are putting too much into your language that is basically inducing you to have a state that makes you more likely to appreciate magic.

03:31:28.620 --> 03:31:33.620
I think if you take a bacterium and you put it into a novel environment, the bacterium has an experience before.

03:31:33.620 --> 03:31:44.620
If you just pick an arbitrary bacterium from its normal habitat, put it into a completely new environment where it doesn't find the food that it's used to, it dies.

03:31:44.620 --> 03:31:54.620
The reason why so many bacteria survive is because you typically don't just pick one, you pick many, many of which have a potential to thrive and they might evolve quickly.

03:31:54.620 --> 03:32:00.620
Single cell evolution is very quickly, but they need to have a starting point where they can already work with this.

03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:04.620
And many families of bacteria are able to work over a range of environments.

03:32:04.620 --> 03:32:14.620
But I suspect that you can have very different degrees of complexity in the bacterium and there are probably bacteria which are really, really stupid and very non-adaptive.

03:32:14.620 --> 03:32:19.620
And in the same way, you can build a soccer-playing robot that is extremely complex.

03:32:19.620 --> 03:32:25.620
If you think about the complexity of the systems that people are building, the rates of stable diffusion are just two gigabytes.

03:32:25.620 --> 03:32:30.620
And they're the result of training on a few hundred million images and text.

03:32:30.620 --> 03:32:41.620
And they contain all the artistic styles and all celebrities and all the dinosaurs and all the plants and the visual universe that is much larger than the visual universe of a person.

03:32:41.620 --> 03:32:43.620
And it's only two gigabytes.

03:32:43.620 --> 03:32:47.620
And it probably far exceeds the ability of a bacterium to recognize the environment.

03:32:47.620 --> 03:32:53.620
But building two gigabytes into the vision system of a soccer-playing robot doesn't seem to be really daunting.

03:32:53.620 --> 03:33:03.620
So the complexity that you can build into the soccer-playing robot can be very, very large compared to the complexity of what happens effectively in a human brain.

03:33:03.620 --> 03:33:08.620
Of course, emulating the functionality of a group of neurons can be very expensive.

03:33:08.620 --> 03:33:10.620
But how many neurons do you need to run macOS?

03:33:10.620 --> 03:33:14.620
How many brains would you need to run macOS in a stable way?

03:33:14.620 --> 03:33:16.620
Probably not that many.

03:33:16.620 --> 03:33:18.620
I think quite a few.

03:33:18.620 --> 03:33:20.620
Because neurons are not very deterministic.

03:33:20.620 --> 03:33:25.620
You would need to create an enormous amount of redundancy to make this happen and to work out.

03:33:25.620 --> 03:33:30.620
It's basically deterministic structure that you want to build into a brain.

03:33:30.620 --> 03:33:32.620
It's not working all that well.

03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:38.620
You can build a vision system with a slow, mushy brain.

03:33:38.620 --> 03:33:49.620
And still, you would not be able to build in such a way that it's able to, within one week of training, is able to infer the structure of the world from looking at 800 million pictures and captions.

03:33:49.620 --> 03:33:52.620
This is a task that no biological brain can perform.

03:33:52.620 --> 03:34:00.620
But what's interesting is the biological brain can perform the task with much less training.

03:34:00.620 --> 03:34:01.620
Yes.

03:34:01.620 --> 03:34:05.620
It basically suggests that there's a better algorithm than the one that we're currently using.

03:34:05.620 --> 03:34:07.620
Yeah, it's the biological one.

03:34:07.620 --> 03:34:09.620
It's the structure.

03:34:09.620 --> 03:34:20.620
It's the connection of the wetware to itself that integrates the controller with the executor.

03:34:20.620 --> 03:34:26.620
And that's kind of my point where it's like any exercise that attempts to explain consciousness without the physical substrate,

03:34:26.620 --> 03:34:38.620
without recognizing that the physical substrate is mandatory for the effect that we're seeing and is the iterative product of progressive complexity that has been evolving on Earth for the last 4 billion years,

03:34:38.620 --> 03:34:49.620
will fail to produce consciousness because it is inherent in the structural organization of these different modules that resonate with one another to create complexity.

03:34:49.620 --> 03:34:53.620
Because I was thinking about this earlier when you said about, you know, the bacteria is really simple.

03:34:53.620 --> 03:35:05.620
I think you're right, where if we go back to this idea of complex harmonics being the phenomenon of experience, is all these different resonant modes,

03:35:06.620 --> 03:35:12.620
you can think about what it feels like to listen to a sine wave versus what it feels like to listen to a symphony.

03:35:12.620 --> 03:35:24.620
They're the same thing, except the sine wave has been modulated into something far more complex and that complex wave has something else in it.

03:35:25.620 --> 03:35:35.620
I cannot help but feel that when you are describing biology, you are ascribing something to biology that cannot emerge over chemistry.

03:35:35.620 --> 03:35:41.620
Chemistry or chemistry as properties that cannot be explained by physics.

03:35:41.620 --> 03:35:51.620
This is not the perspective that I have. For me, everything ultimately gets resolved into state transitions that can be described qualitatively and quantitatively.

03:35:52.620 --> 03:35:56.620
At no point does magic enter the system.

03:35:56.620 --> 03:36:04.620
The way in which you describe biology, for me, still has to be reproduced by the mechanisms.

03:36:04.620 --> 03:36:10.620
I cannot make this claim. I don't see how you can make that claim.

03:36:10.620 --> 03:36:14.620
I would say that there are bacteria which are very complex in their behavior.

03:36:14.620 --> 03:36:18.620
Like a stentor is basically a little animal that is hunting other animals.

03:36:18.620 --> 03:36:25.620
Yet the behavior of the stentor, which is very complex, is not as complicated as the behavior of the soccer-playing robot.

03:36:25.620 --> 03:36:29.620
The externally observed behavior with respect to the environment.

03:36:29.620 --> 03:36:36.620
The mechanisms of the soccer-playing robot are much simpler because the soccer-playing robot doesn't need to be self-organizing because I can make it.

03:36:36.620 --> 03:36:45.620
There doesn't need to be a second-order system that enables the soccer-playing robot to harvest its own energy in the environment from basic foodstuffs

03:36:46.620 --> 03:36:52.620
and to build its own structure and to repair its own structure after it's been disturbed to self-replicate.

03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:59.620
Imagine a self-replicating soccer robot. That would be a behavior that no soccer-playing robot can perform.

03:36:59.620 --> 03:37:05.620
But just the interaction between the environment and playing a ball into a goal is something that I think no bacterium can do.

03:37:06.620 --> 03:37:11.620
That's an interesting experiment, and I don't know the answer to that.

03:37:11.620 --> 03:37:20.620
But I immediately think that there is something important in that phenomenon which I think you dismiss kind of easily,

03:37:20.620 --> 03:37:25.620
which is the self-regulation and the replication and the evolution.

03:37:25.620 --> 03:37:34.620
Which, when you look at a simple system like a bacterium, it is a seed for the complexity that comes downstream.

03:37:34.620 --> 03:37:38.620
Because you go from bacterium to biofilm.

03:37:38.620 --> 03:37:46.620
And in the biofilm, you have an awareness of the environment because you are responding to the environment in an organized way.

03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:53.620
There's layers in the biofilm that, based off of oxygen penetration, will produce different things.

03:37:53.620 --> 03:37:59.620
Anastasia, I'm not dismissing this. I want to define the self-organization in such a way that I can decide whether it's present in the system.

03:37:59.620 --> 03:38:07.620
When you talk about awareness, I ask you to give me a formal definition of awareness that I can apply to any given system to see whether it's present or not.

03:38:07.620 --> 03:38:12.620
You're just postulating it. You cannot just postulate that the biofilm has awareness of its environment.

03:38:12.620 --> 03:38:18.620
It's possible, in my perspective, that the biofilm produces the observable behavior without having awareness.

03:38:18.620 --> 03:38:21.620
It can just mechanically react to it.

03:38:22.620 --> 03:38:31.620
So, in something that is like the human, if you change...

03:38:31.620 --> 03:38:35.620
Let's say you put a brain scanner on a human.

03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:39.620
And this is where the QRI work is interesting.

03:38:39.620 --> 03:38:45.620
Because there appear to be different states inside the brain that correspond to emotional states.

03:38:45.620 --> 03:38:54.620
And so, if you are unhappy or you're feeling depressed, there's a different brainwave state that is associated with that experience.

03:38:54.620 --> 03:39:01.620
And what you can do is you can modulate that brainwave state and induce a different sensation.

03:39:01.620 --> 03:39:03.620
So, transcranial magnetic stimulation.

03:39:03.620 --> 03:39:12.620
Did you read about that woman who had intractable depression and then they inserted an electromagnetic pacemaker into the brain that cured her depression?

03:39:13.620 --> 03:39:15.620
There are a number of phenomena like this.

03:39:15.620 --> 03:39:27.620
And I think if you look at a computer that is producing a glitch, it's also conceivable that you can build some pacemaker into the computer so the computer no longer produces that glitch.

03:39:27.620 --> 03:39:33.620
It still doesn't explain how the computer is producing the stuff that is not the glitch.

03:39:33.620 --> 03:39:38.620
Maybe you want to explain why is my computer displaying a three-dimensional world, something like Minecraft.

03:39:38.620 --> 03:39:42.620
Why are there colors in Minecraft? Why are there three-dimensional spaces in Minecraft?

03:39:42.620 --> 03:39:52.620
Now I have to come up with a detailed explanation that explains to you how simple circuits, lots of transistors and so on in the computer can be set up in such a way that they produce these phenomena.

03:39:52.620 --> 03:39:59.620
And not only that, you can also stop this and make the computer produce music instead in a completely different environment.

03:39:59.620 --> 03:40:01.620
How is that possible?

03:40:01.620 --> 03:40:05.620
And this is the kind of phenomenon that we want to explain, also with respect to the mind.

03:40:06.620 --> 03:40:11.620
We want to explain how is it possible that you are said it's not sufficient to look at some kind of correlate.

03:40:11.620 --> 03:40:14.620
The correlate itself is not an explanation.

03:40:14.620 --> 03:40:21.620
To say that in many people who are said this is correlated with these and these brainwaves or with this and this EEG pattern.

03:40:21.620 --> 03:40:26.620
And if I build a machine that is changing them, you can sometimes see a change, not always.

03:40:26.620 --> 03:40:27.620
That's not sufficient.

03:40:27.620 --> 03:40:32.620
You want to have a causal explanation. You want to explain what is actually the phenomenon that you are talking about.

03:40:32.620 --> 03:40:34.620
What does sadness mean? What is actually sadness?

03:40:34.620 --> 03:40:43.620
Sadness is an affect that is directed on some source of satisfying a need being permanently removed from your world.

03:40:43.620 --> 03:40:44.620
You can never get it back.

03:40:44.620 --> 03:40:50.620
And it's completely crucial to you. You identified the satisfying yourself through this source of satisfaction.

03:40:50.620 --> 03:40:52.620
And it's gone. It will never come back.

03:40:52.620 --> 03:40:55.620
This is sadness in some sense.

03:40:55.620 --> 03:40:58.620
And a stronger form of sadness is grief.

03:40:58.620 --> 03:41:00.620
It's this paralyzing form of sadness.

03:41:00.620 --> 03:41:06.620
And sadness leads to certain behaviors, mostly a disengagement with the world because you're helpless.

03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:09.620
You cannot do anything about it in supplicative behavior.

03:41:09.620 --> 03:41:16.620
You are appealing to an environment to help you with the situation and to create a solution for a problem for which you're incapable of finding one.

03:41:16.620 --> 03:41:23.620
And so sadness is some complex psychological phenomena that you can formally define.

03:41:23.620 --> 03:41:26.620
And the question is, how is it implemented in the brain?

03:41:27.620 --> 03:41:33.620
And what's also crucial about sadness is that you experience yourself changing as a result of sadness.

03:41:33.620 --> 03:41:36.620
And without this experience, you wouldn't say that somebody is sad.

03:41:36.620 --> 03:41:38.620
You would say somebody acts as if they are sad.

03:41:38.620 --> 03:41:45.620
But there's a difference between acting as if you are sad and actually being sad because that requires an experience of sadness.

03:41:45.620 --> 03:41:48.620
And so we are coming back to this original question.

03:41:48.620 --> 03:41:53.620
How is it possible that a system that is mechanically implemented is actually feeling something?

03:41:53.620 --> 03:41:57.620
And don't say waves that are interacting with each other.

03:41:57.620 --> 03:42:03.620
That sounds like magical thinking to me because it's not adding anything beyond molecules bumping into each other.

03:42:03.620 --> 03:42:05.620
And you're saying more complexity.

03:42:05.620 --> 03:42:09.620
It just means more molecules bumping more complexly into each other.

03:42:09.620 --> 03:42:11.620
It's probably true, right?

03:42:11.620 --> 03:42:13.620
But it's not explaining it.

03:42:13.620 --> 03:42:18.620
It seems like the magical transition for me is the ability to conceptualize.

03:42:18.620 --> 03:42:21.620
And I think that's at the heart of defining intelligence as well.

03:42:21.620 --> 03:42:28.620
The ability to pick out relationships in the world and then pick out relationships between the relationships

03:42:28.620 --> 03:42:33.620
and then orient your being towards whatever you want within that set of confines.

03:42:33.620 --> 03:42:36.620
Can you define this for me, what it means to conceptualize?

03:42:36.620 --> 03:42:37.620
Absolutely.

03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:43.620
So fundamentally, a concept is a relationship between two physical bodies.

03:42:43.620 --> 03:42:46.620
So one is moving towards the other, let's say.

03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:51.620
And then an abstract concept would be taking that motion and relating it to another concept.

03:42:51.620 --> 03:42:54.620
And you can compound these into greater and greater degrees of abstraction

03:42:54.620 --> 03:42:58.620
where you're talking about how to play the stock market or something like that at some point,

03:42:58.620 --> 03:43:04.620
which is a highly abstract, or how to do quantum physics, which is a highly abstract series of concepts.

03:43:04.620 --> 03:43:10.620
But this ability to conceptualize seems to be wholly unique to the biological domain.

03:43:10.620 --> 03:43:14.620
As in, I've never seen a computer conceptualize anything before.

03:43:14.620 --> 03:43:19.620
A visual model is conceptualizing things, or a vision model is also conceptualizing things.

03:43:19.620 --> 03:43:24.620
It's not difficult to build a system that creates a model of relationship between physical objects

03:43:24.620 --> 03:43:29.620
and makes abstractions over them, puts them into some kind of embedding space.

03:43:29.620 --> 03:43:31.620
But can it make a new relationship?

03:43:31.620 --> 03:43:33.620
I've never seen a computer make a new relationship.

03:43:33.620 --> 03:43:38.620
It's never come to me and said, hey, this data set that I'm studying,

03:43:38.620 --> 03:43:43.620
I think there's something happening over here which is interesting and could explain something to us.

03:43:43.620 --> 03:43:47.620
They're not capable of giving that new order of conceptualization.

03:43:47.620 --> 03:43:51.620
They don't put relationships together and give you a new relationship.

03:43:51.620 --> 03:43:54.620
Beyond the bounds of their programming is I think what you're trying to say.

03:43:54.620 --> 03:43:55.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:43:55.620 --> 03:43:57.620
So it means you have never tried chat GPT?

03:43:57.620 --> 03:44:03.620
No, I have, but chat GPT has never ever come up with its own idea for me.

03:44:03.620 --> 03:44:09.620
It just takes my idea, my conceptualization, and elaborates, embellishes, gives me aid with it.

03:44:09.620 --> 03:44:12.620
Same with mid-journey. It's not going to solve my problem for me.

03:44:12.620 --> 03:44:17.620
I have to conceptualize how to trick mid-journey into making the image that I have in my mind.

03:44:17.620 --> 03:44:21.620
But I had it in my mind to begin with, and I've never seen a computer have something in its mind to begin with.

03:44:21.620 --> 03:44:25.620
I think that a great illustration of this point is if you go to mid-journey

03:44:25.620 --> 03:44:34.620
and you're like, make me a YouTube thumbnail for a video about this, it can't really do it.

03:44:34.620 --> 03:44:40.620
And maybe you can say that given enough time and enough training data

03:44:40.620 --> 03:44:46.620
that it would understand a YouTube thumbnail well enough to be able to approximate something

03:44:46.620 --> 03:44:53.620
that is the right amount of tasty that will perform well on YouTube.

03:44:53.620 --> 03:44:56.620
But it's not quite there yet.

03:44:56.620 --> 03:45:02.620
And I think that when it does get there, the only thing that it would be able to do

03:45:02.620 --> 03:45:13.620
is it would be able to make a YouTube thumbnail that maximized the performance of something

03:45:13.620 --> 03:45:20.620
that had already been done, but it's unlikely that it would create a new genre of YouTube thumbnail.

03:45:20.620 --> 03:45:22.620
Because there's genres for these things, right?

03:45:22.620 --> 03:45:27.620
Like there's ideas that people have where it's like, okay, you have to have a face that's looking a certain way,

03:45:27.620 --> 03:45:30.620
and then you have to have some splashy text that looks this way,

03:45:30.620 --> 03:45:35.620
and this is a format that works and people use it, but somebody invented that format at some point.

03:45:35.620 --> 03:45:38.620
And so does the machine invent the format?

03:45:38.620 --> 03:45:44.620
Or can it only take the existing format and just kind of roughly map your instructions

03:45:44.620 --> 03:45:49.620
onto something that it has been as a successful YouTube thumbnail and give you that?

03:45:49.620 --> 03:45:52.620
Yeah, it's our ability to instruct ourselves, which is wholly unique,

03:45:52.620 --> 03:45:55.620
and I don't see any hint of that in the artificial.

03:45:55.620 --> 03:45:59.620
I think the word intelligence is completely inappropriate to describe these machines

03:45:59.620 --> 03:46:03.620
because they don't have that ability to de novo generate concepts.

03:46:06.620 --> 03:46:09.620
Can you create a concept de novo, please?

03:46:09.620 --> 03:46:10.620
Absolutely, yeah.

03:46:10.620 --> 03:46:12.620
But go ahead, tell me something I haven't heard yet.

03:46:12.620 --> 03:46:17.620
I mean, every time that I write a piece of music, I'm stitching together all sorts of new concepts.

03:46:17.620 --> 03:46:20.620
I'm going to use this synthesizer in a way I've never used it before

03:46:20.620 --> 03:46:26.620
to accomplish some goal that I couldn't have imagined before I set this harmonic progression in front of myself.

03:46:26.620 --> 03:46:29.620
I have the same impression when I use Image Generator.

03:46:29.620 --> 03:46:36.620
After Delhi came out, I got access and I spent several days producing hundreds of illustrations

03:46:36.620 --> 03:46:39.620
for the book of imaginary beings by both.

03:46:39.620 --> 03:46:44.620
And I found that it had profound difficulties when it came to chimeras,

03:46:44.620 --> 03:46:48.620
which means it takes a long time, many attempts to get a working chimera.

03:46:48.620 --> 03:46:54.620
And it has to do with the particular kind of mechanism it uses for producing images.

03:46:54.620 --> 03:47:01.620
So when you are producing something like a minotaur, or a centaur is a better example even,

03:47:01.620 --> 03:47:05.620
the issue with centaur, it should have seen a bunch of centaurs.

03:47:05.620 --> 03:47:11.620
And sometimes it gets a centaur, right, like every once in 500 attempts to get a working centaur.

03:47:11.620 --> 03:47:16.620
But mostly it produces parts of horses and humans early on,

03:47:16.620 --> 03:47:21.620
and then converges of human and horse in some configuration.

03:47:21.620 --> 03:47:26.620
Because it doesn't really know how to grow humans and horses together in most of its default training sets.

03:47:26.620 --> 03:47:31.620
So it's very hard for it to end up in this local optimum where you end up as a centaur.

03:47:31.620 --> 03:47:35.620
But it has to do with the particular kind of annealing process that is being used.

03:47:35.620 --> 03:47:40.620
And there are probably better alternatives to this, or you can overcome this with better training,

03:47:40.620 --> 03:47:45.620
or with some iterative process that produces it that you can also build into the model.

03:47:45.620 --> 03:47:49.620
There are other issues that it had, the Delhi version that I've been working with was very bad at counting.

03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:57.620
So if you want to make a dragon with nine heads, it is really very difficult to get something that comes close.

03:47:57.620 --> 03:48:04.620
It is able to count until 2 plus minus 1, or sometimes 3, but then it gets very difficult.

03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:09.620
And these models have gotten better when you now generate pictures with mid-journey.

03:48:09.620 --> 03:48:13.620
Very often the number of fingers is correct. Hands are still somewhat difficult.

03:48:14.620 --> 03:48:15.620
I'm really glad they fixed that.

03:48:15.620 --> 03:48:21.620
A joke when some bot is talking to me in my Twitter DMs or on WhatsApp,

03:48:21.620 --> 03:48:26.620
I ask them to send a picture out of their pretty Japanese face, but of their hands.

03:48:26.620 --> 03:48:28.620
And they typically don't.

03:48:33.620 --> 03:48:39.620
It's in some sense very wild what is happening, but there are new genres emerging after mid-journey came out.

03:48:39.620 --> 03:48:44.620
Like the genre of Kermit the Frog in Space Odyssey and other movies.

03:48:44.620 --> 03:48:47.620
That was for a shorter time a small genre that popped up.

03:48:47.620 --> 03:48:58.620
And now you have the Balenciaga genre on YouTube, and everything as well as the Wes Anderson movie genre on YouTube.

03:48:58.620 --> 03:49:06.620
And of course it gets old fast, but there is something deeper going on with generative AI due to the temporal instability.

03:49:07.620 --> 03:49:13.620
This stuff has not been trained on video so far, none of the released models, but on individual frames.

03:49:13.620 --> 03:49:18.620
And as a result, it's hard to make them temporary stable, which means that if you try to create a movie, they often flicker.

03:49:18.620 --> 03:49:24.620
And every frame is slightly different from a slightly different movie still.

03:49:24.620 --> 03:49:31.620
And this creates something new. It creates a new form of art in which you realize the efforality of the form.

03:49:31.620 --> 03:49:35.620
And what's stable is the concept that is referred to by the prompt.

03:49:35.620 --> 03:49:43.620
We now have an art where the concept itself becomes visible behind the form, because the form is flickering and changing in every frame.

03:49:43.620 --> 03:49:46.620
That's quite fascinating. It didn't exist before.

03:49:46.620 --> 03:49:51.620
And if you wanted to produce it, it was very difficult and expensive to make, and now it falls out for free.

03:49:51.620 --> 03:49:54.620
So there is a new type of art that is possible.

03:49:54.620 --> 03:49:59.620
I also noticed very simple things when you asked Dali to produce an ultrasound of a dragon egg.

03:49:59.620 --> 03:50:03.620
It was not in its training data, and it makes a pretty good job.

03:50:03.620 --> 03:50:11.620
There is something that does require a certain degree of creativity in humans to put all these latent dimensions together.

03:50:11.620 --> 03:50:18.620
Why does this work? I think it works because if you have enough dimensions, and if you cover the space of these latent dimensions of meaning,

03:50:18.620 --> 03:50:23.620
extrapolation and interpolation are the same thing.

03:50:23.620 --> 03:50:32.620
Which means that when we represent meaning, the entire space of meanings can be understood as a high dimensional space

03:50:32.620 --> 03:50:40.620
in which every dimension is a feature dimension, and every point on this dimension is a state that the feature can be in.

03:50:40.620 --> 03:50:48.620
And an object is a range in which configurations of features are compatible to produce that object.

03:50:48.620 --> 03:50:54.620
So you basically get a space of function. Every feature is a function that is varying parameters.

03:50:55.620 --> 03:51:03.620
Or you could say that a function is a configuration of multiple dimensions if it has multiple parameters that changes that function,

03:51:03.620 --> 03:51:05.620
and you can create an entire world from this.

03:51:05.620 --> 03:51:11.620
You could also think about it in a slightly different way when you are creating art with Blender.

03:51:11.620 --> 03:51:16.620
Blender is a 3D program that allows you to make dynamic scenes and arbitrary objects.

03:51:16.620 --> 03:51:23.620
And to some degree of approximation, almost everything that you can visually imagine, you can recreate with Blender.

03:51:23.620 --> 03:51:31.620
And you do this by creating a hierarchical function that starts with a scene, that is the configuration of object that you're looking at.

03:51:31.620 --> 03:51:37.620
And then you have objects within the scene and overall filters that act on the whole scene and produce certain visual effects.

03:51:37.620 --> 03:51:47.620
And some of these objects are going to be light sources that can be directed or undirected and have certain features that are discerning the properties of different light sources and define the functional properties.

03:51:48.620 --> 03:51:52.620
And then you have dynamic objects that are characterized by a skeleton along which movement happens,

03:51:52.620 --> 03:52:00.620
and joints in these skeletons, and skins that are moving along these joints and on the surface of these skeletons with certain properties,

03:52:00.620 --> 03:52:05.620
volumes that can be defined in arbitrary ways with mathematical functions and so on.

03:52:05.620 --> 03:52:16.620
And then textures that are superimposed on these objects, colors that emerge as parts of these textures in interaction with the light sources and reflect the properties of the environment and so on.

03:52:16.620 --> 03:52:21.620
And so you basically create a complex hierarchical function that is producing all these visual effects.

03:52:21.620 --> 03:52:33.620
Your mind is probably doing the same. When you are perceiving things, your mind has some kind of game engine that is trained to track perceptual features in your environment.

03:52:33.620 --> 03:52:38.620
And the present AI systems are doing a relatively good job at doing a similar thing.

03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:43.620
Arguably, they're not doing this by a self-organization, but by some kind of brute force.

03:52:43.620 --> 03:52:47.620
But the causal structure of the models that are being generated is pretty similar.

03:52:47.620 --> 03:52:53.620
And I would lie if I would say that it's not surprising what Dali or Mejwani are generating.

03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:56.620
Very often they're not generating what I have in mind.

03:52:56.620 --> 03:53:03.620
But this would also be true if I was an art director and talked to a minion to produce something for me.

03:53:03.620 --> 03:53:07.620
There are probably many iterations until that gets close to what I have in mind.

03:53:07.620 --> 03:53:10.620
And this mid-journey, the process is not that different.

03:53:10.620 --> 03:53:16.620
And so mid-journey in some sense works like an extremely fast, highly skilled, very autistic artist

03:53:16.620 --> 03:53:24.620
that has seen a lot and is able to combine stuff across many dimensions to produce things that it has never seen and nobody has ever seen.

03:53:24.620 --> 03:53:28.620
I would say that it lacks understanding, though.

03:53:28.620 --> 03:53:34.620
It doesn't have the self-organizing. I think that's the hinge. It doesn't have the generative ability to prompt engineer itself.

03:53:34.620 --> 03:53:37.620
So that is, I think, one prong of this.

03:53:37.620 --> 03:53:42.620
And the other prong of this is the fact that the things that it generates have no meaning for it.

03:53:42.620 --> 03:53:49.620
And when you're trying to deal with the question of consciousness and you're like, what is the experience of seeing red?

03:53:49.620 --> 03:53:59.620
You have to assume that there is a function of red in the evolutionary past that played a role that encodes the way that you perceive it

03:53:59.620 --> 03:54:06.620
that is the echo of the simpler mind that perceived red for the first time.

03:54:06.620 --> 03:54:11.620
And is the progenitor of what will come after.

03:54:11.620 --> 03:54:19.620
I suspect that red by itself doesn't look like anything, in the same way as when you are only looking at the blue sky, you don't see the blueness after a while.

03:54:19.620 --> 03:54:25.620
Red is a property that is shared by the surfaces of red objects.

03:54:25.620 --> 03:54:28.620
And it's distinct from the surfaces of blue objects.

03:54:28.620 --> 03:54:33.620
And the thing that makes it distinct is the relationship that it has to certain objects.

03:54:33.620 --> 03:54:38.620
It's the color of blood, the color of roses and so on. It's the thing that they have in common.

03:54:38.620 --> 03:54:43.620
And that's why I also don't think that the inverted spectrum illusion would work,

03:54:43.620 --> 03:54:51.620
because I don't think that there is any essence of red beyond its relational context of being a surface property of visual objects

03:54:51.620 --> 03:54:55.620
that share this property across lighting circumstances.

03:54:55.620 --> 03:55:02.620
So it's basically an invariance in the world in a space of similar invariance that exists in the same function space.

03:55:02.620 --> 03:55:11.620
And if you transmit this to your model of blender, redness is basically some kind of stationary property of a surface.

03:55:11.620 --> 03:55:14.620
It cannot be rotated into other colors.

03:55:14.620 --> 03:55:20.620
In this way, you have a color space that does not really allow you to do the same rotations as you have in a spatial space

03:55:20.620 --> 03:55:26.620
where you can take an object and rotate it around an angle and it's still somehow the same object.

03:55:26.620 --> 03:55:29.620
This does not really work with colors.

03:55:29.620 --> 03:55:34.620
But you can also have a color space in which you have multiple colors which you shift because you change the lighting

03:55:34.620 --> 03:55:37.620
and thereby perform something similar.

03:55:37.620 --> 03:55:40.620
So there are certain properties and they're all mathematical properties.

03:55:40.620 --> 03:55:49.620
And it turns out that basically color is a polar coordinate representation in your brain with respect to certain relational properties.

03:55:49.620 --> 03:55:58.620
And that's why you can also have synesthesia about color because you can use the same mathematical construct to represent aspects of sound or numbers.

03:55:58.620 --> 03:56:01.620
And if you do this, you can experience them as colors in your mind.

03:56:01.620 --> 03:56:06.620
And so functionally, colors are a particular kind of mathematical object.

03:56:06.620 --> 03:56:09.620
And that still doesn't explain why you experience them.

03:56:09.620 --> 03:56:12.620
But you've experienced them all along the line, right?

03:56:12.620 --> 03:56:18.620
Like if you are the end result of 3.8 billion years of evolution, you've probably seen red before.

03:56:18.620 --> 03:56:20.620
You've probably experienced them because they're useful, right?

03:56:20.620 --> 03:56:24.620
Humans have an extraordinary capacity to distinguish colors compared to other animals.

03:56:24.620 --> 03:56:28.620
But this does not explain how it technically works, right?

03:56:28.620 --> 03:56:33.620
The fact that something is useful doesn't explain how it's actually possible.

03:56:33.620 --> 03:56:39.620
The fact that it's useful for birds to fly does not by itself explain how it's possible for birds to fly.

03:56:39.620 --> 03:56:43.620
Well, there's a neuro-mechanical explanation for the perception of color, right?

03:56:43.620 --> 03:56:50.620
I mean, you have photoreceptors in your eyes that transduce different energies depending on the stimulation they receive.

03:56:50.620 --> 03:56:55.620
And there's a way of integrating all of that signal in the visual cortex and so on and so forth.

03:56:55.620 --> 03:56:58.620
Yeah, but you only understand it if you can rebuild it.

03:56:58.620 --> 03:57:05.620
So, for instance, what I noticed when we built soccer-playing robots and we characterized colors as wavelengths, it didn't really work.

03:57:05.620 --> 03:57:10.620
For instance, there's reflection of the orange ball in the green field.

03:57:10.620 --> 03:57:18.620
And we used very intense primary colors to make the task of color segmentation as easy as possible under very even controlled lighting.

03:57:18.620 --> 03:57:25.620
And it didn't really work even under very even controlled lighting because color is not really a wavelength.

03:57:25.620 --> 03:57:28.620
It's something that is relative to the objects.

03:57:28.620 --> 03:57:39.620
We found that the green field below the ball is more orange than the orange ball above the green field due to the mutual reflection is not green.

03:57:39.620 --> 03:57:47.620
And in order to interpret them properly, we would have to become much more lenient and accommodate the fact that these reflections are happening.

03:57:48.620 --> 03:58:00.620
And so in some sense, orange is what a boat can get away with being when it's an orange ball under the circumstances that it's in its environment, which are variances in lighting and green objects nearby and so on.

03:58:00.620 --> 03:58:16.620
Well, I think that actually strikes at the heart of something really important, which is that the human perceptual framework, the consciousness, is able to differentiate between useful information and not useful information.

03:58:16.620 --> 03:58:22.620
And that's something that you get in when you're using these mid journey prompts where it has a really hard time.

03:58:22.620 --> 03:58:29.620
You can give it weights and you can kind of you can you can control how it gives importance to various things.

03:58:29.620 --> 03:58:32.620
But it's really hard to tune meaning into it.

03:58:32.620 --> 03:58:40.620
Like when you're talking about the fact that it doesn't know how to make a centaur, it's because it doesn't understand anatomy and it doesn't understand what an animal body is and what a human body is.

03:58:40.620 --> 03:58:53.620
I was really struck by its inability to make hands because to me it was a reflection of the fact that it was a machine that didn't understand what it would be like to pick something up and the biomechanics of what of what hands do.

03:58:53.620 --> 03:58:56.620
You know, humans are also horrible at drawing hands.

03:58:56.620 --> 03:58:59.620
Again, no number of artists really struggle doing hands.

03:58:59.620 --> 03:59:01.620
Hands are extremely difficult.

03:59:01.620 --> 03:59:04.620
That's not a big surprise that the AI struggles with doing hands.

03:59:04.620 --> 03:59:07.620
And I would say that the AI is bad at anatomy.

03:59:07.620 --> 03:59:12.620
The mid journey is definitely much better at anatomy than the average human being.

03:59:12.620 --> 03:59:17.620
I think that it is decent at anatomy that is conventional.

03:59:17.620 --> 03:59:27.620
So if you are trying to make something that is a human, there's enough pictures of humans in its in its training data set that it can say, OK, this is the shape of a human.

03:59:27.620 --> 03:59:30.620
I can move that shape because I've seen it enough different shapes.

03:59:31.620 --> 03:59:45.620
But if you ask it for a really weird perspective or you ask it for something that isn't really represented in its training set, it doesn't have a conceptual model of human that it can then put into that really weird foreshortening or into the really weird contorted position.

03:59:45.620 --> 03:59:47.620
That's when you start to get monsters.

03:59:47.620 --> 03:59:48.620
That's what Gary Marcus told me about Dali.

03:59:48.620 --> 03:59:53.620
Then I created people from all sorts of perspectives and unicorns from all sorts of perspectives.

03:59:53.620 --> 03:59:54.620
It's not an issue.

03:59:54.620 --> 03:59:55.620
It's not true.

03:59:55.620 --> 04:00:01.620
It does understand the three dimensional structure of objects and is usually able to represent them better than most people do.

04:00:01.620 --> 04:00:06.620
I think it does understand the structure of three dimensional space due to its training data.

04:00:06.620 --> 04:00:11.620
And that's why you can also take these models and tune them to produce three dimensional objects as an output.

04:00:11.620 --> 04:00:19.620
This is a conversation that I feel like would be best had with a portal with mid journey in it where we could like try different prompts as we do it.

04:00:19.620 --> 04:00:27.620
I also don't think that's actually the problem that you're having because the interesting thing is I don't believe that mid journey is experiencing any of that.

04:00:27.620 --> 04:00:29.620
I would agree.

04:00:29.620 --> 04:00:35.620
The interesting question is what is missing to make this experience something?

04:00:35.620 --> 04:00:39.620
The fact that it's coming from somewhere and going somewhere.

04:00:39.620 --> 04:00:44.620
I don't know how you can dismiss that.

04:00:44.620 --> 04:00:46.620
That is what life is.

04:00:47.620 --> 04:00:48.620
And consciousness.

04:00:48.620 --> 04:00:49.620
Okay.

04:00:49.620 --> 04:00:56.620
Do we agree, all three of us sitting here, that consciousness is a property of life?

04:00:56.620 --> 04:00:57.620
No.

04:00:57.620 --> 04:00:58.620
No.

04:00:58.620 --> 04:00:59.620
No.

04:00:59.620 --> 04:01:02.620
What else is conscious?

04:01:02.620 --> 04:01:08.620
It's the ability of a system to experience itself observing.

04:01:08.620 --> 04:01:11.620
It's basically an awareness of your own awareness.

04:01:11.620 --> 04:01:14.620
What else can do that except for life?

04:01:14.620 --> 04:01:17.620
At the moment, it's only some living systems that can do it.

04:01:17.620 --> 04:01:21.620
Possibly, but we don't know there's some AI systems.

04:01:21.620 --> 04:01:25.620
What is the evidence for AI systems being able to do it?

04:01:25.620 --> 04:01:30.620
That they're able to report about the features of it.

04:01:30.620 --> 04:01:34.620
After they've been trained on literature that contains stories about AI futures?

04:01:34.620 --> 04:01:36.620
That is one of the problems.

04:01:36.620 --> 04:01:41.620
We have difficulty to discern to which degree the AI system is able to do something

04:01:41.620 --> 04:01:44.620
because it has seen this in the text.

04:01:44.620 --> 04:01:51.620
On the other hand, it's hard to say how that is different from the causal structure that is being implemented.

04:01:51.620 --> 04:01:55.620
If you think, for instance, reasoning, can an AI system reason?

04:01:55.620 --> 04:01:58.620
It's somewhat related to the question, can a person reason?

04:01:58.620 --> 04:02:00.620
Can a human being reason?

04:02:00.620 --> 04:02:03.620
We have an intuition about how reasoning works.

04:02:03.620 --> 04:02:06.620
This intuition is not completely nonsensical.

04:02:06.620 --> 04:02:08.620
It's also not perfect.

04:02:08.620 --> 04:02:12.620
Aristotle tries to systematize it and really writes it all down.

04:02:12.620 --> 04:02:14.620
He gets only 80% correct.

04:02:14.620 --> 04:02:18.620
He tries to systematize over pseudoscience and how to do reasoning properly.

04:02:18.620 --> 04:02:24.620
Then later on, there are people like Tarski and Frege and so on who really reason about reasoning

04:02:24.620 --> 04:02:27.620
and come up with a formal theory of reasoning that is way better.

04:02:27.620 --> 04:02:30.620
The people that are reasoning professionally today for a living,

04:02:30.620 --> 04:02:34.620
they basically read stuff that is derived from this.

04:02:34.620 --> 04:02:39.620
It's not derived by them just sitting there and thinking about how their own reasoning works

04:02:39.620 --> 04:02:41.620
and figuring it out magically.

04:02:41.620 --> 04:02:44.620
In some sense, people to some degree are language models

04:02:44.620 --> 04:02:47.620
that build causal structure influenced by text that they read

04:02:47.620 --> 04:02:52.620
and trying to map this causal structure onto other texts that they've read until it clicks.

04:02:52.620 --> 04:02:59.620
I would agree with that because I always think about the Romanian orphanage example

04:02:59.620 --> 04:03:05.620
where if you have children that are completely abandoned by the society,

04:03:05.620 --> 04:03:08.620
they don't grow up normal.

04:03:08.620 --> 04:03:15.620
There's something about the system that needs both touch and emotional connection

04:03:15.620 --> 04:03:23.620
and intellectual stimulation in order to form what we define as being a person that fits into society.

04:03:23.620 --> 04:03:26.620
I still think that they're probably conscious.

04:03:26.620 --> 04:03:32.620
They're just not able to make the same sort of cognitive leaps and developments.

04:03:32.620 --> 04:03:35.620
I'm also convinced that cats are conscious.

04:03:35.620 --> 04:03:40.620
It's something that you can in some sense verify by going into some kind of feedback loop with the cat.

04:03:40.620 --> 04:03:46.620
You basically have a mutual awareness of the awareness of the other.

04:03:46.620 --> 04:03:51.620
Doesn't that obviate the example of the philosophical zombie?

04:03:51.620 --> 04:03:56.620
Sometimes you can just go into a loop with the zombie to confirm the fact that they are having experience

04:03:56.620 --> 04:04:01.620
even if you can't cut them open to see that they have a brain or put a machine on them.

04:04:01.620 --> 04:04:06.620
This points to a very interesting aspect of the discussion about the heart problem.

04:04:06.620 --> 04:04:09.620
It's essentialism versus functionalism.

04:04:09.620 --> 04:04:14.620
Essentialism is the position that something is just intrinsically in a particular way

04:04:14.620 --> 04:04:18.620
without realizing some kind of function.

04:04:18.620 --> 04:04:25.620
A lot of philosophers who feel that consciousness cannot be explained as the result of some kind of causal interaction

04:04:25.620 --> 04:04:33.620
of non-conscious physical phenomena, they suspect that consciousness needs to be made fundamental.

04:04:33.620 --> 04:04:39.620
If consciousness is a fundamental property of matter, then you end up with a version of panpsychism.

04:04:39.620 --> 04:04:43.620
The drawback of panpsychism is that it does not explain how consciousness comes about

04:04:43.620 --> 04:04:47.620
because it's an answer of the fact that you cannot explain it and thereby say it's irreducible.

04:04:47.620 --> 04:04:50.620
It's just an essential property of something.

04:04:50.620 --> 04:04:56.620
When you say that consciousness is a property of biology, it sounds a little bit like this to me.

04:04:56.620 --> 04:05:01.620
I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but it could be that you are stating that it's an essential property

04:05:01.620 --> 04:05:07.620
that is just emerging in biological systems as a result of them being biological systems.

04:05:07.620 --> 04:05:15.620
In order to be a cell that survives, you have to have a way of integrating information

04:05:15.620 --> 04:05:22.620
about your environment relative to your internal state in such a way that you can bring the two into alignment.

04:05:22.620 --> 04:05:28.620
You can call it a thermostat, but I think that that's probably a dismissive way of treating it

04:05:28.620 --> 04:05:32.620
because it's the world's most complicated thermostat.

04:05:32.620 --> 04:05:35.620
You're right that if you put it into the wrong conditions, it will die,

04:05:35.620 --> 04:05:41.620
but it's also a thermostat that if the conditions change slowly enough, it will adapt to the new conditions.

04:05:42.620 --> 04:05:47.620
It will become not a thermostat purely, it will become a thermostat and something else.

04:05:47.620 --> 04:05:49.620
A thermostat can't do that.

04:05:49.620 --> 04:05:58.620
There is a structural mechanical event that happens in the bacteria

04:05:58.620 --> 04:06:06.620
that is the absolute simplest form of what we ascribe as being consciousness.

04:06:06.620 --> 04:06:09.620
Our consciousness is not the consciousness of bacteria.

04:06:09.620 --> 04:06:13.620
I don't think that rocks are conscious, I don't think that atoms are conscious,

04:06:13.620 --> 04:06:18.620
but I do think that by the time that you get to a cell, there is this goal directedness

04:06:18.620 --> 04:06:26.620
where there is a future that you are working towards and that simplest future for bacteria is I want to survive.

04:06:26.620 --> 04:06:30.620
It's not written out in natural language of I want to survive,

04:06:30.620 --> 04:06:35.620
it's programmed to survive and then to turn into something that will survive when the situation changes.

04:06:36.620 --> 04:06:40.620
When you have a long enough chain of those situations changing,

04:06:40.620 --> 04:06:46.620
you have organisms that emerge that are able to specialize to different conditions.

04:06:46.620 --> 04:06:53.620
As you change your organization and make it more complex so that you're able to look at stuff from more perspectives at once,

04:06:53.620 --> 04:06:57.620
you start to build progressively more complicated systems

04:06:57.620 --> 04:07:01.620
and those more complicated systems have more complex consciousness.

04:07:01.620 --> 04:07:05.620
At some point you get to the realization that,

04:07:05.620 --> 04:07:13.620
oh, hold on a second, there's me and I am a stable self and I can change who I am.

04:07:13.620 --> 04:07:20.620
That's a crazy step, but I don't think that it's a step that's magical.

04:07:20.620 --> 04:07:25.620
I think that it's a step that is the result of progressively more and more complex modules

04:07:25.620 --> 04:07:30.620
that are able to perform the computational task of holding all of these concepts

04:07:30.620 --> 04:07:37.620
in a stable state relative to one another for long enough for you to be able to look at them and consider them

04:07:37.620 --> 04:07:42.620
and then after you've considered them to decide what you want to do next.

04:07:43.620 --> 04:07:46.620
The bacteria might not be able to change itself,

04:07:46.620 --> 04:07:51.620
but it might be able to move a piece of dirt out of the way to get somewhere that it wants to get to.

04:07:51.620 --> 04:07:55.620
It's not conscious. That's something that the soccer-playing robot can also do

04:07:55.620 --> 04:07:59.620
that they don't want to ascribe consciousness to without being forced to.

04:07:59.620 --> 04:08:06.620
I feel that you are much more reluctant to ascribe consciousness to the soccer-playing robot than you are to the cell,

04:08:06.620 --> 04:08:10.620
despite the cell probably being dumber than the soccer-playing robot.

04:08:10.620 --> 04:08:13.620
It's the evolution that's important.

04:08:13.620 --> 04:08:21.620
I don't see how the process that generates a certain thing is defining its functional properties qualitatively.

04:08:21.620 --> 04:08:27.620
If you are evolving the soccer-playing robot and it's the same soccer-playing robot, it doesn't change anything.

04:08:27.620 --> 04:08:33.620
It only matters what it is embodying at this time when you look at it.

04:08:33.620 --> 04:08:40.620
I think that's not how I see consciousness, because I see consciousness as something that is across time.

04:08:40.620 --> 04:08:49.620
It could also be that your issue with the communication about the heart problem is that you have a non-standard definition of consciousness

04:08:49.620 --> 04:08:52.620
that is meaning something completely different.

04:08:53.620 --> 04:08:57.620
For most people that talk about consciousness, it's about the feeling of what it's like.

04:08:57.620 --> 04:09:03.620
This feeling of what it's like, there are some philosophers which believe that it comes in degrees.

04:09:03.620 --> 04:09:06.620
There are certain ways in which you can have a feeling of what it's like.

04:09:06.620 --> 04:09:10.620
They're qualitatively different from each other, and maybe there are some degrees.

04:09:10.620 --> 04:09:17.620
But you could also say that it has a continuous way in which you can become more or less conscious.

04:09:17.620 --> 04:09:22.620
But I'm not in the camp that thinks that this is the right interpretation.

04:09:22.620 --> 04:09:25.620
I think that consciousness is qualitative.

04:09:25.620 --> 04:09:30.620
I think that there is basically a disruption between conscious and not conscious,

04:09:30.620 --> 04:09:35.620
and there is some area in between where it becomes online and very only approximately conscious.

04:09:35.620 --> 04:09:41.620
But there are no systems that are persistently in a state of only being approximately vaguely conscious.

04:09:41.620 --> 04:09:48.620
It's only during this transition that there is some kind of coherence formation that happens between sleeping and waking,

04:09:48.620 --> 04:09:53.620
or waking up into a dream vis-en-sleep or out of a dream.

04:09:53.620 --> 04:10:00.620
This movement inside of a conscious state or outside of a conscious state is a qualitative difference.

04:10:00.620 --> 04:10:07.620
The criterion between them is that outside of a conscious state there is no feeling of what it's like.

04:10:08.620 --> 04:10:15.620
If you fall unconscious because maybe you faint, in this state you don't know what it's like to have fainted.

04:10:15.620 --> 04:10:17.620
You wake up and you don't realize what happened.

04:10:17.620 --> 04:10:24.620
You have no memory trace of that state, and there's probably nothing that your mind went to in the meantime.

04:10:24.620 --> 04:10:28.620
It was conscious about something else and just did not bring the memory along.

04:10:28.620 --> 04:10:32.620
You were just not conscious for all practical means and purposes.

04:10:33.620 --> 04:10:38.620
I think that consciousness is a qualitative property that is not like fatness.

04:10:38.620 --> 04:10:44.620
You could say that fatness is something that's very gradual, and you could also say that bacteria can sometimes be fat,

04:10:44.620 --> 04:10:47.620
but if they're fat, they're fat in a very different way than humans are.

04:10:47.620 --> 04:10:51.620
In a sense it makes sense, but I don't think that consciousness is like fatness.

04:10:51.620 --> 04:10:56.620
I don't think that bacteria are conscious. It's possible and conceivable that they are,

04:10:56.620 --> 04:11:03.620
but it would require that they have a very particular functional mechanism that would enable the bacterium to feel what it's like.

04:11:03.620 --> 04:11:07.620
And if the bacterium doesn't have that, I would say it's not conscious.

04:11:07.620 --> 04:11:12.620
It's just the way in which I would use the word. Can we agree on this usage of the word?

04:11:13.620 --> 04:11:22.620
I think that the fundamental difference between the robot and the real soccer player is that the real soccer player could decide to just quit and do MMA instead.

04:11:23.620 --> 04:11:26.620
You can build a robot like that. That's not the big problem.

04:11:26.620 --> 04:11:33.620
That decides to take on a completely different task, but by its own it just decides that?

04:11:33.620 --> 04:11:36.620
Yes. You give it a larger reward function.

04:11:36.620 --> 04:11:40.620
You give it some kind of polythematic reward function in a similar way as we do.

04:11:40.620 --> 04:11:42.620
But you have to do that.

04:11:42.620 --> 04:11:46.620
Yes, but we can give it this. You are born with this reward function to a large degree.

04:11:46.620 --> 04:11:49.620
Some part of it comes online during later stages in your life,

04:11:49.620 --> 04:11:53.620
but for the most part your reward function is built into you by your organism.

04:11:53.620 --> 04:11:59.620
So your mind is subject to some functions that are imposed on it by the organism,

04:11:59.620 --> 04:12:07.620
and your personal self is subject to the expression of these motivational urges by your outside mind that makes you do stuff.

04:12:07.620 --> 04:12:16.620
And the way this is functionally implemented or the way in which you can abstract it is that there is some kind of multidimensional reward function

04:12:16.620 --> 04:12:22.620
that tells you in a given situation, in a given context, this is the value of a kiss, this is the value of a sandwich,

04:12:22.620 --> 04:12:25.620
this is the value of getting the ball and the goal.

04:12:25.620 --> 04:12:31.620
And if that changes, you might give up the plan on getting the ball into the goal and choose a completely different game to play,

04:12:31.620 --> 04:12:35.620
because you feel that this other game is giving you better rewards,

04:12:35.620 --> 04:12:39.620
which does require you to be able to have a meta game that you are playing.

04:12:39.620 --> 04:12:45.620
So if you have a soccer-playing robot that only is playing the single game and cannot conceptualize anything outside of it,

04:12:45.620 --> 04:12:48.620
then of course it will not be able to make that decision.

04:12:48.620 --> 04:12:58.620
But if the robot is thinking of itself as an agent that can play soccer or look for a sandwich or look for a kiss, as you might,

04:12:58.620 --> 04:13:04.620
then you have a much larger area in which you are going to optimize your expected rewards.

04:13:04.620 --> 04:13:08.620
But it's not a soccer-playing robot anymore, it's a human being essentially.

04:13:08.620 --> 04:13:13.620
You've just rebuilt life at that point.

04:13:13.620 --> 04:13:16.620
But we are not necessarily at consciousness yet.

04:13:16.620 --> 04:13:21.620
So what I described, this functionality is still a robot that is just playing a different game.

04:13:21.620 --> 04:13:28.620
But we have not arrived yet at a system, despite producing all sorts of functionality that you would only expect a human to be capable of.

04:13:28.620 --> 04:13:36.620
And you can even conceive of a system that is able to produce coherent sentences and interact with you in all sorts of ways without being conscious.

04:13:36.620 --> 04:13:39.620
So there is this big question for a lot of people,

04:13:39.620 --> 04:13:50.620
what is the difference between this universal robot that is pursuing the same goals as a human being and that has the same degrees of flexibility as a human being and pursuing them

04:13:50.620 --> 04:14:01.620
and can make decisions over them in a functional way in the sense that it commits to different goals at different times based on reasons that are built into neural networks and reasoning mechanisms

04:14:01.620 --> 04:14:09.620
that it's able to report and self-report about all these things, and yet there is nothing what it's like to be that robot.

04:14:09.620 --> 04:14:12.620
This is the hard problem. What is that difference?

04:14:12.620 --> 04:14:19.620
But if it has the ability to integrate all of these motivations, isn't that what experience is ultimately?

04:14:19.620 --> 04:14:20.620
No.

04:14:20.620 --> 04:14:22.620
Yeah, like why are you so sure that it's not conscious at that point?

04:14:22.620 --> 04:14:28.620
Because I think there is no reason for that system to say, but I feel this.

04:14:28.620 --> 04:14:37.620
Isn't the desire, isn't that decision to go and do MMA instead of soccer predicated on feelings?

04:14:37.620 --> 04:14:48.620
No, you could simply say there is a 0.2 higher utility in making a sandwich rather than continuing to play soccer. So I'm going to do that.

04:14:48.620 --> 04:14:56.620
But it might not be higher utility. It might actually be a terrible idea to go and do MMA if you're the best soccer player in the world, but you just want to do it because you love MMA.

04:14:56.620 --> 04:15:04.620
Oh, that's a great point. Humans don't perform along these sorts of utility functions.

04:15:04.620 --> 04:15:09.620
Somebody can do something that doesn't maximize utility. They do it all the time.

04:15:09.620 --> 04:15:20.620
I think that is a complicated philosophical decision because there is usually a reason that you find something more meaningful and important to do something when you do it.

04:15:20.620 --> 04:15:30.620
Or it's a compulsion, which means you realize you have a long game, but you are unable to play it because some mechanism in your brain is overriding it and you're forced to follow an impulse to play a shorter game.

04:15:30.620 --> 04:15:39.620
But when you find something meaningful, it means that you can also describe it or somebody could describe it as a utility function.

04:15:39.620 --> 04:15:49.620
So, for instance, if your meaning is to serve God, it means that you are projecting some higher level agent that you're part of in a similar way as a cell as part of an organism.

04:15:49.620 --> 04:16:02.620
And you're serving that transcendental agency. And that creates meaning that is more important than your individual existence because you don't conceptualize yourself as the top root note of the universe, but just as a cell that is serving some larger organism.

04:16:02.620 --> 04:16:09.620
And you can try to figure out the relevance of that with respect to getting a sandwich instead.

04:16:09.620 --> 04:16:15.620
And suddenly getting the sandwich is instrumental to serving this higher meaning to some degree.

04:16:15.620 --> 04:16:28.620
I think that we've kind of stumbled onto something important here, which is that the complexity of the utility function and the ability to have multiple competing short term and long term goals.

04:16:28.620 --> 04:16:44.620
And this freedom of space in which to decide the way in which you will chain those actions together in order to achieve a goal that you have decided is utilitarian is the thing that you would then probably call consciousness.

04:16:44.620 --> 04:16:52.620
And so the reason that the robot isn't conscious is because the robot has such a narrow scope of options available to it that it's too simple.

04:16:52.620 --> 04:16:58.620
The minute that you know it is consciousness is the feeling of what it's like. This is what you need to produce.

04:16:58.620 --> 04:17:02.620
So what is the feeling complexity is not producing a feeling.

04:17:02.620 --> 04:17:13.620
But hold on. So if you're saying that everything that a human does can be reduced to a utility function, if you have a sufficiently complex understanding of their internal landscape,

04:17:13.620 --> 04:17:20.620
then what feelings are is they are the experience of the utility function.

04:17:20.620 --> 04:17:26.620
The utility function causes some kind of chemical change inside of you that can be modulated either with neurotransmitters.

04:17:26.620 --> 04:17:30.620
It can be modulated with the potassium sodium balance at the membranes.

04:17:30.620 --> 04:17:35.620
It can be modulated by the harmonics of your brain waves.

04:17:35.620 --> 04:17:44.620
And when you're doing that thing, you have this full body electrochemical state that is the experience.

04:17:44.620 --> 04:17:48.620
It is the experience lives inside of the body.

04:17:48.620 --> 04:17:57.620
And so your feeling of a decision that you make is the result of everything that happens inside of your body as you are making the decision.

04:17:57.620 --> 04:18:06.620
That's what feeling is. It's the sum total of the whole electrochemical state of the entire body as it does something.

04:18:06.620 --> 04:18:09.620
With respect to the rest of the universe.

04:18:09.620 --> 04:18:11.620
I would.

04:18:11.620 --> 04:18:21.620
It's very poetic, but it's not convincing to me because it's still just clockwork and would not explain why there is an agent that experiences itself experiencing something.

04:18:21.620 --> 04:18:28.620
Well, because the agent has to be the agent has to be able to say, I'm experiencing this and this is good.

04:18:28.620 --> 04:18:35.620
And I will keep experiencing it because the agent's job is to make sure that the internal state is such that it can reproduce.

04:18:35.620 --> 04:18:42.620
That's the agent's job. The agent's job is that life is a state of matter that aims towards complexity.

04:18:42.620 --> 04:18:50.620
And your job as the agent is to make sure that this crystalline structure of life survives for long enough to make more of itself.

04:18:50.620 --> 04:18:54.620
And if you fuck that up by feeling bad all the time, you're not going to make that goal.

04:18:54.620 --> 04:18:57.620
And if you don't make that goal, you have failed at your mission.

04:18:57.620 --> 04:19:05.620
And so the feeling is the agent who's responsible for enacting the goal, checking in to be like, Hey, are we on the right track?

04:19:05.620 --> 04:19:14.620
Don't buy the idea that your uncertainty about whether you're going to reproduce is reflecting uncertainty about whether you're conscious or not.

04:19:14.620 --> 04:19:16.620
Hold on. Say it again.

04:19:16.620 --> 04:19:19.620
You just connected it to reproduction.

04:19:19.620 --> 04:19:26.620
And at the beginning of our conversation, you did mention uncertainty about whether you intend to reproduce.

04:19:26.620 --> 04:19:30.620
This does not reflect uncertainty about your consciousness, right?

04:19:30.620 --> 04:19:33.620
Your consciousness is completely uncorrelated to this.

04:19:33.620 --> 04:19:38.620
No, but your feelings are correlated to some of them.

04:19:38.620 --> 04:19:41.620
Some of them are, but not the ability to feel it itself.

04:19:41.620 --> 04:19:53.620
The ability to feel itself has to be the result of some causal process that a lot of people find confusing to get at because it is not apparent how a physical system would feel.

04:19:53.620 --> 04:19:58.620
It seems to me that feeling is a property that you can only dream.

04:19:58.620 --> 04:20:03.620
And what we have to explain is how a physical system is able to produce dreams.

04:20:04.620 --> 04:20:15.620
I think that the question of how a physical system can produce dreams is a really interesting question, but it might be a good place for us to pause because we've been going.

04:20:15.620 --> 04:20:25.620
I also think that it's worth it's interesting that if we can't explain how humans are able to produce feelings, then we can't rule out the fact that bacteria produce feelings as well.

04:20:25.620 --> 04:20:27.620
But this is not the point.

04:20:27.620 --> 04:20:36.620
I think we can explain how humans produce feelings by coming up with an explanation that would produce a causal agent that is reporting feelings.

04:20:36.620 --> 04:20:43.620
The fact that bacteria do not report feelings is a possible indication that they don't have any.

04:20:43.620 --> 04:20:50.620
The fact that people report feelings produces this burden of explanation of this phenomenon.

04:20:50.620 --> 04:20:57.620
To simply say that both people and bacteria are alive and therefore both have feelings is somewhat unsatisfactory.

04:20:57.620 --> 04:21:04.620
I don't think that bacteria have the same feelings as humans.

04:21:04.620 --> 04:21:07.620
I think it's just really healthy to leave it in the hypothetical realm.

04:21:07.620 --> 04:21:11.620
You said something earlier where you just were like, well, it's possible or something like that.

04:21:11.620 --> 04:21:17.620
And I think that's often the best place we can get with our theoretical understanding of nature is whether something is possible.

04:21:18.620 --> 04:21:27.620
I have a suspicion that what is going on is some distinction about the kind of nature of the universe that we are in.

04:21:27.620 --> 04:21:38.620
When I was a kid, I read books about physics and our normal post-enlightenment modernist way of understanding our own place in the universe.

04:21:38.620 --> 04:21:44.620
And I read Klawatsky and Aveda and other books.

04:21:44.620 --> 04:21:53.620
And I realized that there seem to be two fundamentally different conceptions about the nature of the reality that we find ourselves being thrown in.

04:21:53.620 --> 04:22:00.620
And one is that we are basically in a machine and we are part of the machine and it is nothing that is not part of the machine.

04:22:00.620 --> 04:22:10.620
And that's basically the physicalist idea that there is a costly, closed, lowest layer that is entirely mechanical over which everything else emerges without any magic ever happening.

04:22:10.620 --> 04:22:14.620
And in this world, it's pretty hard to explain miracles.

04:22:14.620 --> 04:22:19.620
And the existence of our consciousness seems to be somewhat close to a miracle.

04:22:19.620 --> 04:22:29.620
And if we would perceive magical stuff, like if you're able to burn a black cat and as a result we perceive a new kind of celestial event,

04:22:29.620 --> 04:22:39.620
this kind of symbolic interaction would also what classifies as a miracle because it cannot easily be explained by some causal interaction on them,

04:22:39.620 --> 04:22:43.620
some causally closed lowest layer that doesn't care about symbols.

04:22:43.620 --> 04:22:54.620
And the other explanation that we could be in, that the one that is implied by Castaneda's worldview and so on, is that we are living in a dream.

04:22:54.620 --> 04:23:04.620
That magic is possible and that the reason why miracles are so rare is the result of the way in which we are dreaming the dream.

04:23:04.620 --> 04:23:13.620
So all the causal structure that seems to be so regular, the regularity of physics and so on in this worldview is explained by features in which the dream is happening.

04:23:13.620 --> 04:23:23.620
And later on, as I try to think about these worldviews and make a distinction about them, I did notice that indeed I am living clearly in a dream.

04:23:23.620 --> 04:23:29.620
There's lots of evidence that I'm living in a dream because the features of my dream are malleable.

04:23:30.620 --> 04:23:35.620
It's very much like a lucid dream at night. I can change the way that a face looks like to me.

04:23:35.620 --> 04:23:43.620
I can change my memories over the past. I can change my identity. I can change aspects of my consciousness in a pretty fundamental sense.

04:23:43.620 --> 04:23:54.620
So I am clearly living in a dream. But the regularity in the dream can be explained by there being a parent universe in which there is some kind of machinery that is producing the dream.

04:23:55.620 --> 04:24:02.620
And the machinery that is producing the dream is the brain of a primate in a physical universe.

04:24:02.620 --> 04:24:09.620
And in this way, I can fit it all together and I can explain consciousness as a dream property that cannot be explained physically.

04:24:09.620 --> 04:24:14.620
Like neurons cannot experience anything. Consciousness only exists as if.

04:24:14.620 --> 04:24:20.620
Neurons can do stuff as if. They can produce representations that only exist as if.

04:24:20.620 --> 04:24:28.620
In the same way as stuff in a computer game is only as if. It's virtual. It's only existing as a projection.

04:24:28.620 --> 04:24:36.620
And I think that consciousness is a projection. It's a representational property of a system that is aware of the fact that it's aware.

04:24:36.620 --> 04:24:40.620
And this is crucial thing about it that has to do with this hard problem.

04:24:40.620 --> 04:24:44.620
And it is not readily apparent when you think what you see is physics in the physical universe.

04:24:44.620 --> 04:24:53.620
And it could be that you don't perceive this as so much as a problem because you have committed yourself relatively early to the insight that you're living in some kind of dream.

04:24:53.620 --> 04:25:01.620
And in this dream, you can dream about vibrations that produce phenomena in biological systems and that are intrinsically related to consciousness.

04:25:01.620 --> 04:25:11.620
You experience yourself in this dream. You experience that everything is consciousness in the world. Everything that you touch is representational.

04:25:12.620 --> 04:25:17.620
And I think that's true because we actually are living in that dream.

04:25:17.620 --> 04:25:25.620
And physics is really talking about another universe that we can never touch, that can only be described as mathematics.

04:25:25.620 --> 04:25:33.620
And my task is to explain stuff in this outside reality that we can never touch, that we can never be in using mathematical languages.

04:25:34.620 --> 04:25:40.620
I think that you have struck at the heart of our disagreement then.

04:25:40.620 --> 04:25:47.620
Because I do think that there is a very different perspective that we're coming at.

04:25:47.620 --> 04:25:49.620
Do you want to elaborate?

04:25:49.620 --> 04:25:54.620
No, go ahead. I mean, you're just saying I don't think we agree about what physics is fundamentally.

04:25:55.620 --> 04:26:02.620
Shiloh has expressed that after several hours, he started meeting at 11. Now it's a quarter to four.

04:26:02.620 --> 04:26:07.620
He is getting a little bit exhausted, which I think is very human and understandable.

04:26:10.620 --> 04:26:13.620
It is hard to sit in a chair for three or four hours.

04:26:13.620 --> 04:26:23.620
But I just think that fundamentally we're approaching physics as a material science, not as a mathematical science, which starts with bodies interacting with one another.

04:26:23.620 --> 04:26:30.620
And you can treat this landscape of bodies interacting as a territory and you can make mathematical maps for it.

04:26:30.620 --> 04:26:35.620
But ultimately, a body is a surface-bound volume that has inward extension.

04:26:35.620 --> 04:26:40.620
But you know that physics, the surface-bound volumes are emergent over stuff that is more simple.

04:26:40.620 --> 04:26:49.620
And ultimately, physics is about information that you can conceptualize as existing in different locations and moving in certain trajectories.

04:26:49.620 --> 04:26:59.620
Yes, but biology is a subset of physics. It's a subset of physics that describes the dynamics of cells, which are complicated arrangements of molecular machinery.

04:26:59.620 --> 04:27:03.620
There exist many levels above the course of the lowest level of physics.

04:27:03.620 --> 04:27:14.620
There exist certain levels of coarse graining where you already are assuming that particles exist and particles form molecules in some way and the molecules are forming cellular machinery.

04:27:14.620 --> 04:27:17.620
But I would never assume that particles exist, right?

04:27:17.620 --> 04:27:22.620
I mean, a particle is just an instantiation of some measurement or predicted measurement.

04:27:22.620 --> 04:27:27.620
It's a dynamic factor. A particle is not a static body that has an architecture to it, right?

04:27:27.620 --> 04:27:31.620
Only bodies that have locations can exist.

04:27:31.620 --> 04:27:37.620
You can imagine all sorts of bodies like your cenotaur that doesn't exist. It has no location in the universe.

04:27:37.620 --> 04:27:41.620
You don't live in a universe that actually has localization in space.

04:27:41.620 --> 04:27:45.620
Localization is something that emerges to some degree of approximation in our universe.

04:27:45.620 --> 04:27:48.620
Well, localization is just your distance to the other objects.

04:27:48.620 --> 04:27:51.620
It's just the distance to all of them.

04:27:51.620 --> 04:27:53.620
There is no distance.

04:27:53.620 --> 04:27:56.620
What do you mean if two bodies are touching one another?

04:27:56.620 --> 04:28:02.620
If you basically zoom in very hard, what you notice is that you only have a quantum universe.

04:28:02.620 --> 04:28:07.620
Well, that's a mathematical description. Once again, that's not actually what's physically meaningful.

04:28:07.620 --> 04:28:09.620
Exactly. It's the lowest level of physics.

04:28:09.620 --> 04:28:14.620
No, it's the lowest level at which we've been able to conceptualize it is that we're using mathematics to describe it.

04:28:14.620 --> 04:28:18.620
I don't mean that because I can mathematically describe the table that it's made out of math.

04:28:18.620 --> 04:28:20.620
It's just that the table can be described by math.

04:28:20.620 --> 04:28:25.620
The atoms have architecture which allows them to do all of their incredible properties, right?

04:28:25.620 --> 04:28:29.620
Their architecture fundamentally is what allows them to do light and gravity.

04:28:29.620 --> 04:28:37.620
We don't have a good model in the mainstream for how those atoms' architectures provide for those mysterious phenomena.

04:28:37.620 --> 04:28:41.620
We just describe them with math and move on because it allows us to build technology.

04:28:41.620 --> 04:28:47.620
Your tables are real, but quantum effects are not real.

04:28:47.620 --> 04:28:55.620
I didn't say real. I just said it's really, really important to frame the definition of existence in physics,

04:28:55.620 --> 04:28:59.620
where physics starts with bodies that exist. They have to exist.

04:28:59.620 --> 04:29:05.620
They have to have that architecture and it has to have a location with respect to the other bodies in the presentation.

04:29:05.620 --> 04:29:07.620
That's not quite true.

04:29:07.620 --> 04:29:13.620
I think that there are levels in foundational physics where you don't have bodies which are surface-constrained volumes.

04:29:13.620 --> 04:29:16.620
Not everything has a location.

04:29:16.620 --> 04:29:21.620
This is a mistake, though. This is a mistake because then you're talking about unicorns and things that don't exist,

04:29:21.620 --> 04:29:25.620
even though you can conceptualize them. They don't necessarily pertain to the physical world.

04:29:25.620 --> 04:29:27.620
You're talking about something that is more basic than your bodies.

04:29:27.620 --> 04:29:31.620
You're talking about something that gives rise to bodies, that is more fundamental than bodies.

04:29:31.620 --> 04:29:34.620
But bodies are fundamental to physics, is my point.

04:29:34.620 --> 04:29:37.620
You can't do physics. You're not talking about physics.

04:29:37.620 --> 04:29:39.620
My point is that your point is wrong.

04:29:39.620 --> 04:29:41.620
Then how do you define physics, I guess?

04:29:41.620 --> 04:29:44.620
Basically, go to a foundational physics conference and not talking about bodies there.

04:29:44.620 --> 04:29:48.620
That's a problem. That's a really big problem. They were before 150 years ago.

04:29:48.620 --> 04:29:50.620
They were absolutely only talking about bodies.

04:29:50.620 --> 04:29:52.620
Progress is a bitch, I understand.

04:29:52.620 --> 04:29:57.620
It's not necessarily progress, right? It's actually getting us down all of these rabbit holes

04:29:57.620 --> 04:30:00.620
where we have completely untestable theories that aren't necessarily providing for technology,

04:30:00.620 --> 04:30:06.620
like string theory, for instance, or our doomsday cosmology,

04:30:06.620 --> 04:30:10.620
which is predicated on non-physical situations that emerge from the mathematics

04:30:10.620 --> 04:30:14.620
but don't have any empirical evidence on earth whatsoever.

04:30:14.620 --> 04:30:20.620
Okay. I sense that we basically arrived at a point where we will not be able in the next few minutes

04:30:20.620 --> 04:30:26.620
to achieve consensus. I think that's fine. Let's leave it at that for today.

04:30:26.620 --> 04:30:27.620
Absolutely.

04:30:27.620 --> 04:30:32.620
Thank you, Shiloh. Thank you, Anastasia. I really enjoyed our conversation today.

04:30:32.620 --> 04:30:34.620
Thank you for inviting me on your podcast.

04:30:34.620 --> 04:30:38.620
I enjoy being with you. I enjoy the perspective that you bring to this

04:30:38.620 --> 04:30:42.620
and the overall intention that you have behind your exploration.

04:30:42.620 --> 04:30:47.620
The feeling is mutual. Thank you so much for taking the time and for the ideas

04:30:47.620 --> 04:30:54.620
and the many, many questions that we will continue exploring after this conversation.

04:30:54.620 --> 04:30:58.620
It's been stimulating. Thank you. Thank you, Yasha. Take care. Bye-bye.

04:30:58.620 --> 04:30:59.620
Have a great rest of your day.
