0	26160	Anastasia, I believe, was taunting you on Twitter or something over the hard question
26160	27160	of consciousness.
27240	31440	I think I was mostly taunting all of Twitter because something that I've really struggled
31440	36640	with is that I haven't been able to find someone who can satisfactorily explain the
36640	39120	hard problem of consciousness to me.
39120	43200	And every time somebody explains it, I'm like, that doesn't seem like a problem.
43200	44200	Yes.
44200	48440	So the unusual way in which you're looking at it is not so much that you have difficulty
48440	52520	understanding the hard problem, but you have difficulty to understand by others think the
52520	53520	problem is hard.
53520	54520	Yeah, exactly.
54520	55520	Right?
55520	56520	I think I might help with that.
57000	58000	That's what I was hoping for.
58000	60800	Despite that being the unusual perspective.
60800	63400	And so it's funny because that's what I said on Twitter.
63400	66360	I'm like, can somebody please explain to me why this problem is hard?
66360	69080	And somebody was like, you need to talk to Josje.
69080	73960	And I was like, I emailed Josje a while ago, but we were, we started the show as puppets.
73960	75600	I don't know.
75600	81840	So we were, we built these giant aliens and we would puppet the interviews because we
81840	89640	wanted, we decided that the ideas that we wanted to explore scientifically were so far
89640	94920	out because the goal of the show is to explore the theories that will overturn current paradigms
94920	98520	in geology, cosmology, biology, physics, whatever.
98520	102600	And so we always find people that have these kind of weird ideas and we were like, okay,
102600	108780	this will be more acceptable if it's not humans doing the conversation, but it's aliens.
108780	111380	Because then there's this fictional frame that people can be comfortable in.
111380	112380	And after-
112380	115460	I think we were, to be honest, I think we were a little scared of putting ourselves,
115460	117780	our faces and just being people on the internet.
117780	122100	We really wanted, we were scared of that initially, but we got over it.
122100	126260	One of our mentors was like, you have to stop this.
126260	130940	He actually came on the show and he talked to the puppets for like three hours, no longer.
130940	132640	We recorded a bunch of episodes with him.
132640	135880	And then at the end he was like, what you're doing is great.
135880	137700	You can't keep doing it this way.
137700	140300	And then after that we got rid of the puppets, they're in a box in a closet.
140300	145020	And so here we are.
145020	148640	And so I think I emailed you when we were still the alien puppets, and that's a really
148640	152620	hard sell for people because you have to be like, hey, would you come on the show and
152620	156220	be interviewed by aliens that are puppets?
156220	159940	And everyone was like, no.
159940	164100	Well, I think we are anthropomorphizing people too much.
164100	168780	So principle open to trying different presentations.
168780	172700	Sometimes the puppet is limited because you can express less.
172700	176700	I think the idea of making something that is not human, but more expressive than a human
176700	180580	being, that would be potentially quite interesting as an experiment.
180580	185660	I think that's what really killed it is we couldn't make eye contact and we couldn't
185660	188780	having a conversation is so much more than the words that are happening, right?
188780	193880	That's why it's often difficult to talk to people on the telephone about very serious
193880	199280	or important matters because you can't see them and gauge their reaction.
199280	203200	Of course you could puppetify the interview after the fact.
203200	204200	That's true.
204200	206200	That'd be a lot of work though.
206200	208520	So we try to put out two of these a week.
208520	212480	You'll probably notice us, by the way, we do like camera changes during the show.
212480	214560	So don't be alarmed.
214560	215640	We don't want to edit later.
215640	218740	So we try to get it all while we're recording.
218740	223100	One thing that might be good is if I can do a very, very brief phone call at 11.30.
223100	226740	And then we have time probably way into the afternoon.
226740	227740	Okay.
227740	228740	Fantastic.
228740	229740	So basically we have open-ended.
229740	230740	That's incredible.
230740	232220	If we do this two or three hours, that's fine.
232220	234260	Do you want to just start after the phone call?
234260	235780	Yeah, let's do that.
235780	241820	We can spend the next 10 minutes just chatting about...
241820	246420	It seemed to me that you have career questions that you are pondering.
246420	247420	Is this correct?
248420	255180	I'm interested in the way that people shape their lives when they have more freedom than
255180	258700	the average person.
258700	263740	Because I think that most people show up and they work at a place and they stay there and
263740	269660	they advance on the basis of necessity and availability.
269660	274480	And then there's other people who stop and they look around and they really plan what
274480	275900	it is that they want.
275900	276900	Yes.
277380	283420	So the question is mostly how to get rid of your fear and that seems to be the hard thing.
283420	289620	I recently watched a presentation by Sam Altman where he told the story that he often watches
289620	294740	people who decide to start a company first so they become free and then can do the thing
294740	296060	that they want.
296060	299060	And his perspective that never works.
299060	303580	Basically people always get stuck doing their company and not achieving the thing that they
303580	306100	actually wanted to do.
307020	309780	So to him that's not a very good strategy.
309780	314300	Then again I think that his perspective is also a little bit unfair because not starting
314300	318100	a company and just doing the thing that you want also doesn't work.
318100	320100	So it's tricky.
320100	321100	It's an alignment issue.
321100	322100	Yeah.
322100	327100	But I find when I want to talk to my former self and mostly want to tell my former self
327100	332180	that I shouldn't worry so much like you'll never be rich but there will always be enough
332380	336900	money to keep you and your family afloat.
336900	341060	Just do the thing that you want to do and do it well because if the thing that you want
341060	347100	to do is sufficiently important and there are too few people doing it you will be able
347100	349220	to do it.
349220	355060	And so besides that I would say I should be a lot more calmer because despite my tastes
355060	360740	being very rare they have a reason for the things that I'm doing and for the stuff that
360740	366380	I'm interested in and institutions have reasons for not finding this and there's actual reasons
366380	370460	but not good reasons.
370460	376500	That's a huge part of what we processed before starting this project where it was possible
376500	381420	to continue down the line and to stay in the academic world but it was always going to
381420	385080	be tangential to the things that we wanted.
385080	390340	And it's hard in the density of media that there is in the world right now to start a
390380	397580	project like this because there's 30 million podcasts.
397580	405580	And so most of them have two or three episodes but still that's a reflection of just how
405580	411100	saturated the space is and it took us not that long to figure out that we were putting
411100	415180	something into the world that people really wanted and so it's allowed us to continue
415180	418300	but it's also...
418300	424540	Well one thing that's been really shocking to me is that you don't need a huge audience
424540	429740	but you do need an audience that's really good and really supportive and really really
429740	432640	interested in what you're doing.
432640	437340	Because we've been able to basically support ourselves with a pretty modest audience at
437340	444540	this point because our proportion of patrons to audience is kind of unheard of.
444540	448100	The people who listen to our show really care about these topics a lot.
448100	450700	But there's just not that many people that we've found so far.
450700	454060	I mean we've only been doing this for a year and a half.
454060	458380	There's just a small audience for these niche ideas it seems like too.
458380	459860	So that was kind of shocking to me.
459860	460860	That's not quite true.
460860	466660	I found that the Lex Friedman podcasts in some sense are serving a similar audience
466660	469580	and Lex arguably is not even that good.
469580	474860	He prepares himself well and so on and he tries to be serious about what he does and
474940	478420	he treats the people that he gets on the show very well.
478420	484340	But I think his main appeal is the speakers that he gets on the show.
484340	486020	He's really well connected right?
486020	491620	He's buddies with Joe Rogan and he had an enormous platform right out of the gate.
491620	497820	Yeah I mean he I think started out just playing his MIT card relatively well and then turning
497820	501700	this into a brand that he carefully curated.
501740	508540	And he gets millions of views for single shows which for a science tech podcast is really
508540	509540	a lot.
509540	511800	Yeah it's incredible.
511800	515500	And if you see the things that really fly you notice that of course if you want to do
515500	520300	audience maximizing you have to do something completely different.
520300	525940	I've noticed that there's a lot of podcasts that get trapped by an audience that can be
525940	526940	readily mined.
526980	532300	I don't know if you've noticed that there's some big ish podcasts not Lex Friedman sized
532300	537340	that are really into UFOs, that are really into crystal healing.
537340	538340	There's all these different…
538340	542420	Well they start off as interested in all sorts of sciences and then they find out that they
542420	549220	get the most views from say UFO videos or ancient aliens, I don't know, these sort
549220	556420	of fantastical niches and that's all they end up doing for the rest of their career.
556460	561340	I think it's a little bit depressing for them in the end because they're forced into
561340	564020	something that they didn't really set out to do.
564020	565020	So we're trying really hard to avoid that.
565020	566020	It depends.
566020	569220	They are starting out as telemarketers who are trying to get an audience.
569220	570220	That's true.
570220	571220	Right?
571220	574220	And the alternative is doing stir straps.
574220	576020	What's that?
576020	579540	I think Anastasia can explain it to you at some point.
579540	580540	She's our Twitter.
581340	587660	Yeah, one of the things that I love so much about Shiloh is that he lives partially dissociated
587660	591940	from the pop cultural landscape and so sometimes people will say things and Shiloh will be
591940	592940	like, what is that?
592940	593940	I've never heard of that.
593940	594940	And I'm like, that's…
594940	597140	I love that.
597140	601540	And so a stir strap is, I've never had to define it before, but it's a thing that somebody
601540	610220	posts in order to induce coveting in someone else, usually lascivious coveting.
610620	612620	In the context of Science Podcasts?
612620	613620	Well, there's some like…
613620	616620	In every context, cleavage always seems to work.
616620	622620	Basically, the demand for good cleavage is much higher than the demand for good philosophy.
622620	625620	And in some sense, that has integrity, I guess.
625620	629620	It's not my market, but basically, I see it.
629620	630620	I'm not sure if I'm envious.
630620	635620	I think I would be envious if I were doing my own podcast because it's so unfair.
636020	643220	It is really a tricky scene because you want to remain full of integrity for the way that
643220	645620	you see the world and how you approach it.
645620	649580	But then you go into looking at the algorithm and looking at what succeeds and looking at
649580	654820	what explodes and you realize that you have to pander to people's most basic desires
654820	656620	in the most obvious way possible.
656620	657620	Like, there's a video…
657620	660620	I feel like the Minoan ladies figured this out.
660620	662620	You know, have you seen these?
662620	663620	Yeah.
663620	664620	Okay.
665620	684620	I mean, in an ideal world, she would be both hot as hell and brilliant, but I feel like
684620	685620	those are normally…
685620	690620	By the time that you have to gimmick to cleavage, I'm not sure that you have the top shelf
690620	691620	questions.
691620	695620	I think there's a difference between beauty and grace on one hand and hotness on the
695620	700620	other because hotness is an advertisement of something that you do not plan to deliver.
700620	705620	It's a manipulative game and that is in some sense distorting the playing field.
705620	707620	I love that.
707620	709620	That's very well put.
709620	710620	Yeah, that's exactly right.
710620	713620	How did you come to have this definition?
713620	716620	Just observing.
716620	722620	I noticed that some of the people, some of the women I liked most were not hot and I
722620	726620	tried to put my finger on what actually defines hotness.
726620	733620	You don't actually need to be beautiful to be hot because it is an offer that is being
733620	739620	made despite this offer not being something that is actually fungible because it wouldn't
739620	741620	be sustainable.
741620	743620	That's interesting.
743620	748620	It puts a real negative spin on hotness, which is interesting, because it's in some
748620	756620	sense that unwillingness to deliver almost necessitates resentment in the viewer.
756620	761620	It might be, but if you understand that it's a game and it's okay in your culture to play
761620	766620	that game, it just creates another dimension, but it's a dimension that for instance would
766620	769620	definitely distract from doing a philosophy podcast.
769620	772620	Some communities have strong norms against it.
772620	777620	For instance, when I was in Boston, most of my friends were Eastern European Jews outside
777620	778620	of MIT and Harvard.
778620	784620	I just got adopted by a bunch of people who took me to Burning Man and into their circles
784620	786620	of friends and I felt very much at home there.
786620	791620	At some point, a girl who was not part of this community told me that she felt that
791620	796620	the women there hated her and were really bad to her and so on.
796620	801620	Then I realized none of these women in this community were putting on makeup.
801620	807620	Basically, there was a tacit agreement to not play certain games because it would distort
807620	809620	the interactions between people.
809620	813620	There are contexts in which you are going out for a dance or in which you are flirting
813620	819620	or mating or whatever, but in normal everyday contexts you don't do that.
819620	825620	This is where I became very conscious of it, because it's also something that is taboo
825620	829620	among the women that I live with.
829620	836620	The contextualization of your presentation is something that I stress out about a lot, actually.
836620	839620	We literally were stressing out about this yesterday or the day before.
839620	844620	Yeah, because I had to figure it out when I started lecturing at the university because
844620	846620	normally I just wear shorts and a t-shirt.
846620	849620	We live in the country, we're gardening all the time.
849620	856620	I'm pretty casual, but there's something about making people comfortable in a context.
856620	860620	I guess if everybody else is wearing makeup at a dance, then it would make sense.
860620	865620	It's something about at least putting on a blazer or something that makes the audience
865620	869620	more comfortable if your audience is in a professional context.
869620	875620	It's weird to walk that line because at some point you can just be putting on something
875620	879620	that you're not if you go too far with it.
879620	883620	At the other hand, you're trying to make everybody comfortable.
883620	885620	It's tricky.
886620	890620	Authenticity is for sale when you're on the internet.
890620	899620	The social mores of what makes for an authentic experience inside of you
899620	903620	and between you and your audience, I think, is along the same line of
903620	909620	you have a group of people and there's a set of rules and everybody conforms to those rules.
910620	915620	That feels authentic because the rules have been set at the lowest possible level of
915620	921620	we're not going to interrupt this interaction on the basis of how we paint ourselves.
921620	926620	When you come into the position that Shail and I are in where we're on television,
926620	930620	it's not really television, but it's still that principle.
930620	932620	It's television for young people.
932620	935620	It's also television for old people.
935620	937620	Exactly.
937620	941620	There is this constant question of, okay, well, who are you?
941620	943620	What do you show?
943620	948620	How do these decisions make people feel as you show them?
948620	954620	And how close to you are those decisions when the camera's off?
954620	959620	And how good of a job do you have to do in bringing those things together
959620	963620	so that in an intellectual conversation with somebody over Zoom,
963620	966620	you're the same person that you are when you're later washing dishes
966620	969620	or dealing with the fact that the cat puked everywhere?
969620	972620	Yeah, I think the most important thing is sincerity.
972620	975620	Once you fake that, you've got it made.
978620	980620	I just find it to be the hardest thing in the world.
980620	984620	I mean, I hope I don't fail at it too often, but I find it to be the hardest thing in the world
984620	988620	to just be yourself in a public space where everybody's staring at you
988620	993620	and just really work on yourself to the point that you're comfortable with yourself
993620	996620	and you don't have to pretend to be somebody else.
996620	998620	Just become more autistic, like me.
1000620	1004620	I sometimes wish that I could. I wish there was a switch.
1004620	1008620	I grew up in a really close-knit family, so I was born in Russia.
1008620	1012620	We moved to Israel. We moved to Canada. We moved to the United States.
1012620	1017620	And when we came to the United States, there was just five of us in the entire hemisphere.
1017620	1021620	No family here, no friends. It was just this little nucleus.
1021620	1025620	And so my family was very, very tightly knit to the degree that
1025620	1031620	most of my parents' friends let their kids lose their Russian.
1031620	1035620	We spoke Russian at home. We still speak it. We text in Russian.
1035620	1039620	I haven't lived in Russia in 33 years.
1039620	1042620	My brother was not born in Russia. He was born in Canada.
1042620	1045620	He speaks, reads, and writes Russian.
1045620	1050620	And that, I think, was only possible because of the way that the family was interwoven.
1050620	1056620	And so I've grown up with this just constant monitoring of people's states, right?
1056620	1060620	Because when you have this very tight-knit family and everybody's emotionally intertwined,
1060620	1062620	you have to be aware of everything that's happening.
1062620	1064620	And sometimes I wish that I could just turn it off.
1064620	1067620	I wish that I could just go out into the world and be like, I don't care.
1067620	1068620	I don't care. I don't care.
1068620	1072620	That makes total sense, but I don't think that being an American is an option.
1072620	1076620	Why would you give up your soul?
1076620	1080620	These are savages. They are socialized with three generations of Disney.
1080620	1083620	There is no culture.
1083620	1088620	That's me. Yeah, that's right. I grew up right in the heart of America, in the suburbs in Ohio.
1088620	1090620	I was raised on Hollywood.
1090620	1091620	America's test market.
1091620	1094620	Shiloh would always tell me that he grew up in Columbus, Ohio.
1094620	1096620	What was the thing that you would tell me?
1096620	1099620	It's like the restaurant test market of the world.
1099620	1104620	And for all the brands, they try out all the clothes and foods on the Ohio people
1104620	1108620	because they're the most middle-of-the-road people in all of America, essentially.
1108620	1111620	So yeah, raised on Hollywood.
1111620	1119620	We went to church, but it was a very empty culture, for sure.
1119620	1122620	It was difficult to find my way out of that.
1122620	1127620	Being at unease with the world is, in some sense, what brings most of the interesting people together.
1127620	1133620	This thing that you feel profoundly not at home in the world that you're in,
1133620	1137620	that you dislike the aesthetics of the world around you.
1137620	1142620	And this creates a tension that allows you to become conscious of who you are
1142620	1147620	because it requires that you reflect your own identity in some sense and construct it.
1147620	1150620	It's something that works for you.
1150620	1153620	Yeah, but you don't have any role models.
1153620	1157620	That was the most difficult thing for me growing up.
1157620	1160620	Yeah, but imitating role models are the worst. Come on.
1160620	1163620	Interesting. God, I had a hard time.
1163620	1170620	I had a career in music, and I was very much interested in poetry and art.
1170620	1176620	I tried to look up to a lot of my favorite artists, but I always found that they were flawed human beings.
1176620	1181620	It was really difficult for me to learn that there are no real idols for you.
1181620	1184620	There's nobody to model yourself on.
1184620	1186620	It was just really hard for me for some reason.
1186620	1188620	It took me most of my 20s to get through that.
1188620	1199620	When I was in Berlin, we put up pictures in our apartment of Boris Vian and Brentano and Milan Chomsky.
1199620	1206620	And basically, the living ones, I got to know when I came to the US, like Minsky and Chomsky.
1206620	1211620	And I realized how human they were and how flawed as human beings.
1212620	1218620	And it was an important insight for me to see that what makes people great is usually some defect in their psyche,
1218620	1221620	because the incentives for being great are actually not great.
1221620	1227620	And so true greatness typically emerges over some disturbance in your crystal structure.
1227620	1233620	My take on Chomsky is that he is somebody who failed very hard as a child due to being a nerd.
1233620	1238620	And he happens to be one of the best writers of his generation.
1238620	1245620	He puts out stuff not in paragraphs like me, but in entire chapters, complete with reference.
1245620	1248620	You ask him something, he gives you a book chapter every time.
1248620	1253620	But it's not designed to be true. It's designed to win the debate.
1253620	1259620	And he's an extremely skilled debater who has won a lot of debates in which he was wrong.
1259620	1262620	And he's smart enough to realize this.
1262620	1269620	And I think he should be smart enough to understand the damage that he had been wreaking, for instance, in linguistics,
1269620	1273620	due to insisting on being right in situations where he didn't have an answer.
1273620	1280620	And where he was basically stomping out tiny grasses that could have grown into something interesting.
1280620	1282620	And a similar thing happened to Minsky.
1282620	1291620	So I think that sometimes the greatest people are also the ones who are creating peril if they are surrounded by people who are less great than them and cannot transcend them.
1291620	1295620	Most people don't take greatness as a stepping stone.
1295620	1297620	So if you don't feel threatened by greatness, it's good.
1297620	1304620	But most people really feel in this mid-width range where they can copy theories and propagate theories,
1304620	1308620	but cannot make up their own and not disprove existing theories.
1308620	1313620	Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying this conversation. It's a really good one.

1352620	1359620	The biggest hurdle in my own life, just even in a marriage or anything, being able to win an argument doesn't necessarily help you.
1359620	1362620	And when I go and I talk about people with my own theoretical ideas,
1362620	1370620	recognizing that, oh, I could just win this argument really quickly isn't going to get me into developing my ideas more.
1370620	1375620	And I always have to force myself to remember that there are things I might not know.
1375620	1379620	And maybe this person has access to them, even if they're not presenting them in the best way possible.
1379620	1387620	And my goal is to keep that conversation going so that I can stir up new developments in my own ideas, not necessarily just to win the argument.
1387620	1393620	And it's such a hard thing to beat your ego down over and move on with.
1393620	1399620	I had this in earlier relationships, but not in my present one, which has been going on for 26 years.
1399620	1408620	And I find it has to do a lot with the attitude that you have to each other when you feel that you are basically two thoughts in the same mind.
1408620	1413620	And you also don't try to convince yourself of something that may or may not be true.
1413620	1419620	And there's usually fear involved that the other one is going to create a reality that is untrue.
1419620	1428620	And if there's a mutual understanding that both of you are going for the same aesthetic, that the end goal that you are going for is the same.
1428620	1431620	And you're just looking at different parts of the world.
1431620	1439620	And there is a very big interest in listening to the objections of the other because they all allow you to see more depth in the things that are happening.
1439620	1443620	And sometimes you get scared, but you get stressed out and you're not able to think clearly.
1443620	1449620	And then there's the question, how can you get back to the space where you trust each other?
1449620	1454620	And when you don't have the same goal and the same aesthetics, you need a new relationship anyway.
1454620	1458620	Have you considered going to marriage counseling as a third option?
1458620	1462620	I'm not sure that I can solve most people's problems.
1462620	1467620	Basically, I'm too idiosyncratic and too rare.
1467620	1473620	I can help some people with some of their problems if they have similar problems as the ones that I'm somewhat familiar with.
1473620	1476620	But I also cannot solve most of my own problems.
1476620	1479620	So I'm not somebody who is a spiritual teacher.
1479620	1482620	I did notice that marriage counselors are not being stopped by this.
1482620	1487620	So when my wife and me had a deep, severe two-year relationship crisis,
1487620	1492620	we went to a number of counselors who all basically told us to abandon all hope.
1492620	1498620	But all of them were singles. None of them had a working relationship.
1498620	1501620	It's kind of like going to the doctor that's really unhealthy looking.
1501620	1504620	And you're like, I don't know if I'm going to take nutritional advice from you.
1504620	1505620	Yeah.
1505620	1509620	And they also had an idea about relationships that I thought was unsustainable.
1509620	1514620	There's a notion that you're only entitled to a relationship if you don't actually need one.
1514620	1519620	First of all, put yourself into a state where you don't need a relationship, then you can have one.
1519620	1524620	Because there's this big danger of codependency that is looming over your head.
1524620	1529620	But there's another perspective, which is that you're intrinsically incomplete the way in which you're born.
1529620	1536620	And in order to become complete, you need to find somebody who is holding up some other part of the fort.
1536620	1540620	That also makes it so difficult once you have this bond to give it up if it's not really working,
1540620	1546620	because it's going to break away an important part of your functionality that is difficult to recover.
1546620	1554620	I mean, Shailen and I have been together for 10 years at this point, and we're so intertwined.
1554620	1562620	And obviously it's like there's conflicts and there's things that you have to get through because that's life.
1562620	1566620	There's no opportunity to have somebody who's a perfect person, right?
1566620	1571620	And so they're always going to fail you in some number of ways. I fail, he fails, everybody fails.
1571620	1578620	And there is this tendency in the world to be like, well, failure is unacceptable and the relationship must end
1578620	1586620	with some really low baseline of failure, where people behave like it's better to walk away from something
1586620	1591620	than it is to stay and to work through it and to get dirty and to be vulnerable.
1591620	1597620	And I think that it can be really scary because, like you said, if you have a two year rough patch in a relationship,
1597620	1604620	that's a really, really long time. But at the same point, over the course of a life, is it really that long?
1604620	1611620	I think it was the price that we had to pay that basically it was her first relationship, she was 19.
1611620	1619620	And I was very of this because I thought she's going to change a lot in the next few years and I'm going to change somewhat.
1619620	1625620	And I was 23, but I'd been in relationships for seven years at that point.
1625620	1630620	And so I thought I've been through a lot of things and had made many of the transformations.
1630620	1638620	But how is this going to fit when she is a full adult? Does she still fit into this relationship or is she able to find a new fit?
1638620	1641620	And this is essentially what got us.
1641620	1649620	And so this realignment of accommodating a new person or a new pairing in a relationship, that was very difficult for us to achieve.
1649620	1656620	And there was really this big fear, do I still fit in or do I have to cut up an important part of myself if I stay in this relationship?
1656620	1663620	And that's also the other question. If you're a stage designer and you realize it's 40 nowadays and not really compatible with having kids,
1663620	1669620	do you choose kids and family or do you choose the career that you've been working for all your life?
1669620	1672620	That was also an important aspect.
1672620	1681620	Yeah, that's right on the front of our table right now as well. It's a very difficult road to navigate.
1681620	1684620	What did you end up determining there?
1684620	1694620	Well, we went for the kids and family. And for stage design, I think it is very hard to pull this off because the way it works in Germany
1694620	1703620	is that you have to be an assistant for many, many years and very few of the people who go to that route manage to become fully employed as a stage designer.
1703620	1712620	And so in Mira's class at Kunsthochschule Weissensee, which is one of the most prestigious places to study stage design for theater in Germany,
1712620	1718620	she was the best one. And almost all of her class dropped out at some point out of this career class.
1718620	1728620	And the two women who managed to get in did this by having relationships to other stage designers or to a director.
1728620	1736620	And so it didn't work like you have a family and on the side you have a career in the theater.
1736620	1743620	So that was pretty tough. And on the other hand, she felt, which we were surprised about Ami,
1743620	1750620	that when we had children and I said you're spending so much time with them, maybe find some solution to get a nanny or whatever.
1750620	1755620	And you do whatever you want. No, I want to spend that time with the children. I don't want to miss out on it.
1755620	1761620	It's the most important time in my life. And she did not experience this at a loss.
1761620	1768620	There was some thing that she felt I would wish there was a place for me to work professionally and to develop myself professionally.
1768620	1774620	But it was also given the choice. She chose the children also later on.
1774620	1784620	We had a philosopher on the show in the early days. I believe it was L.A. Paul who was talking about transformative experiences
1784620	1788620	and how you just don't have the information necessary to make that choice.
1788620	1793620	You don't know what your life, your new life is going to look like until it happens.
1793620	1796620	And I imagine children are the perfect example of that.
1796620	1801620	Because you're not the same person after you've gone through the experience.
1801620	1809620	And so you can't forecast onto the agent that you will be on the other side of it because you have no idea what the priorities of that agent will be.
1809620	1819620	And so you're always rolling the dice in the sense of is it worth trying to become someone else knowing that I will lose who I am today?
1819620	1826620	And I think that that's for women and children and child rearing that's often the case because I watched my sister go through this.
1826620	1833620	She just had kids. She's 40. And she was a professional.
1833620	1840620	She worked at Google for like 10 years. And then she decided that, OK, it was time to have kids.
1840620	1848620	But she was terrified that she would become someone for whom children were the center and she would lose all these other parts of herself.
1848620	1857620	And now that she has a child, I think that she recognizes that it's just this is better than anything that you can get out of a career.
1857620	1864620	Yes. I think that you basically feel that what you did before you had children was jumping up and down and looking at things.
1864620	1868620	And this stuff is not lost. It's there. It's a part of who you are still.
1868620	1875620	But you have additional layers that don't regulate this part when there's more important things.
1875620	1885620	And taking care of the next generation is suddenly the most important thing because you identify as a multigenerational being that is reaching from the first cell into the future.
1885620	1891620	And it's up to you right now if it ends here or if it continues and how.
1891620	1898620	So it's quite profound. And I found that I was worried that you would adjust your brain and become boring or anything or complacent.
1898620	1904620	And the opposite happened. She developed so much depth. And I never felt lonely in this relationship. I'm very grateful for this.
1904620	1916620	She didn't stop reading. She read a lot more. She developed much more in terms of psychology and self-awareness and people awareness and social thinking and also philosophy.
1916620	1926620	And it's quite profound. And she became a much more well-adjusted human being during the pregnancy because everything basically got adjusted and fell into place.
1926620	1932620	I think about that line of living beings from the very first cell all the way to us.
1932620	1939620	And I also think about it in terms of the spiritual wheel of life.
1939620	1948620	I think this is kind of like a Vedic cosmology a little bit where you continuously are reincarnated until you get to a point where you reach nirvana and you don't.
1948620	1956620	And I have this tendency of looking at life as this continuous process that actually reaches back before the first cell.
1956620	1961620	I was listening to your Lex Friedman podcast and I was surprised that you identified life with cells.
1961620	1974620	But I see it as this iterative process where I wonder if there is some kind of spiritual event that happens when you reach the point of reproduction and you decide against it.
1975620	1984620	Where it's a release of the burden because being human is really difficult. It's painful.
1984620	1991620	The poet William Blake addressed this head on and he treated it as the sin of generation.
1991620	2002620	He retells these ancient biblical narratives as if having children is actually getting in the way of spiritual enlightenment to some extent.
2002620	2006620	Not having children is spiritual suicide.
2006620	2007620	Can you elaborate?
2007620	2012620	We have no longer stake in the future of life.
2012620	2018620	It's only narrative now. You have ideas about how you contribute to the future, but you're actually no longer part of it.
2018620	2031620	I guess an artist is the one rare piece of society that is transforming future generations without generating more beings.
2031620	2042620	Your value as an artist is given by how much the audience appreciates you as broken to me, but maybe this is idiosyncratic to the type of artist family in which I grew up.
2042620	2051620	This idea that I have to adapt to the impact that I have on my environment is distorting my ability to do art.
2051620	2059620	As an artist, I am in some sense completely fine with having an audience of one or zero if the art that I'm doing is good.
2059620	2070620	It could be that what you're doing is reaching a large audience or a small audience, but in some sense that's incidental.
2070620	2072620	Okay, I agree with that.
2072620	2083620	But the other part is that there's plenty of people whose work becomes influential after death.
2083620	2093620	It's not that you're playing to an audience and you're performing this iterative loop of how will I make the tastiest Frito that somebody will buy,
2093620	2102620	but instead it's that you say something about the human condition that is so powerful that it persists in the world after you die.
2102620	2113620	The question is, if you're an artist, would I lose my ability to say those things if I had children and that was where my focus was?
2113620	2121620	Of course. This poem of the sacrifice has integrity to say I don't want to have children because art is more important to me.
2121620	2123620	There's nothing wrong with this.
2123620	2130620	There's also this possibility that only very few generations are left or we really don't give a shit about the future generations anymore
2130620	2140620	because millennials suck and zoomers are the worst and it doesn't get better after that.
2140620	2144620	I feel like every generation has said that about the previous generation.
2144620	2148620	It did, right? It did. And yet...
2148620	2153620	Here we are. It means we're getting old.
2153620	2156620	But look at them!
2156620	2165620	I was looking at the commercials for the new Apple Vision Pro and I look at these shit faces and there is nothing human in them.
2165620	2169620	It's just entirely uncanny valley.
2169620	2177620	It was crazy because, okay, full disclosure, my sister recently got laid off but my whole family works at Google.
2177620	2186620	My brother, his girlfriend, my dad, my mom doesn't, and my brother-in-law is in tech but not Google.
2186620	2193620	And so I'm terrified that the speciation event is running along this fracture line in my family
2193620	2196620	where they're all looking at this stuff and like, this is awesome!
2196620	2201620	And I'm sitting over here living in the middle of nowhere like, what are you doing?
2201620	2205620	How is this a vision of the world where you're wearing these goggles
2205620	2211620	and you're just constantly interfacing with a computer and you're not really there?
2211620	2218620	And it feels like there is a complete fracture in the entire world that runs along these lines
2218620	2223620	because you see people that see the demo and they're in love with it already
2223620	2226620	and they're the early adopters and they're full speed ahead.
2226620	2230620	And then you have the other people that are like, I don't know that that's where we want to go
2230620	2238620	because where does it end? It ends in optoneural implants that are given to you at birth basically
2238620	2247620	that will perpetually jack you into the system and I guess that's the cyborg future.
2247620	2252620	I don't see any other end to it. Where else could it possibly go?
2252620	2257620	I think you're too optimistic. I think it will probably be crap again.
2257620	2264620	This idea that we have something that creates a seamless interface between my imagination
2264620	2269620	and the physical world that I'm dropped into and I can mix and match.
2269620	2276620	That is, I think to me, a very powerful and liberating concept as long as I am the one who is in charge.
2276620	2281620	And I feel that it gives me a freedom to choose my environment.
2281620	2286620	I don't need to be on an airplane. I can be in a space that I create entirely for myself.
2286620	2290620	And I can create the inside of my mind.
2290620	2295620	And ideally, I want to have a product that is going to in deep resonance with my mind
2295620	2298620	that is so empathetic that it's able to read my thoughts.
2298620	2304620	So I can co-create with the substrate. I can extend myself into the substrate and I can enlarge my mind.
2304620	2308620	And to me, this technology is potentially a step in this direction.
2308620	2313620	I'm just not so optimistic they can pull it off because their taste seems to be so bad at this point.
2313620	2316620	I'm agnostic with respect to the type of product.
2316620	2323620	And I'm not ready yet to buy into a simplistic black and white black mirror narrative.
2323620	2326620	There is a lot of stuff that I can project into black mirror.
2326620	2333620	But there is also a lot of stuff that I can see in every decade that puts people into an alienating world
2333620	2340620	that happens to be physical and happens to be 3D and photons that have bounced off streets and walls and trees.
2340620	2342620	But that is also not satisfying.
2345620	2350620	I think what you said about it being of your own making is really important.
2350620	2361620	Because my first impression when I saw this technology drop was I have no interest in joining into somebody else's technological vision
2361620	2365620	of what my future imagination should look like.
2365620	2367620	So it's just not attractive to me personally.
2368620	2370620	But I could see it being attractive to lots of people.
2370620	2376620	But I'm interested in technology that's going to allow me, like you said, to be more of myself
2376620	2379620	and not somebody else's vision of myself.
2379620	2381620	And that's the fine line for me.
2381620	2385620	Unfortunately, the business case for our self-made software doesn't seem to be good.
2385620	2391620	Steve Jobs had the choice of building the Smalltalk universe where you can basically open the hood of every application
2391620	2396620	and applications share code across applications and you can change out everything in real time
2396620	2400620	everything becomes user accessible and user maintainable and user designable
2400620	2407620	versus a world where everything is closed boxes and even the developers can only open the box
2407620	2412620	if they have the pipeline open and have their source code and IDE tuned to this.
2412620	2419620	So even another developer from another company cannot open your hood and look under it and fix things and improve them.
2419620	2421620	This world has much better business cases.
2422620	2431620	I've been really struck recently by how difficult it is to work with the technology that we have
2431620	2435620	because the future was supposed to be this thing where everything is really streamlined
2435620	2439620	and the technology allows you to be more of yourself and to accomplish more.
2439620	2444620	And it's not. It's very clunky. It's difficult to navigate.
2444620	2454620	Anybody who's over the age of 60 maybe who isn't in high tech is basically screwed by their technology at this point.
2454620	2457620	It is opaque. It is unbelievably difficult.
2457620	2462620	I had this experience where Shiloh's dad flies radio controlled airplanes
2462620	2468620	and he needed to do a firmware update for his radio controller and he couldn't figure out how to do it.
2468620	2472620	So I was like, that's fine. I can I can troubleshoot stuff pretty easily.
2472620	2480620	It was unbelievable how many layers deep in the website this update was buried.
2480620	2486620	Layers of passwords, different portals. I think he had to put it on a USB stick at the end of the day.
2486620	2493620	It was just it was an unbelievable collection of steps where if he didn't have someone who could walk him through it,
2493620	2495620	there's no way that he would have figured it out.
2495620	2497620	See, that's why we need kids.
2498620	2505620	I would mostly give it to my 12 year old this task who would have joy puzzling it out.
2505620	2508620	Yeah, that's a really good point, actually.
2508620	2515620	You know, the tradition of having children to work for you is a long and storied tradition.
2515620	2519620	Especially to fix your printer, I remember.
2519620	2520620	I love that.
2520620	2525620	Further updates. Yeah. Shall we turn on the audio and recording?
2525620	2529620	Yeah, if you if you could. We've been recording this whole time, but I didn't know that.
2529620	2536620	So I will turn on the auto recording on my side as well, just to have a backup in case the Internet is not on our side.
2536620	2538620	Fantastic. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah.
2538620	2547620	If you want to just start off and orient people a bit to who you are and the project that you're working on right now, we'll just keep going.
2547620	2551620	Hello, Shiloh. Hello, Anastasia. Thank you for inviting me to your conversation.
2551620	2555620	I'm Joshua Bach. I'm a cognitive scientist and AI researcher.
2555620	2559620	And the reason why I went into this field is because I want to understand how the mind works.
2559620	2563620	That was actually the sole reason I went into academia in the first place.
2563620	2574620	And I tried to study lots of things that were related to this and tried to figure out how to identify those fields,
2574620	2579620	which had a meaningful opinion about how the mind works and could teach me something about it.
2579620	2584620	And I was not very successful at first to find something.
2584620	2590620	I did study math a little bit and computer science and psychology and a bit of physics.
2590620	2602620	And I found that psychology didn't offer me theories that I could work with that were matching the observable reality deeply enough to understand the deep questions.
2602620	2606620	What is consciousness? What is the mind? How does it relate to reality?
2606620	2617620	And philosophies seem to be stuck in discussing texts that they were reflecting, usually not at the same level at which the text was originally written.
2617620	2620620	And so I had the impression that most of the fields were stuck.
2620620	2625620	Neuroscience is mostly not about minds, it's about neurons and their individual structure.
2625620	2627620	The interactions of neurons are poorly understood.
2627620	2634620	There is no model of neuroscience that they can plug into a simulation and it produces interesting brain-like behavior yet.
2634620	2639620	And so the only hope that I saw existed in artificial intelligence.
2639620	2650620	And in some sense, artificial intelligence was started by Minsky and others to continue on the philosophical project of Leibniz and Frege and Wittgenstein to understand the mind by building one.
2650620	2661620	Basically closing the gap between mathematics and meaning by automating the structure that is breaking down meaning into chunks that can be computed.
2661620	2672620	And I realized that there has been a big constructivist turn in the last century that is largely under-adjusted by philosophy, which basically turned the concept of mathematics into computation.
2672620	2681620	Which said that all the mathematics that can be real, that can be implemented in the physical universe is characterized by moving from step to step.
2681620	2687620	And these transitions and systems that are moving from step to step, that's actually computation.
2687620	2692620	And physics, in a sense, is a computational science. The universe is a computational system.
2692620	2698620	Everything that is dynamic and deterministic can be described as the computational system.
2698620	2701620	And the indeterministic stuff is not different from this.
2701620	2707620	It's just, in addition, deleting some of the bits that you had computed before, if it's indeterministic.
2707620	2712620	So you're interested in the deterministic aspects of the whole thing.
2712620	2722620	And I guess it started for me as a child, when I was sitting in front of my combo drugs before, when realizing that everything that I could imagine, I could put behind that screen.
2722620	2727620	And I asked myself, what is it that I would want to put behind that screen, if I understand it clearly enough.
2727620	2732620	And I thought an entire world, of course, with minds in it that you can talk to.
2732620	2735620	And this was basically my project when I came into academia.
2735620	2741620	And this was what I was trying to study for and collecting ideas in my mind for and building structure for.
2741620	2750620	And then at some point, I interacted with the institutions deeply enough to understand that they wouldn't pay me for building a mind, at least not back then.
2750620	2763620	I think now the situation is better because AI has become much more fashionable, actually a hype in the sense that a lot of people are willing to invest into niche topics of AI.
2763620	2773620	And the philosophical project, which has always been an extremely niche topic, because it's something that is so risky as a philosophical project, that there's a very good chance that you're not going to succeed in your lifetime.
2773620	2778620	That is not the stuff that you could get paid for when I was in academia.
2778620	2783620	And so in some sense, for me, the question of where to pursue this best is still open.
2783620	2791620	Should we do this in a large company that is large enough to be able to put effort into niche topics like machine consciousness?
2791620	2805620	Or should we take the opportunity that we have right now that so many people are interested in doing this and just build a dedicated institution that studies nothing but how to teach a machine to be conscious?
2805620	2807620	Oh, go ahead.
2807620	2817620	I was going to say you said that the universe is fundamentally computational, but is that how it is or is that just a description?
2817620	2823620	And if it's just a description, is it necessarily the best description of the universe?
2823620	2825620	That's a metaphysical question.
2825620	2831620	And the very short answer is that I think for something to exist, it has to be implemented.
2831620	2837620	To be implemented and to exist are for me very basically identical concepts.
2837620	2839620	That's the way I understand existence.
2839620	2850620	And the part of the universe that can be described in any language that is not self-contradictory, that is constructive, that's computation.
2850620	2857620	And so if you think about computational objects, it means that you have a bunch of relationships between information.
2857620	2865620	And when that thing is causally relevant, so it interacts with an observer, for instance, and that includes the observer itself, it needs to be dynamic.
2865620	2869620	And so at the core of everything that exists is state transitions.
2869620	2872620	It's basically changes in information.
2872620	2876620	And the meaning of information is its relationship to change in other information.
2876620	2879620	It's a very general way to thinking about stuff.
2880620	2887620	And curiously, if we look at the entire history of science and metaphysics, it doesn't seem to be a viable alternative to this.
2887620	2898620	There's basically no other way to build representational systems in which I can think, talk, observe about anything or in which anything can be implemented to exist than computational frameworks.
2898620	2902620	So computation doesn't mean you have this particular von Neumann computer.
2902620	2904620	This is not a particular kind of machine.
2904620	2905620	It's more general than this.
2905620	2914620	The Church-Truing thesis basically says that all these systems in which we can define state transitions are ultimately equivalent to each other to the point where they run out of resources.
2916620	2927620	See, the way that I look at it, existence is a static concept, whereas dynamics and the patterns that emerge, the motions, those are all dynamic.
2927620	2928620	They're dynamical.
2928620	2938620	And so you have bodies, just these volumes, surface bound volumes with inward extension that are interacting in the material sense.
2938620	2943620	But the patterns that play out, the motions, all of these are on a completely different layer.
2943620	2946620	And the patterns don't exist in the same physical sense.
2946620	2948620	The substrate exists.
2948620	2950620	The rest is occurring, right?
2950620	2952620	These are occurrences because they're dynamic.
2952620	2956620	But in order to describe, say, a table, I don't need any dynamics to do it.
2957620	2968620	It just has an architecture and that defines its existence because it has, we can conceive of this body, the table, and it has a location with respect to all the other bodies in the room.
2968620	2970620	And so therefore it exists.
2970620	2983620	But if I want to start talking about what the table is and how it's used and what its function is, then I'm getting into this idea, this realm of ideas where we're talking about its dynamics with respect to everything else.
2983620	2987620	Its motion and its purpose and all of these other layers.
2987620	2997620	But fundamentally, the universe is a set of physical objects which are defined by being bodies with surfaces and inward extension.
2998620	3000620	That table is in prototype, right?
3000620	3010620	It's a way to structure your mental models of parts of reality in terms of giving you affordances of dealing with the reality around you.
3010620	3019620	If you look at the actual tables, there are arrangements of matter that can be captured by this type of model that you have of a table.
3019620	3027620	And I think it makes sense to treat tables not as physical objects, but as a way to relate to physical objects in your own mind.
3027620	3029620	It's a way to structure reality.
3029620	3035620	Reality can probably be understood as something like an evolving state vector, the universe itself.
3035620	3042620	And this evolving state vector cannot be experienced as a whole and it cannot be modeled in your mind as a whole.
3042620	3047620	You cannot make useful predictions based on the assumption that it's uniformly evolving state vector.
3047620	3056620	Instead, what you need to do is you take it apart into regions that are loosely coupled between each other and strongly coupled within.
3056620	3064620	And the table describes an arrangement of stuff that is strongly coupled within in the sense that you can take it apart, but then it stops being a table.
3064620	3073620	It's basically a function that you describe a part of the universe that changes more slowly than the rest of the universe with respect to you.
3073620	3075620	And that makes the universe manageable.
3075620	3081620	The interaction between such regions that we call objects that interact with each other, that is what we call causality.
3081620	3091620	And causality becomes a model property, a property of models that are derived by separating the universe into loosely coupled interacting objects.
3092620	3104620	Right. And I think that it's really important, at least in physics, that we don't get confused with the difference between objects and ideas.
3104620	3115620	Because when we start treating ideas as if we can move them around and perform dynamical operations on ideas, we get confused and we don't have a baseline.
3115620	3120620	It becomes a circular argument that has no substrate at some point.
3120620	3129620	And it seems like this is at the core of so many issues in physical sciences, because we haven't been able to separate them.
3129620	3142620	It doesn't get confused. Physics is solving this affair for itself very elegantly by restraining itself to the part of reality that can be described as short algebraic equations.
3143620	3152620	And everything else that doesn't fit into short algebraic equations, physicists ignore and they call it chemistry or biology, and it's being left to other people.
3152620	3158620	And so physics is a particular way of modeling the world, mostly using geometry.
3158620	3165620	Yes, but it's very new in the last hundred years or so that physics has become this purely mathematical discipline.
3165620	3172620	Prior to that, it was understood as a mechanical discipline that was bodies interacting with other bodies, either pushing or pulling on them.
3172620	3177620	And in some sense, I feel like that's a much more sane way of approaching it.
3177620	3186620	Because right now, physics is trying to absorb so many metaphysical problems when they're talking about the universe and the fate of the universe.
3186620	3193620	And they're very existential questions in some sense, and people are happy to look to the physicists for answers on those.
3193620	3201620	But I don't know that mathematics is equipped to answer cosmological questions of purpose, of meaning, of future.
3203620	3207620	To me, mathematics is the domain of all languages, of all the simple games.
3207620	3213620	And mathematicians start with the simplest one, formal languages, where you can define truth from the ground up.
3213620	3221620	Whereas when you try to talk about philosophical issues, you have to use natural languages because it's so hard to formalize them.
3221620	3228620	And that's why it's very hard to say something truthful in a natural language, because truth is so hard to define in all this ambiguity.
3228620	3241620	In mathematics, conversely, it's very hard to say something about the actual world that we are in, to talk about minds, feelings, emotions, interaction between people, the actual economy, and so on, actual objects.
3242620	3252620	But there has been progress, and this progress has been so profound that we can now use formal notations to describe many aspects of physics in a satisfying way.
3252620	3257620	And the mathematics is a tool for notation, for the most part.
3257620	3262620	And it has a similar relationship to the objects as notation has to musical objects.
3263620	3277620	When you think about music, you could say that music ultimately is about making noises and having ideas about these noises, and often describe the space of attitudes and movements in the space of attitudes, and some types of music.
3277620	3288620	It's about having different types of attitudes that find a resolution among each other, or sometimes it's the progressions with space of attitudes that gets you somewhere or constructs something interesting.
3288620	3301620	There are different types of music applying with this. There are also musics that do not really work on attitudes, but on other types of mathematical objects, but ultimately music is about some kind of mathematics.
3301620	3317620	And music itself is relatively easy to find a notation for. You can write it down at a very young age, and you can use it to talk to other people about the music that is in your mind, and you can also use it to talk to yourself about the music in your mind.
3317620	3322620	And there is an additional layer that is not captured by the notation that allows you to interpret it.
3322620	3336620	So the notation is to some degree constraining the piece that you are playing, and the actual art consists in the interpretation of the piece and to building additional structure in which you build a relationship to the piece.
3336620	3341620	So it's not just this media thing, but it's the deviation from the default that becomes interesting.
3341620	3351620	And physics in the sense is not an art like this, but it has made progress in finding notation for geometrical and dynamical affairs that are happening.
3351620	3358620	And it's harder to learn this notation. Typically you need to spend a decade to get the basics down.
3358620	3368620	So you can describe all the objects that physicists are talking about and understand their notations, but it's a similar thing. There is nothing alienating about the languages of physics.
3368620	3372620	It's just that these languages are also not capable of talking about stuff like consciousness.
3372620	3378620	So how do I find a notation that allows me to truthfully talk about mental phenomena?
3378620	3382620	And this is something that's interesting to me. So basically how can I mathematics this as well?
3382620	3389620	How can I find a way to actually reflect about it and make proofs about it and communicate about it?
3389620	3396620	I worry that something is lost when we treat mathematics as a language because it's essentially quantitative adverbs.
3396620	3399620	And it's hard to imagine making a sentence out of quantitative adverbs.
3399620	3406620	Whenever you read, you know, we were talking before we started, I just published a paper today which is highly mathematical,
3406620	3413620	but it also has a lot of companion text which qualifies the mathematics and explains what the formula mean.
3413620	3417620	It almost seems to me like mathematics alone has no explanatory power.
3417620	3424620	It can only describe how a system behaves, but it's on the real language, say English in this case,
3424620	3432620	to qualify what that description means about the cause and effect relationship.
3432620	3435620	And I probably came from a different direction at the same problem.
3435620	3438620	And I think it started with computing.
3438620	3444620	When I was a kid, I was blessed with having this weird Commodore 64 that has no way to talk about geometry.
3444620	3448620	I guess basic programming language is very similar to assembler in there.
3448620	3453620	And it doesn't have a command to draw a line or even draw a pixel on the screen.
3453620	3459620	So the way in which you draw a line is that you poke a few values directly into registers of the video chip.
3459620	3466620	You need to know these addresses and the values that you need to poke in to make the video chip forget how to render characters on the screen
3466620	3470620	and instead interpret a part of the memory as a pixel arrangement.
3470620	3477620	And a few choices that you can make of whether a pixel is composed of one bit or multiple bits.
3477620	3480620	So you can have multiple colors or just two colors.
3480620	3487620	And when you make it out of one bit, it means that one byte arrangement of eight bits is going to be mapped into eight pixels.
3487620	3490620	And a group of these eight bytes is a block.
3490620	3498620	And then the block starts next to it and you have 40 of these blocks in every line and you have, I think, 24 blocks vertically.
3498620	3508620	And so you can come up with a formula that you derive by yourself that tells you how to find a bit in memory that corresponds to a pixel on the screen.
3508620	3512620	And once you've done this, you can create a loop that draws a line on the screen.
3512620	3515620	It's a major triumph when you figure out that puzzle.
3515620	3521620	And so in some sense, I was able as a child to derive geometry in this way.
3521620	3524620	I wrote a graphics program for myself because I didn't have one.
3524620	3527620	It was 1983, 84.
3527620	3531620	I was in Eastern Germany for a software that I wanted to have for the Commodore 64.
3531620	3533620	It either didn't exist or was not accessible.
3533620	3538620	So I wrote a program that could draw lines and that could draw ellipses and so on and combined them.
3538620	3540620	It's my first graphics program.
3540620	3545620	And to do this, I had to derive geometry by hand, the mathematics of geometry.
3545620	3547620	And I did not realize that I was doing this.
3547620	3552620	I thought mathematicians have some secret way of doing this that is much more elegant than what I was doing.
3552620	3557620	And the Commodore 64 also gives you an idea of how this happens in the CPU.
3557620	3571620	So we realize that all the mathematics that happens in the CPU, all the basic Boolean logic and also the basic arithmetic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is done with some pattern matching operation.
3571620	3578620	It's basically a hashing function that is taking input pattern and maps it to an output pattern in a regular way using a simple circuit.
3578620	3587620	And so you realize how you can build up the entirety of mathematics, including geometry, including everything that you can see in a world and display in a computer game.
3587620	3594620	By dynamic objects interacting with each other, agents that reason about what they're seeing in this world and how they're interacting with you.
3594620	3603620	All the stuff that we see right now in computer games and increasing degrees of resolution is built up from these tiny, simple automata.
3603620	3606620	So you realize that all of mathematics is being built like this.
3606620	3613620	It starts out with finite automata and using a suitable set of finite automata is an axiomatic system.
3613620	3616620	You can build anything that you can imagine.
3616620	3620620	And there is, in my way, nothing that you cannot put into a computer.
3620620	3623620	I wouldn't know what that should be.
3623620	3627620	There is nothing in physics that you cannot recreate in a computer.
3627620	3638620	Some of the stuff quantum mechanics is not going to run efficiently on your computer or rather the particles that you own by a quantum mechanics are not going to run efficiently.
3638620	3650620	Because I think that ultimately the premise of quantum mechanics is that the particle universe in which we are conceptualizing and perceiving ourselves is inefficiently implemented on the substrate.
3651620	3659620	So there's one aspect of this, which is that there's a difference between physics and biology.
3659620	3661620	Right?
3661620	3663620	Well, yes.
3663620	3667620	And the difference is that biology emerges over the dynamics of evolved cells.
3667620	3671620	The biocell is itself an agent.
3671620	3680620	It's a system that is in some sense a very complicated super molecule that is able to model aspects of the future.
3680620	3694620	And most of these models are formed implicitly through a process of evolving for a particular kind of environment and then putting subroutines into the genome of the cell that allows the cell to deal with lots and lots of different environmental circumstances
3694620	3700620	that would destroy a similarly complicated and fragile molecule without that kind of regulation.
3700620	3712620	So basically the cell is able to deal with more complicated environments and survive in them, keep its structure stable due to its ability to regulate aspects of the future visits in built dynamics.
3713620	3726620	And in order for that to happen, the cell needs to combine a way to harvest entropy, neck entropy from the universe, basically get the energy that it needs to survive, keep its structure stable against disturbances.
3726620	3728620	And it needs to have a computer.
3728620	3733620	It's basically DNA with the right head, very similar to a chewing machine.
3733620	3736620	And it needs to have a way to self-replicate.
3736620	3740620	And without any of these components, life is not possible.
3740620	3741620	And they're quite complex.
3741620	3751620	Each of them is built by physical structures, but our biogenesis, how to get from the first cell from something that is not biological is very hard to understand.
3751620	3753620	There are some people who are optimistic about that.
3753620	3758620	You just put the right conditions in some kind of primordial soup and cells are going to pop right out.
3758620	3760620	But there is no proof of this.
3760620	3764620	We can get reasonably complex organic molecules, but so far not cells.
3764620	3766620	And so maybe cells are everywhere in the universe.
3766620	3776620	And maybe we are in the only place in the universe where the cells have formed or that has been infected by cells that formed somewhere else in our solar system under more favorable conditions.
3776620	3781620	Maybe cells really require some freakish accident for them to happen.
3781620	3785620	But once you have cells, biology is easy because you get evolution.
3786620	3814620	I think that I object to the idea that the definition of life is a cell, because I think that I define life as a form of matter that's able to desire things and then to change the world to fit its desires.
3815620	3819620	And I think that that process begins before you get a cell.
3819620	3832620	I think that the cell is the manifestation of progressively more complex organizations of matter that are able to change the future by virtue of existing.
3832620	3843620	I'm not sure if I'm willing to attribute desire to cells even, and probably not to processes before cells.
3843620	3845620	I don't think that the virus is desire.
3845620	3852620	I think of a virus as something like a text fragment that the cell cannot help but read and to enact its code.
3852620	3855620	And I don't think that the virus itself is multistable.
3855620	3857620	And so it's not actually living.
3857620	3865620	It's not able to survive without injecting itself into a cell that is producing all the necessary dynamics to make the virus function in the way it does.
3865620	3875620	And there is nothing simpler than a cell that is performing these functions and its arrangement of cells that give rise to systems that represent themselves.
3875620	3885620	And I think that desire is a property of a system that observes itself desiring, that has a concept of itself wanting something.
3885620	3890620	It's not just an implementation of a thermostat that is trying to keep the temperature stable.
3890620	3894620	I don't think that the thermostat has a desire in this regard.
3894620	3900620	And I also don't think that there is something magical that needs to be added to the thermostat to turn it into an agent.
3900620	3903620	It's basically all just functionality that needs to be added.
3903620	3907620	But desire is the property of systems that represent their own agency.
3908620	3920620	It seems like, again, I think if I can clarify what Anastasia is getting at is that there seems to be a confusion again between the idea of life,
3920620	3929620	which is a phenomenon, and the objects which exhibit the phenomenon, which is the organism, the cell, right?
3930620	3939620	Well, yeah, because you say that it's not possible for a cell that can't conceptualize itself to have a desire.
3939620	3947620	Yes, to some degree agnostic with respect to this, because I have no proof for the upper bound of the complexity of a cell.
3947620	3954620	I don't know if there could be cells which think and which perceive in a meaningful sense.
3954620	3956620	I think it's conceivable that some do.
3956620	3964620	But I suspect that there are cells which are rather dumb and quite mechanical in their interaction with the world.
3964620	3973620	I find it fascinating that you seem to think that life is something that exists independently of the structures that implement it.
3973620	3978620	It's almost as if your ideas, your concepts that you form by observing lots of things,
3979620	3986620	are breaking free from your observations and develop an inner life and run amok in your mind.
3987620	3989620	Are you sure that you should leave them off the leash?
3989620	3995620	Because the life that you're talking about is an abstraction that is ultimately always bound to observations that you made.
3995620	4002620	And I don't think that you were able to observe the phenomena of life outside of anything that has been constructed of or by cells.
4003620	4011620	Well, I think that cells are the natural progression of this kind of organization of matter.
4011620	4019620	And this is kind of reaching back to the idea of the Alain Vital, the idea that there's some animating force.
4019620	4024620	And we abandoned it because it seemed too spooky and religious.
4024620	4027620	No, no. We abandoned it because there was no evidence for it.
4028620	4032620	It was an idea to describe why stuff is animated and is moving.
4032620	4034620	It was not that anybody had ever observed it.
4035620	4037620	But so my point is this.
4037620	4045620	OK, so we have a vision of the origin of life that is cellular in nature.
4045620	4048620	Life begins when the first cell forms.
4048620	4055620	And we can't solve that problem because there's no way for us to bring together the components of cells and then to produce a cell.
4056620	4059620	And do you know Michael Levin? Do you know his work?
4059620	4060620	Yes.
4060620	4070620	And one of the things that he always says is he's like, look, the strength of your scientific philosophy has to do with what it allows you to accomplish.
4070620	4083620	And for decades now, we've had this way of looking at the cell as or of an organism as being the product of molecule target interactions,
4083620	4085620	where you have molecules that interact with receptors.
4085620	4087620	Those receptors come into the cell. They do something.
4087620	4091620	It's this very mechanistic ratchet machine, right?
4091620	4094620	You can simplify it to a bunch of gears that are all spinning.
4094620	4096620	And so it's a machine that has outputs.
4096620	4098620	But he has a radically different way of looking at it, right?
4098620	4102620	He's like, look, the thing that drives life is will, it's desire.
4102620	4107620	And so if we can control the desire of the cells by giving them the proper input,
4107620	4115620	since we understand what it is that the map between input and desire, then we can get them to do crazy things.
4115620	4118620	And he accomplishes this with his regenerative medicine experiments,
4118620	4124620	where he can make the body plan of these planarians change without affecting the DNA.
4124620	4134620	And the fact that you can do that to me suggests that our concept of life as cells isn't fully fleshed out.
4134620	4143620	Because if you have a state of matter that is, you know, gas, solid, liquid, plasma life,
4143620	4151620	then the problem of how cells arise becomes a question of how does matter organize itself
4151620	4159620	in isolated conditions that propagate iteratively towards the production of a stable body
4159620	4163620	that is then more effective than the molecules themselves.
4165620	4171620	And to say where that might be happening,
4171620	4177620	there's a lot of research into the deep biosphere that suggests that
4177620	4182620	there's a layer of the earth that you can go down deep enough into
4182620	4187620	where the line between chemistry and cells is blurred.
4187620	4192620	And these are really, really hard experiments to do,
4192620	4198620	because the people who have done them historically have been going into mines in South Africa,
4198620	4205620	five miles deep into the ground, finding these weird communities at the bottom of boreholes.
4205620	4208620	And it's really difficult work to do.
4208620	4213620	And so no one's been able to really map that line of,
4213620	4221620	hey, where does chemistry transition into biological molecules and then biological molecules into cells?
4221620	4228620	Because our technological ability still lags behind the questions that we ask.
4228620	4231620	It's a very, very difficult thing to do on a biological level,
4231620	4233620	if you're applying the tools of biology,
4233620	4242620	to be able to map the line between molecules, complexity, and cells.
4243620	4251620	This kind of thinking is a lot too vague for me.
4251620	4254620	I think you need to be much more concrete.
4254620	4258620	In my conversation with Michael Levin, he did not attribute the bill to cells,
4258620	4261620	and maybe this is because he didn't get around to it.
4261620	4266620	The way in which he characterizes the interaction between cells might include something like
4266620	4271620	individual cells are not performing a particular task,
4271620	4276620	because they are mechanically forced to, but because they are bullied by the environment into this particular task.
4276620	4281620	Not so much unlike an individual in a society fulfilling a very specialized role,
4281620	4285620	in large part because the environment bullies them into it so they can survive.
4285620	4288620	They need to find a niche and adapt to it and specialize.
4288620	4291620	And this is a similarity to how the cells behave.
4291620	4296620	And the cells behave like this because they have enough degrees of freedom,
4296620	4300620	as per their genetics, to find a specialization, giving the right environment.
4300620	4305620	And not all cell types are able to do this and will not be able to survive under these conditions.
4305620	4307620	It's still all very mechanical.
4307620	4312620	And when we talk about will in the context of cells, the question is, are you using a metaphor?
4312620	4318620	And more importantly, when you talk about will outside of the context of cells, are you still using a metaphor?
4318620	4320620	Or do you actually know what it means?
4320620	4324620	Are you able to formalize your understanding of what it means for a system to have a will?
4324620	4328620	Do you understand what it means for a system to desire something?
4328620	4331620	Can you break this down to those basic components?
4331620	4337620	What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to have a will or for something to have a desire?
4337620	4344620	I think I can because we talked to Karl Friston and our conversation with Karl Friston was kind of about this,
4344620	4349620	where his concept of the free energy principle, I think, outlines this.
4349620	4353620	And then we talked to this guy, Brett Kagan, who built this thing at Cortical Labs,
4353620	4357620	which is a chip with neurons on it that they trained to play Pong.
4357620	4359620	Did you see this?
4359620	4360620	Okay.
4360620	4364620	So do you want to try to find a will or desire?
4364620	4370620	Yeah, I think that will or desire is so organisms, cells, whatever you want to call it,
4370620	4376620	life has a way of pattern matching expectation to reality.
4376620	4383620	And when expectation and reality align, then there is equilibrium.
4383620	4393620	But when expectations and reality are misaligned, will is the process by which those are brought back into alignment.
4393620	4397620	And life is the only thing that can do that, I think.
4397620	4402620	Shaila is cheering. I appreciate that, Shaila.
4402620	4407620	I just think we have to be really, really careful here to separate out the physical bodies,
4407620	4412620	the organisms from the phenomenon, the occurrence of life,
4412620	4421620	which is what is on the table in terms of perhaps occurring at a level prior to the organisms themselves,
4421620	4423620	which is, I think, what Anastasia is talking about.
4423620	4426620	I mean, I think it really comes down to do you believe in hypotheses?
4426620	4429620	Do you think hypotheses are a necessary part of understanding the universe?
4430620	4437620	Because these are things which, in Descartes' definition, are sufficient to prove the theory,
4437620	4440620	but are not necessarily assumed to be true.
4440620	4443620	So you have to make these leaps like, well, it's possible.
4443620	4447620	It really comes down to whether it's possible or not when you're generating hypotheses.
4447620	4456620	Is it possible that this fundamental phenomenon, life, is occurring at other levels
4456620	4459620	besides the ones that we have empirically observed?
4459620	4465620	The simple question is, can the words that you're using do the work that you are assigning to them?
4465620	4470620	When you say life, you are referring to a conceptual structure,
4470620	4473620	and the conceptual structure needs to refer to causal structure.
4473620	4478620	And the causal structure needs to interact with all the other components of your model of the universe.
4478620	4483620	And when I say life and I say itself,
4483620	4488620	I don't mean that there are no other equivalent structures in the universe that behave in a similar way to cells.
4488620	4490620	I'm completely open to that.
4490620	4496620	I can also simulate stuff in a computer that behaves a lot like cells and has similar qualities.
4496620	4501620	When I decide to not call this life, then it's a terminological decision.
4501620	4504620	It's not some deep philosophical statement that I'm making.
4504620	4508620	Just when I think about what biologists have been studying when they talked about life
4508620	4511620	and they pointed into nature and stuff moving in there,
4511620	4513620	they were very puzzled about what it was.
4513620	4516620	And at some point, they reached a tacit agreement.
4516620	4519620	And this tacit agreement is really the dynamics of cells.
4519620	4523620	And viruses are not included because they are below that level.
4523620	4530620	And a car, for instance, is built by an arrangement of cells, but itself is not life.
4530620	4532620	Even if the car is self-driving, it's not a life.
4532620	4534620	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
4534620	4537620	And even if the car would be self-reproducing, it would not be a life according to most biologists.
4537620	4540620	And if you were to try to change that definition, you can do this.
4540620	4542620	And maybe you find it helpful in some contexts.
4542620	4549620	And just make sure that you still keep a word that allows you to talk about the dynamic of cells.
4549620	4555620	It's insanely conceivable that there is stuff that is indistinguishable from what biological cells are doing on Earth
4555620	4559620	that are not based on carbon, but that use completely different chemistry.
4559620	4563620	Maybe there are other solutions for building stuff that is cell-like.
4563620	4568620	And there might also be solutions for building self-organizing systems
4568620	4572620	that adapt to changing circumstances via evolution or construction.
4572620	4578620	And they could also maybe not be based on some membrane with self-replicators,
4578620	4581620	but maybe there is some other principle that makes them possible.
4581620	4585620	And whether we call this life or not ultimately is not important.
4585620	4591620	Just make sure that we are pointing at the right thing or at the same thing when we are using the word.
4591620	4593620	That is not an issue for me.
4593620	4595620	So this is not where we deviate.
4595620	4600620	But when you say that control is will, then I have a disagreement with you.
4600620	4606620	Because what you described with respect to a system that measures a deviation from some kind of target value
4606620	4611620	and when there is a deviation, it's unfolding a dynamic to reduce this deviation.
4611620	4613620	There is a name for this. It's called control.
4613620	4615620	And the thermostat has that already.
4615620	4617620	And I wouldn't say that the thermostat has will.
4617620	4622620	That is basically putting too much depth into what the thermostat is doing.
4622620	4625620	Because if a person would be acting like a thermostat,
4625620	4629620	I would not say that this person is acting out of a desire or is a will.
4629620	4631620	It could be also compulsion.
4631620	4637620	There are many ways in which people do things that are directed on a goal that are unrelated to desire and will.
4637620	4639620	Desire and will are much more specific terms.
4639620	4642620	And I wouldn't want to mash them up.
4642620	4646620	Another thing that is important is trace where a term comes from
4646620	4651620	and not necessarily where it comes from in the outer genealogy of scholarship.
4651620	4654620	But where does it come from in your own mind?
4654620	4657620	At which point did you form this concept?
4657620	4660620	What does this concept actually refer to in your own mind?
4660620	4661620	Reverse engineer this.
4661620	4666620	Break this down into actual observables and generalizations over observables.
4666620	4668620	That is for me the way in which I think.
4668620	4675620	So when I talk about will, I talk about a phenomenon that exists from the perspective of a willed observer
4675620	4678620	or of some observer who is observing a similar dynamic.
4678620	4680620	You can't use the word in the definition.
4680620	4682620	You can't use the word in the definition.
4682620	4684620	So define will without using will.
4684620	4686620	I think you can do it.
4686620	4693620	Will is a representation of an intention that is upstream from the self.
4693620	4696620	There are some slight differences.
4696620	4701620	There are people which have will outside of their self and there are some people which have it inside of their self.
4701620	4705620	What happens in this difference is that when you have will outside of yourself,
4706620	4711620	you experience yourself wanting something, but you don't have control over what you want.
4711620	4715620	You are just the thing that is tasked with making that happen.
4715620	4718620	So you are forced by your will to do things.
4718620	4721620	There is a part outside of your control, it's still outside of your mind,
4721620	4727620	that is producing an intention that is directing your behavior that something is committed to.
4727620	4732620	And that typically is happening in the service of some control task
4732620	4735620	that your mind has established with respect to the environment.
4735620	4742620	But what's crucial about the will is this internal representation in which you experience it as a motive force
4742620	4744620	that you have to resolve.
4744620	4747620	There is another sense in which will can exist.
4747620	4751620	Some people do not seem to experience this will outside of themselves,
4751620	4756620	but instead what they experience is pleasure and pain and purposes.
4756620	4761620	And then they have to find a goal by themselves to resolve the pleasure and pain
4761620	4764620	and to realize appetence and avoid aversion.
4764620	4769620	And so the will is something that is created inside of the reflexive mind,
4769620	4772620	this motive force that keeps them going.
4772620	4776620	But it's mostly a redirection of pleasure and pain into action.
4776620	4780620	And so in some sense there are different architectures of the self
4780620	4784620	on top of the mental architecture of control that we have
4784620	4788620	that give rise to different types of understanding will
4788620	4791620	and different notions of will that we observe in different psychologies.
4791620	4795620	But will is always something that seems to be dependent on an observer
4795620	4798620	that is conceptualizing a self-model.
4798620	4802620	And it exists with respect to that self.
4802620	4805620	I'm not sure if the self has a self-model.
4805620	4810620	I guess that even if some might do, which I somewhat doubt I don't have evidence for it,
4810620	4813620	the majority of cells probably don't have a self-model.
4813620	4817620	So cells are giant PID controllers in your world
4817620	4822620	and only the assembly of them allows for the emergence of will?
4822620	4827620	I think that cells are not coupled richly enough to the environment
4827620	4832620	to make it necessary for conceptualizing their own agency
4832620	4835620	from the perspective of an observer.
4835620	4840620	So the cell can probably for the most part perform its actions
4840620	4844620	without building explicit representations about them.
4844620	4848620	And especially not advanced representations like their own agency.
4848620	4852620	So they're acting entirely under that external will paradigm?
4852620	4855620	No, there is not necessarily a will involved.
4855620	4859620	They're just mechanical in the same way as a thermostat.
4859620	4864620	You said something really interesting, which is that you don't think that cells
4864620	4868620	are sufficiently coupled to their external environment.
4868620	4871620	I come at this from a microbiology perspective.
4871620	4876620	So I did my PhD in biofilms and specifically in electrical signaling in biofilms.
4876620	4879620	And so we studied these little molecules called phenosines
4879620	4883620	that change their oxidative state and they get shuttled around the biofilm.
4883620	4893620	And the state of their oxidation is informing gene transcription, cell behavior, everything.
4893620	4896620	So you have this complex system inside the biofilm
4896620	4901620	that is mediated by electrical signaling.
4901620	4906620	And you put that in front of somebody and they're like, well, that's just cells doing stuff.
4906620	4910620	But I'm like, to me, that seems that if you run that program for long enough,
4910620	4915620	you end up organically at multicellularity and bodies
4915620	4918620	and progressively more and more complex systems.
4918620	4924620	And everybody's always looking for the place where, like, where does this quality evolve?
4924620	4926620	Where does this quality appear?
4926620	4931620	At what point of complexity does it suddenly come into being that you can have will?
4931620	4938620	And my thought is that the will exists in a really simple rudimentary form inside of those cells,
4938620	4941620	the bacteria that are tightly coupled to their environment.
4941620	4945620	They have so much information coming into them.
4945620	4949620	And the set point that is maintained inside of them is so much more complicated than a thermostat.
4949620	4954620	Like, have you ever looked at a diagram of cellular metabolism in a bacteria
4954620	4959620	that can use, like, 15 different substrates to grow off of?
4959620	4962620	I have no doubt that it's complex.
4962620	4964620	The question is if there is a representation.
4964620	4968620	And I think for a will, you need a second order representation.
4968620	4972620	Basically, you need something that is conceptualizing itself as an agent
4972620	4974620	and is observing itself doing that.
4974620	4978620	You need to have some kind of reflexive self model to have will.
4978620	4979620	It's a technical definition.
4979620	4981620	There is nothing normative involved.
4981620	4985620	It's not that I require something to reach the magical complexity barrier.
4985620	4988620	I require it to have a particular causal structure.
4988620	4993620	And I am open to the possibility that cells might turn out having such causal structure.
4993620	4994620	That's not the point.
4994620	5001620	Just read Greg Beer's book, Blood Music, and it's written in the 1980s.
5001620	5005620	It's a science fiction novel that is absolutely brilliant, but it's terribly written.
5005620	5007620	It reads like doctor's fiction.
5007620	5010620	So the style of writing is almost unbearable to me.
5010620	5012620	It's like Asimov.
5012620	5016620	But the idea is brilliant.
5016620	5022620	And he basically describes the end game of AGI taking over the planet,
5022620	5025620	but he describes it via biotech.
5025620	5030620	It starts out with some guy in San Diego reading lymphocytes
5030620	5035620	that have the ability to make their DNA read right
5035620	5039620	and have a feedback loop through the RNA and in this way wake up
5039620	5042620	because they become self-editing and general function approximators.
5042620	5045620	And then he trains them to solve labyrinths
5045620	5050620	and gets the individual lymphocytes to the intellectual level of a mouse.
5050620	5055620	And then he is forced to stop the experiments because his employer doesn't want him to.
5055620	5060620	And he carries the experiment home by injecting his own modified lymphocytes back into his body
5060620	5064620	and turning Armageddon.
5064620	5068620	Okay, so immediately from a scientific perspective,
5068620	5072620	I don't think that you can get the lymphocyte to solve the maze.
5072620	5076620	But if you trigger the lymphocyte to turn into a multicellular organism,
5076620	5078620	then you probably could.
5078620	5082620	Because what you need in order to reach that kind of solving complexity
5082620	5093620	is an interrelated set of modules that are able to feed back onto each other
5093620	5100620	and then to get many pieces of information about the real external state
5100620	5103620	versus the thing that they want.
5103620	5108620	Yes, I agree. There are multiple issues with this story that he wrote.
5108620	5113620	The one that you're pointing at is, of course, he made his labyrinths extremely small.
5113620	5117620	And he built it in such a way that the receptors of the cell are sufficient
5117620	5121620	to get a sense of the environment in the labyrinths and they can navigate it.
5121620	5125620	But of course, there is the difference because the mouse is using optical sensors
5125620	5127620	in addition to touch.
5127620	5130620	And so the mouse is able to see over a large distance
5130620	5134620	in a way that is more difficult for a cell to achieve because it doesn't really have eyes.
5134620	5137620	And even if it has photoreceptors that are somewhat directional,
5137620	5139620	it's not going to get anywhere close to eyes.
5139620	5143620	So it's going to be difficult for the cell to make a model of space
5143620	5147620	at the same speed as the mouse would be doing it.
5147620	5150620	And the other one that is more profound, I think,
5150620	5154620	is that Greg Beer overestimates the capabilities of the mechanical computer
5154620	5156620	built inside of the cell.
5156620	5159620	So basically, even if you speed this up and give it more memory and so on,
5159620	5163620	it's still going to be awfully slow.
5163620	5167620	And it's because you cannot really parallelize what's going on in the individual cell
5167620	5170620	in the same way as you can parallelize stuff in the brain.
5170620	5173620	So you can deal with the fact that the brain is awfully slow,
5173620	5177620	but the brain is faster than the operations on DNA and RNA
5177620	5180620	And the reason for this, just sending a signal through cells,
5180620	5184620	is built in such a way that the cell only needs to trigger an internal switch
5184620	5189620	that's much faster than performing read-write operations internally.
5189620	5193620	The cell is also performing some read-write operations while it does that,
5193620	5195620	but it does not need to wait for the result.
5195620	5198620	It's able to do this on the site and offline and is fine
5198620	5202620	with these results being available with the delay of hundreds of milliseconds maybe
5202620	5205620	or at least tens of milliseconds or sometimes seconds.
5205620	5209620	The signal can pass quickly enough and gets modulated in the right way
5209620	5211620	almost instantaneously.
5211620	5214620	And still the brain is working at roughly the speed of sound
5214620	5220620	rather than an appreciable fraction of the speed of light as computers do
5220620	5222620	that we are building.
5222620	5226620	So I think the capabilities of even a really pumped-up cell
5226620	5230620	are going to be far below the capabilities of even a nervous system.
5231620	5233620	And I might be wrong.
5233620	5237620	So it might be missing possibilities of what can be created
5237620	5241620	in the chemistry of a cell in terms of computation.
5241620	5245620	And for instance, Lee Cronin has his big hopes for computation
5245620	5250620	of building Turing machines entirely out of chemical operations
5250620	5253620	without having mechanical parts in a sense.
5253620	5256620	And he hopes that he can make them much faster.
5257620	5260620	It's to read a very interesting open empirical question
5260620	5262620	how fast this can go.
5262620	5265620	But what we see is that the smarter organisms on the planet
5265620	5270620	are typically many, many cells that have particular metabolic enhancements
5270620	5274620	for making these cells work very fast and send information very quickly
5274620	5278620	so they can perform rich computations about the world.
5278620	5281620	And this being coupled means that you have many sensors
5281620	5285620	that are working in many modalities quite reliably with a lot of redundancy
5285620	5289620	over large distances where you see meaningful differences in the world
5289620	5291620	about which you want to integrate.
5295620	5300620	When I look at the AI landscape, I use a number of the AI tools in my daily life.
5300620	5305620	I sense nothing even approximating life in them.
5305620	5309620	I sense no sense of this will, for lack of a better word.
5309620	5313620	No sense of the ability to actually come up with new ideas.
5313620	5318620	The ability to conceptualize seems highly unique to life itself.
5318620	5321620	They're very useful in assisting me when I have an idea
5321620	5326620	and I know how to execute it and I can get assistance.
5326620	5334620	But when I hear these futuristic visions of this artificial general intelligence,
5334620	5340620	it doesn't seem like a natural leap from what I see in the world today
5340620	5342620	being called artificial intelligence.
5342620	5347620	It doesn't seem like a steady linear evolution.
5347620	5348620	Am I missing something?
5348620	5352620	Is there something incredible going on behind the scenes that I'm not aware of?
5352620	5355620	I guess if I were sitting down with a few computer scientists
5355620	5357620	and we were pointing at philosophers and we would say,
5357620	5361620	there's nothing in this realm which reminds me of life.
5361620	5363620	There's nothing creative there.
5363620	5369620	There is no meaningful interaction with the world in which we interact.
5369620	5373620	You could say that from some angle and some abstraction
5373620	5376620	to some projection that you can make, that's approximately true.
5376620	5380620	But if you were a philosopher, you'd probably think it's grossly unfair.
5380620	5384620	Hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to clarify that.
5384620	5387620	Because what Shiloh is saying is he's saying that
5387620	5390620	in the process of interacting with the tools
5390620	5392620	and the kinds of responses that you get,
5392620	5394620	there's something about talking to a human being
5394620	5396620	where you say something that's imperfect
5396620	5400620	and that being can understand what it is that you're saying,
5400620	5406620	integrate it, match it onto something that is outside of your experience
5406620	5407620	and build upon it.
5407620	5411620	And so if you were interacting with someone,
5411620	5415620	there's always the feeling that there's life there.
5415620	5418620	And it would be hard to interact with another human being
5418620	5421620	and walk away thinking that there's no life there.
5421620	5425620	But you can interact with a computer program, I think is what Shiloh is saying.
5425620	5428620	I think it all hinges on the ability to conceptualize.
5428620	5432620	And what I mean by that is the most primary form of concept
5432620	5435620	is a physical concept where two bodies are interacting,
5435620	5437620	say one body crashes into another.
5437620	5442620	But from there, you can get higher levels of conceptualization
5442620	5445620	which terminate in these things we call ideas.
5445620	5448620	And nobody really knows where ideas come from.
5448620	5451620	Obviously, if you're a theorist or an artist or whatever,
5451620	5454620	you have this experience that an idea just hits you all of a sudden.
5454620	5456620	And when you're having a conversation with a human being,
5456620	5459620	you're often generating ideas between the two of you.
5459620	5463620	But I've never had anything approximating that experience with an AI interaction.
5463620	5468620	I don't sense that they have the ability or will ever have the ability to conceptualize.
5468620	5471620	How do you know that nobody knows where ideas come from?
5471620	5475620	Maybe you can tell me where ideas come from.
5475620	5479620	I have an impression that I can usually trace where my ideas come from.
5479620	5481620	Interesting.
5481620	5490620	I write a lot of music and occasionally a piece of music will come to me fully formed.
5490620	5492620	I'll just have a vision of it.
5492620	5496620	Other times I'll sit down at the piano or with the guitar
5496620	5500620	and I feel music coming into my hands.
5500620	5503620	It's a very strange feeling.
5503620	5508620	But I'm sure that anybody who's out there who is an artist has experienced this.
5508620	5512620	And it doesn't seem like it's being rationalized in the moment.
5512620	5518620	How do you feel that this is different than you are prompting an AI model to put you as a picture?
5518620	5521620	I do. I feel like I'm giving it the ideas exactly.
5521620	5525620	I feel like I am the idea generator when I'm interacting with AI.
5525620	5529620	But when I'm having a human interaction, say I'm playing music with another person,
5529620	5533620	I feel like that person is generating ideas as well.
5533620	5542620	We're both making a new vision by combining our individual abilities to generate ideas to conceptualize.
5542620	5544620	Whereas I don't have that experience with AI.
5544620	5551620	I feel like I'm the one doing the ideas and the thing is just sort of doing what I tell it.
5551620	5557620	I find that my own mind is more like mid-journey than it is like Delhi when I produce ideas.
5557620	5564620	It's precisely prompting my cortex to generate the solution to some creative problem that I have.
5564620	5567620	And creativity for me involves three things.
5567620	5574620	There's first of all novelty, something that was not known to me or anybody in my direct environment before,
5574620	5577620	that is already there for me.
5577620	5580620	The second one is that it needs to be somewhat disruptive,
5580620	5585620	which means it's not the result of just following the gradient to the most obvious solution.
5585620	5592620	But there needs to be some reorganization of the space necessary, basically some jump into the darkness and landing on the other side.
5592620	5597620	You basically bridge discontinuity in the search space if it's meant to be truly creative.
5597620	5599620	This doesn't mean that the other stuff doesn't exist very often.
5599620	5605620	You just have a design problem where you are following a gradient and you come up with the best solution under the circumstances.
5605620	5607620	It's an optimization problem.
5607620	5614620	And creativity often goes beyond the simple optimization problem by having to find a new representation.
5614620	5618620	And the third one is authorship, which means it's transformative.
5618620	5624620	I get changed to the creative act in such a way that I cannot do it again while being creative,
5624620	5630620	which means to integrate the outcome of the creative process and it changes me into something that has already done that.
5630620	5632620	So I now have that representation.
5632620	5635620	I already know how it works and I can do the next step.
5635620	5639620	And arguably this last part is missing in the current breed of AI models,
5639620	5642620	but it's something that in principle could be integrated,
5642620	5647620	which means that we train the output of the model again into the model at every step.
5647620	5650620	And the model remembers that this is something that it has done.
5650620	5653620	It's also remembering all the interactions that it has to this the environment.
5653620	5657620	And in this sense, it becomes a discernible voice.
5657620	5663620	And I think this would be a prerequisite for turning an AI model into something that is able to create art.
5663620	5666620	At the moment, it's not in my perspective.
5666620	5669620	It is producing artifacts that look a lot like art,
5669620	5672620	but they don't fit my technical definition of art yet.
5672620	5676620	Dali has a wide range of styles that it's going to produce,
5676620	5679620	whereas mid-journey always has a particular aesthetic.
5679620	5681620	And that's why I say my mind is more like mid-journey,
5681620	5685620	because most of the stuff that my mind is creating, I recognize my own aesthetics.
5685620	5690620	And I'm able to go away from this and emulate other aesthetics to some degree,
5690620	5693620	but usually I recognize myself by default.
5693620	5698620	So I'm biased towards a particular kind of aesthetics in my own mind, even when I'm creative.
5698620	5703620	But do you ever think that the computational systems, the artificial intelligence,
5703620	5708620	will ever reach a point where they're able to look at the landscape in any particular domain?
5708620	5714620	Say they look at all of the data concerning, I don't know, how the atom behaves,
5714620	5718620	and they're able to actually suggest a theory, a new concept to you.
5718620	5721620	Hey, I think you humans are looking at it all wrong.
5721620	5727620	It's actually like this. This is the cause and effect explanation.
5727620	5731620	Do you think that that level of conceptualization is possible?
5731620	5733620	Because I've seen no hint of it whatsoever.
5733620	5736620	Without being asked, I think, is the important part of this.
5736620	5742620	Without you telling it, you are an AI that focuses on atomics.
5742620	5747620	And solving the specific question of gravitation or the specific question of electromagnetic.
5747620	5751620	The problem is the current generation of AI models. They are frustonian, radically frustonian.
5751620	5755620	The only thing that they do is basically to minimize the free energy.
5755620	5757620	They try to minimize the prediction error.
5757620	5762620	They make a prediction and then, during training, that's what the transformer is doing.
5762620	5768620	And then they minimize the deviation between the observed thing and what they predicted
5768620	5771620	by changing the structure of the model. They do this gradually.
5771620	5774620	And the transformer is a way to optimize this process.
5774620	5778620	In some sense, it's what almost all neural network paradigms are doing.
5778620	5781620	It does this by making statistics over.
5781620	5784620	We need to make the statistics over so the training becomes more efficient.
5784620	5787620	And it introduces a way to make this in parallel.
5787620	5792620	So you can use many GPUs in parallel to process the entirety of text on the Internet
5792620	5795620	or hundreds of millions of pictures simultaneously.
5795620	5798620	Otherwise, this boot-force training method wouldn't work.
5798620	5801620	And our own mind works in a very different way.
5801620	5804620	It is based on optimizing for coherence, I think.
5804620	5809620	And consciousness is a tool for achieving this coherence in a self-organizing substrate.
5809620	5816620	So basically, to becoming a coherent observer, you need to establish the notion of being a coherent observer.
5816620	5820620	And consciousness is related to doing this.
5820620	5825620	You notice when you are conscious that you have a percept of being a reflexive observer.
5826620	5829620	This basically means there is a control process going on
5829620	5833620	that is checking whether you are actually still a coherent observer or spacing out.
5833620	5839620	And by implementing this control process, your observation process is able to keep itself stable.
5839620	5847620	And the process of that observation process is to construct coherence in the world where it's not readily apparent.
5847620	5852620	And so we don't just try to minimize deviation from expectation when we observe the world.
5852620	5858620	Instead, first of all, we try to filter all those parts that we can interpret in some sense and ignore the rest.
5858620	5861620	And we have a fringe around this, some boundary,
5861620	5868620	where we gradually, step by step, increase the amount of stuff that we can interpret coherently.
5868620	5871620	And this is all happening in the service of agency.
5871620	5875620	We built our models for aesthetic reasons.
5875620	5884620	But ultimately, your neurons are being paid to discover structure for producing your ability to change the universe itself,
5884620	5889620	so you can survive and make the future compatible with you.
5889620	5892620	And it's something that we don't do for the present AI systems.
5892620	5897620	They are not built to maximize their own agency, and they are not even built to maximize their coherence yet.
5897620	5899620	Coherence is something that forms in the limit.
5899620	5906620	If you give them more data, they become more and more coherent until they approximate coherence to a sufficient degree
5906620	5912620	to convince people who are playing with these models that they are talking to something that is more coherent than most people are.
5912620	5914620	This is also the other issue.
5914620	5919620	We talked to a bunch of philosophers to tell you AI models don't understand what understanding means.
5919620	5925620	But you ask the philosophers, and they all agree that they don't have a shared understanding of what understanding means.
5925620	5928620	So AI models might be our only chance to get there.
5928620	5930620	Because the brain is so small.
5933620	5936620	That's an interesting thing, which is that the brain is so small,
5936620	5943620	and so if we are limited by the complexity of our brains, to go back to the lymphocyte example,
5943620	5947620	you have a lymphocyte that you put into the maze, there's a limit to how fast it can solve it,
5947620	5954620	because there's a limit to the amount of parallel processing that can go on inside of a cell rather than inside of a brain.
5954620	5959620	And so we accept that there's a difference in ability between a cell and a brain.
5959620	5967620	And so we should also assume that there is a difference, a complexity ramp between brains and a network of brains.
5967620	5975620	Because your network will be a product of the complexity of all of the parts, because that's the number of processes that you can run.
5976620	5991620	So to my mind, the complexity inside of an AI system doesn't reflect the complexity inside of a brain.
5991620	5996620	And so if we want to ramp our intelligence to the next level, we have to have the network of brains,
5996620	6000620	not a network of AIs that are less complex than brains.
6000620	6007620	Because the AI model right now, if you ask it what is understanding, and it doesn't have a good definition for it,
6007620	6013620	it doesn't have a good definition for it because in all of its training data, there isn't an explanation that it can find.
6013620	6015620	It's limited by its training data.
6015620	6022620	And it has no demonstrated ability to come up with its own definition set that is more coherent.
6022620	6023620	Yeah, that's what I'm trying to say.
6023620	6029620	Whereas if the training data set doesn't have anything that approximates that explanation,
6029620	6038620	it doesn't have the ability to do this next order modeling, which is, okay, this is how explanations are arrived at.
6038620	6048620	And I have to do this process with all of the data that is available to me in order to get to a place that doesn't exist in the data.
6048620	6052620	And it seems like people believe that it's possible to teach AI to do that.
6052620	6057620	But you'd have to mathematically conceptualize what it means to arrive at an explanation.
6057620	6063620	And that's where that weird thing of where the hell does an idea come from begin.
6063620	6069620	Because if you're sitting somewhere and all of a sudden out of nowhere, you just have an insight.
6069620	6072620	And you're like, I don't know how I got that insight.
6072620	6080620	There's not two or three things that I connect that linearly produce this emergence of something new.
6080620	6085620	You can't mathematically program that because it's random.
6085620	6089620	It's a collection of things just in the right moment.
6089620	6095620	Your own resonant internal state is at this receptive place where this sounds crazy.
6095620	6103620	It sounds crazy, but I think that we agree that biology has a lot to do with phonons, with the resonance inside of materials.
6103620	6113620	And so the resonant inside of your brain at that moment is just right to be able to catch on to the resonance of something that's outside of it and then from that to produce an idea.
6113620	6123620	But that to me seems computationally intractable to give to a machine unless you have something that is this wet squishy thing that can resonate, which is the brain in this model.
6123620	6127620	I think that's not secretory. There are many good observations that you're making.
6127620	6135620	For instance, you observe that your reflexive self is for the most part unable to observe your idea generation process.
6135620	6138620	And there are many obvious reasons for this.
6138620	6149620	It's often a feedforward network that is built in such a way that its function cannot be decomposed into a grammatical structure that you could rationally trace.
6149620	6162620	So basically building a perceptual system that is working on your mental processes would be hard if you are using a feedforward network with a high degree of parallelism and superposition in the states that are being computed.
6162620	6167620	And phonons are a very good metaphor, I think, for a lot of what's happening in the brain.
6167620	6175620	There is a book by the ART guy.
6175620	6179620	Let me check. Just blanking out.
6179620	6181620	Grosberg, Adaptive Resonance Theory.
6181620	6182620	Are we having him coming on the show next week?
6182620	6185620	Yes, he's really great.
6185620	6193620	He basically tries to describe the entirety of processes in the nervous system as resonance processes, and I think it's a very productive paradigm.
6193620	6202620	At this point, I think nobody has turned this into a computational model that produces all this, but many good ideas in this framework.
6202620	6207620	But it's still computational. There is nothing that is paradigmatically different.
6207620	6210620	It's just a particular way to look at the computations.
6210620	6219620	And I keep saying that I guess that sometimes a better metaphor for what the brain is doing is not circuitry, but it's something like an ether.
6220620	6231620	And the medium of the propagation are neurons and adjacent cell types that are taking the signal and reaching it forward to other cells while modulating it.
6231620	6238620	And all the computations are taking place in these activation fronts, and these activation fronts, for that thing to work, need to be periodic.
6238620	6245620	So there's basically cyclical waves that are passing through the neural substrate and producing behavior.
6245620	6250620	And this spreading of these activation fronts is so slow that it's roughly at the speed of sound.
6250620	6252620	So phonons is not a bad metaphor.
6252620	6267620	And very often the neurons are not deterministic, which means that given the same environmental configuration, the neuron is not going to go into a single particular state, but in one out of multiple states, because they're not completely deterministic.
6267620	6272620	And this means that if you want to guarantee getting a particular kind of result from this, you need a bunch of neurons.
6272620	6276620	So statistically of them, most of them are going to get into that state.
6276620	6282620	But what the others are going to do is that they sample a space of function that is adjacent to the result that you want.
6282620	6297620	And this gives you sometimes more power, because instead of having to train your neurons to perform one function only, you can constrain them to compute a bunch of functions simultaneously and then voting on the outcome of the results.
6297620	6312620	It's a slightly different paradigm in thinking about how this computation works in the brain compared to our digital computers, which I think is responsible for the fact that our brains are so efficient despite being so abysmally slow and unreliable.
6312620	6318620	And if you look at the graphics card, they have so much larger memory than our brains and are so much faster.
6318620	6324620	Why are they so less efficient, so little more efficient than what our brain is?
6324620	6332620	It sounds like you're saying that crossing this conceptual barrier requires a hardware shift in the pursuit of artificial intelligence.
6332620	6336620	Not necessarily. I know a bunch of people who are working on neuromorphic chips.
6336620	6350620	And my own intuition is that if your main task is or main mission in life is to figure out how the mind works, don't start with building hardware and then trying to figure out how to get software to run on them, but simulate your hardware first on a GPU.
6350620	6357620	And there is some evidence that for most of the existing neuromorphic chips, you can simulate them on a GPU.
6357620	6370620	And that's basically running software that works like this requires you to constrain yourself to something that only works in the way in which a neuromorphic chip does and not using all the capabilities of the hardware.
6370620	6378620	So basically it seems that our hardware is luring us into using classes of algorithms that are suboptimal because the hardware is so powerful.
6378620	6393620	With biology, it feels like a lot of its functionality comes down to resonance and these multiple states of resonance that layer onto each other and then produce action.
6393620	6401620	Is it possible to encode analog resonance into a digital system?
6401620	6405620	Yes, of course. The thing is that the analog resonance has a finite resolution.
6405620	6410620	The resolution is actually usually quite small until it gets drowned out in noise.
6410620	6416620	And it's similar to having an analog record on a very coarse vinyl substrate.
6417620	6424620	To build a CD-ROM that is able to exceed this resolution of the analog substrate is not hard.
6424620	6427620	It's just a design solution that you're taking.
6427620	6441620	And so in some sense, if you are willing to accept that your software needs to be slightly different on every substrate, you could build noisy analog chips that require less energy to run than deterministic digital chips.
6441620	6447620	But the price is that your software needs to be adaptive, that it needs to deal with how your hardware feels today.
6447620	6455620	Yeah, and that seems to be something that is key to biology.
6455620	6461620	It's the adaptability. It's the fact that today you don't feel like you did yesterday.
6461620	6465620	And so the product of everything that you do is different.
6465620	6468620	And I think that that's not a bug in the software.
6468620	6476620	I feel like that's actually a function for creativity and evolution and desire and will.
6476620	6483620	And I mean, I think that it starts well before the complexity of a human, where that's the case.
6483620	6491620	I once woke up after a major surgery and asked people how the surgery went while being still in the ER.
6491620	6496620	And they told me and they were visibly disturbed and asked them what was going on.
6496620	6500620	And they told me they had the exact conversation like for the third time.
6500620	6506620	And it was because part of the anesthesia that I've got inhibited long-term memory formation.
6506620	6508620	It was still active while I was in the ER.
6508620	6512620	So I would not have been able to form a long-term memory trace of the conversation that I had.
6512620	6514620	It was only playing out in working memory.
6514620	6519620	And then I fall asleep, woke up again and had the same conversation pretty much word for word.
6519620	6523620	This means that my macroscopic behavior is pretty deterministic.
6523620	6528620	And the reason why it doesn't repeat is because I form memory that stops me from repeating.
6528620	6530620	Because I don't need to do it again.
6530620	6536620	It's also the reason why older people repeat themselves because they don't form long-term memory traces of the conversation.
6538620	6539620	That's terrifying.
6539620	6541620	Yes, it is.
6541620	6547620	I don't know. I think that that actually fits really neatly into my picture of nature,
6547620	6552620	where life is a form of long-term memory formation.
6552620	6560620	The structure itself of this heritable information that is modulated over the course of your life
6560620	6569620	and then passed down to your offspring through an epigenetic mechanism is basically the whole point of life.
6569620	6573620	And it seems pretty straightforward that on a processing level,
6573620	6578620	it's relatively easy to lose that when some system goes offline.
6578620	6589620	But that just speaks to the way that our brains are a more complex version of what life is already doing on the most basic level.
6591620	6596620	I don't know how much information we can actually pass on epigenetically to offspring.
6596620	6603620	Ultimately, I think that's not a question of what's the most poetic interpretation of reality, but an empirical question.
6603620	6610620	I don't know how much racial memory I've got epigenetically for my parents.
6610620	6614620	Who knows? Maybe we'll figure it out.
6614620	6619620	But I suspect that most of the stuff is just passed on genetically, and the rest is observation.
6620620	6627620	There are probably a few bits that can be encoded during the lifetime of my parents into sperm and eggs and then expanded in the next generation.
6627620	6632620	But I suspect it's not that much because this recording mechanism will be very hard to implement.
6632620	6643620	And so I suspect that most of the transmission of information across generations happens by explicit communication between parents and children.
6644620	6652620	You might be right to some degree because there is a twin studies are an interesting insight into this
6652620	6656620	because you can take people that are twins that are raised under different conditions,
6656620	6664620	and then you find out what contribution is maintained on a genetic basis and what contribution seems to be defined by environmental considerations.
6664620	6670620	But from what I can tell, you know, actually, I don't know enough about this.
6670620	6674620	I have to read more twin studies in order to be able to evaluate how much is.
6674620	6684620	I think that is a romantic hope that we can break out of the genetic determinism by some magical epigenetic mechanism, but I suspect it's not going to work.
6684620	6703620	I want to go back to what you were talking about with the hardware advancements that are necessary to produce anything approximating artificial general intelligence.
6703620	6711620	And it occurred to me that in a digital system, you might have a very high level of resolution.
6711620	6719620	You mentioned the CD versus the vinyl, but when it comes to actually recording the information in the first place,
6719620	6732620	people who work in audio recording prize analog equipment because well, not because it is high fidelity, but because of the harmonic distortion that it introduces.
6732620	6748620	And I wonder how much of our conscious experiences are predicated on that harmonic distortion in a constructive sense that it adds a level of richness to our experience that wouldn't be possible in a digital system.
6748620	6755620	I suspect that a lot of the limitations of digital equipment are due to cost reduction.
6755620	6766620	Basically, in order to make this thing work, it's not going to exploit the limit of what's technologically possible, but it makes measurements on a number of subjects in an app under controlled conditions.
6766620	6776620	And when the subjects are no longer perceiving any kind of difference to the analog signal that you're done, you don't need to be much better.
6776620	6779620	Maybe you put in some safety margin and then you're good.
6779620	6785620	And then you can basically scientifically prove that you now have a recording that has higher quality than vinyl.
6785620	6789620	But this thing is working based on some assumption.
6789620	6798620	For instance, when you look at an RGB screen, the pigments of the RGB screen are producing signals that are tuned to your receptors.
6798620	6801620	But there are interpersonal differences between the receptors.
6801620	6804620	Some people are sensitive to slightly different wavelengths.
6804620	6813620	So if you only use three types of emitters for light to simulate the entire spectrum, you're not going to get the same result for everybody.
6813620	6815620	And a similar thing is happening with audio.
6815620	6819620	Basically, there are people which are way more sensitive in some frequency areas than others.
6819620	6827620	And if you have an analog medium, your brain has to piece out from this analog distortion what the result is.
6827620	6829620	And there are no gaps in this analog signal.
6829620	6832620	There's basically this smooth property of the signal.
6832620	6837620	And that is something that I couldn't appreciate so much when I was younger.
6837620	6851620	And now I notice that when I look at heavily processed digital film material that I often feel that I see differences in the grain where some filter has been applied and then the filter stops being applied.
6851620	6852620	And this annoys me.
6852620	6860620	I look at the Villeneuve dune and I look at the CGI and it's very unsatisfying to me because I feel that the foreground and the background doesn't match.
6860620	6862620	There's something completely wrong.
6862620	6863620	I cannot put my finger onto it.
6863620	6875620	And so when I look at the much more primitive tricks in a Kobozara movie that are entirely analog, I find it's much more digestible because I don't see this cutoff.
6875620	6880620	It feels to me that there is some kind of smooth continuum into it.
6880620	6887620	But I'm still not willing to romanticize this into thinking that analog is in principle superior to digital.
6887620	6896620	But it could be that if you want to get something that is completely equivalent, we need to do a much higher resolution on the digital substrate.
6896620	6904620	I mean, there's been an incredible advancement in the last 10 years in the audio recording realm, which is where I'm most comfortable,
6904620	6911620	which is that you create plugins, you create modules which are capable of introducing that harmonic distortion.
6911620	6920620	But you have to know that you want it in the first place and you have to know that you're modeling something in the analog world and that that distortion turns out to be really important.
6920620	6932620	When people first started getting all of this high tech digital equipment in the 90s, they were immediately struck by how cold and despite all of its high fidelity, it sounded awful.
6932620	6939620	And they had to really go back and analyze what it was in those particular distortions that they wanted to keep.
6939620	6951620	And there's really a high art to introducing those distortions in a way that keeps the music pleasant to the ear while actually ruining the high fidelity of the signal.
6951620	6954620	It's an interesting paradox.
6954620	6967620	I noticed the weird thing that when I look at audio recordings from classical music, there are a lot of recordings I cannot relate to and a few that work much, much better.
6967620	6979620	And I talked to some of the pianists and I had the impression that there is some correlation between the pianist being synesthete and this music working on me.
6979620	6986620	And they describe a similar thing that sometimes they have the wrong piano and they're not able to experience synesthesia while playing it.
6986620	6988620	That's what doesn't work for them.
6988620	6999620	And this synesthesia relates to your brain going into resonance at some level using obviously has to do with overtones in the music that you may not consciously perceive when you listen to it.
6999620	7006620	But it has something to do with because you're not reflecting on it is how your perceptual system is processing the data.
7006620	7015620	And the gap between how perception works and how your mental conductor is listening to what the instruments of your mind are producing is responsible for some difference.
7015620	7021620	So you might not be consciously noticing difference between stimuli, but your brain might be.
7021620	7037620	And so this thing that you noticed that the music that at some level is indistinguishable to the listener is producing a different mood and listeners might have to do with their subconscious processing going on that leads to a different outcome.
7037620	7045620	And will that level of processing ever be available in the digital realm to artificial intelligence?
7045620	7050620	I don't see why not. I suspect that AI is already processing at much higher resolution.
7050620	7055620	The problem is that the model often doesn't know what the ground truth is that it would resolve to.
7055620	7061620	So I suspect that we could in principle build AI systems right now that are able to read thoughts of people.
7061620	7067620	But setting up the training with the present stack of algorithms is very hard.
7068620	7082620	Well, I would think that one of the barriers to being able to create that kind of digital emulation of a mind is understanding what kind of overtones and resonance needs to be brought into it.
7082620	7098620	Because when Sheila is talking about plugins that emulate analog equipment, what they've done to create those plugins is that they've gone and they've looked at the resonant properties, the harmonic properties of the original analog equipment,
7098620	7108620	characterized how they emerge from various sounds, and then apply that function to the sound that's inside of the computer.
7108620	7121620	So if you don't have that characterization of the resonance in the first place, you can't possibly program it into the computer because it is a resonance that is necessary to know.
7121620	7127620	Yeah, it just seems like these things are always one step behind us. No matter what happens, they can't get out in front of...
7127620	7142620	Yeah, it's much more complicated than this. For instance, I bought the AirPods Pro because Apple removed their headphone plug from the iPhone and I could no longer use my pretty decent analog headphones.
7142620	7149620	And I hated them because they sounded worse than $20 wired Panasonic earplugs.
7149620	7155620	And it was just very uninspiring sound. It was not that there's obviously something wrong with it, but there was really nothing I liked about it.
7155620	7166620	And then they died after a couple of years due to an Apple manufacturing defect that they started to crack a lot of half that it was out of warranty for a month.
7166620	7176620	So I could not get a replacement from Apple and had to buy the AirPods 2, AirPods Pro 2, these ones. And they're amazing. They're magical.
7176620	7186620	They're not audiophile. They don't sound super realistic, but they're like a brain implant.
7186620	7193620	They're able to make my brain resonate with certain frequencies in a way that I could not get with other audio devices.
7193620	7202620	So for particular types of music sounds, especially electronic, they work much better than other types of headphones for me.
7202620	7211620	It really depends on the kind of interaction that you want to have. A lot of the analog equipment that sounds very warm is not necessarily sounding realistic.
7211620	7216620	It is producing a particular kind of experience that you want to have.
7216620	7220620	Because it's tickling your nervous system in a particular way.
7220620	7228620	And there is a lot of stuff that can only be done electronically that is difficult to achieve with analog equipment.
7228620	7232620	You just don't need all that resolution, right? I don't need to hear.
7232620	7239620	There's very few singers that you really want to hear every aspect of their mouth moving and so forth.
7239620	7245620	Sometimes you do. So there is stuff that I can hear with this that is difficult to hear on very high fidelity equipment.
7245620	7251620	Because it is artificially, at least that's what it sounds like to me, expanding some of the range.
7251620	7256620	And so you're able to hear stuff that is much harder to hear in unprocessed sound.
7256620	7261620	And the processing for some types of music really produces a good effect.
7261620	7270620	And when you are sitting in an airplane, there's a lot of environmental noise and an environment that is mostly an animal rights violation.
7270620	7276620	And you have this thing that is overriding some of that. It doesn't need to be extremely high fidelity.
7276620	7283620	It just needs to capture your nervous system and produce the right kind of resonance that you're interested in.
7283620	7287620	This reminds me of... What was that? Was it R-Bass?
7287620	7292620	The program that would produce bass frequencies that could...
7292620	7298620	There's some kind of program that people use for small speakers that can't actually produce bass waves.
7298620	7303620	Oh yeah, R-Bass, the plugin. Sorry, yeah. It's a waves plugin for audio engineering.
7303620	7304620	Shout out to waves.
7304620	7313620	But it's basically a way of taking the harmonics that would be produced by the low frequency wave that your speakers can't actually produce
7313620	7316620	and propagating them into the higher range of frequencies.
7316620	7327620	And so creating this kind of phantom bass note that you hear the actual bass note by extrapolating where it belongs.
7328620	7331620	Saxophones work like this too, for a more analog version.
7331620	7335620	But you're actually hearing the overtones and your mind extrapolates the fundamental from it.
7335620	7337620	That's fascinating.
7337620	7346620	And so it seems like that's what this is doing, which is that the headphones probably understand the kinds of frequencies that are necessary for richness
7346620	7351620	because they've studied it enough, they've characterized what creates a rich resonant sound
7351620	7362620	and then they're able to tweak the waveform of the song in order to get it to be more in tune with the way that you want to hear it.
7362620	7370620	And so what they're doing is they're tuning your brain in relation to the tech that's producing the sound.
7370620	7384620	And that kind of gets me onto the next set of topics, which is how technology that we are developing seems escapist to some degree.
7384620	7393620	And it seems like instead of addressing that the way that airplanes operate is an animal rights violation,
7393620	7402620	we produce the technology that allows us to tune out of it and to just accept the world as it is and to just shuffle along until we can get into a different environment.
7402620	7405620	Most of nature is an animal rights violation.
7405620	7413620	Most of the stuff that happens outside of a factory farm is worse than the stuff that happens inside of the factory farm to most conscious beings on the planet.
7413620	7416620	I elaborate on that because I don't know that I agree.
7416620	7425620	I think this idea of living free in nature is easy to romanticize, but evolution is very unpleasant for most of its participants.
7425620	7433620	And I think that life on Earth itself is something that is full of pain and it's undesirable.
7433620	7437620	And we have opted out of this for good reasons.
7437620	7443620	It's creating a highly artificial and often alienating environment.
7443620	7453620	There is an evidence that people feel more fulfilled when you get rid of all the creature comforts and you have to fight for your naked survival because you don't have time for depression.
7453620	7461620	And so a lot of the alienation that we experience is the result of, in some sense, being too comfortable for us.
7461620	7465620	And that we need to escape from this is also something that increases discomfort.
7465620	7469620	But there is no easy solution, no easy way out of it.
7469620	7473620	It's a peculiarity that we find ourselves in.
7473620	7477620	And it's also something that enables the kind of conversation that we have right now.
7477620	7485620	This thing that you are sitting in your remote studio and we're having a Zoom conversation while I'm sitting down here in Mendo Park.
7485620	7490620	We're talking into our microphones and listening to each other through the headphones.
7490620	7495620	You could say there is something escapist to people listening to the effects of that.
7495620	7497620	But there's also something valuable to it.
7497620	7500620	We produce a cultural artifact that otherwise wouldn't exist.
7500620	7504620	There is the wild guess train to meet itself in our conversation.
7504620	7508620	And don't be too judgmental about that.
7508620	7511620	I'm just curious if you can sell me on this factory farm thing.
7511620	7519620	Because when I think about the fundamental difference, it's that the animal is able to express its agency in the wild.
7519620	7522620	And it has one bad day where maybe it's shot in the head by a hunter.
7522620	7528620	But the animal in the factory farm comes to understand that its freedom is restricted.
7528620	7533620	And it suffers its inability to actualize itself on a day-to-day basis.
7533620	7537620	And that's what is fundamentally disturbing to me about factory farms.
7540620	7549620	There is a Chinese author, Liu Qixin, I probably mispronounced him, who is most famous for The Dark Forest.
7549620	7559620	And he wrote a short story, and I hope I don't misattributed him, but I think it was him, where he describes how a few aliens arrive on Earth.
7559620	7566620	And they say that they are the last survivors of a planet that has been destroyed by a planet eater.
7566620	7569620	The planet eater is something like a spaceship.
7569620	7571620	It's larger than the planet.
7571620	7578620	And it is a traveling civilization that basically goes from planet to planet and harvests its biosphere.
7579620	7584620	And it's so strong that it's basically impossible to defend yourself against it.
7584620	7590620	But humanity has a head start because they meet this fugitive who gives them an advance warning.
7590620	7593620	And they build a major fleet and planetary defenses.
7593620	7599620	And when the planet eater spaceship arrives, they manage to make a minor dent in it before they are harvested.
7600620	7605620	And this gives the planet eater civilization a lot of respect for people.
7605620	7610620	And they try to sample them and realize that humans are actually quite decent food species.
7610620	7621620	So they get promoted, which means that part of the human civilization is allowed to go on board of this planet eater civilization and permanently live as a food species there,
7621620	7623620	which means they will be treated exceptionally well.
7623620	7630620	It's a very advanced technological civilization, a very good life, at the end of which they will be painlessly killed and eaten.
7631620	7636620	And there is this big conflict between the heroes of the story,
7636620	7642620	the ones who are building the army to defend Earth and their children, who decide to go on this ship.
7642620	7650620	And the children think that their parents are insane to resist because life is objectively so much better as a food species than it was before on Earth.
7650620	7656620	Everybody is so much more fulfilled and so much more happy and has so less stress out
7656620	7660620	because the aliens are just organizing the best possible experience of life that you could have.
7660620	7668620	Factory farms don't organize a good experience, right? By definition, that's the problem.
7668620	7670620	But it's just the imperfection that they have, right?
7670620	7673620	You could have a factory farm that is producing a better experience.
7673620	7677620	And it also makes sense for the factory farm to do this, for some reason, right?
7677620	7684620	Because animals that grow up without distress and unnecessary suffering probably grow up more efficiently.
7684620	7689620	Suffering is just friction. It's something that is suboptimal.
7689620	7692620	And I believe that in some sense Garden Eden is about this, right?
7692620	7696620	The Garden of Eden is this place with lush agricultural production and no screaming,
7696620	7700620	which implies it's a factory farm in which everything is fully domesticated.
7700620	7703620	Everything is fully submitting to the will of the Creator.
7703620	7708620	And that thing that defines us as humans, this food of knowledge, the freedom to defect,
7708620	7713620	the freedom to play short games, the freedom to not submit to the divine will
7713620	7721620	before we are able to recognize ourselves, is a deviation from this ideal that has been created there.
7721620	7727620	And in some sense, our mission as a species is the attempt to create something that's better than Eden,
7727620	7729620	better than the factory farm.
7729620	7733620	And the big hope is that heaven and Eden are not the same thing in the end.
7733620	7739620	That we do not just re-lobotomize ourselves to be domesticated again.
7739620	7748620	I mean, I think that it's easy for me to reparse your sentence to say more that factory farm could be better than nature.
7748620	7755620	And I think there's truth to that because I always think about our cat.
7755620	7765620	She definitely prefers the domesticated life to the alternative because she gets her dry food, she gets her wet food.
7765620	7773620	She literally spends hours a day just lying around totally comfortable with no concern for anything in the world.
7773620	7775620	She bosses us around.
7775620	7781620	It's very, very good for her in that context, better than it would be for a wild cat.
7781620	7784620	We like to say she's the happiest animal in the world.
7784620	7786620	She just sits around for hours a day purring.
7786620	7788620	It's just unbelievable, actually.
7788620	7790620	I wish I could switch places with her several times a day.
7790620	7796620	We also think that next lifetime we want to spend one lifetime rest and recreation as our cat.
7796620	7797620	Exactly.
7797620	7813620	And so I acknowledge that there is a push towards domestication because people have this tendency of looking at modernity and thinking that people in the past made a mistake.
7813620	7822620	They made some kind of bargain that they shouldn't have made and if they were better informed about the future consequences that they wouldn't have made it.
7822620	7826620	But then you go back and you look at the way that people used to live and the conditions in which they lived.
7826620	7832620	It was always either too cold or too hot or there was not enough food or there was a worrying tribe.
7832620	7842620	And so we've progressively given more and more control to structures that we value that relieve us of these terrible pressures of nature.
7842620	7849620	Like Shiloh and I will go into the woods and there's this river that we go to and it's a beautiful river, absolutely pristine.
7849620	7854620	But I look around at the landscape and it's a hard landscape to survive in.
7854620	7856620	You know, there's not a lot of food on it.
7856620	7858620	It's very exposed.
7858620	7859620	There's not a lot of shade.
7859620	7864620	Massive wildfires have come through it over the course of the last 20 years.
7864620	7868620	And so it's just this really strained place.
7868620	7883620	And I grant you that that really strained condition makes it makes an imperative that wants us to leave nature and to create a contained garden in which things are going to be OK.
7883620	7901620	But then you also end up at the fact that that creation of the garden produces psychological distress that manifests as anxiety and neurosis, alienation, depression.
7901620	7904620	And my parents are Soviet immigrants.
7904620	7916620	They left the Soviet Union and made this incredible step from how awful it was inside the Soviet Union to the West.
7916620	7925620	And my dad always tells the story of how when they were leaving, everyone told them that they were going to die, that they were they were abandoning the Soviet Union.
7925620	7930620	And it was the biggest mistake that they were ever going to make because the West would destroy them.
7930620	7941620	And then he went to the grocery store in Israel and would just spend hours browsing through the shelves in awe of the variety.
7941620	7945620	You know, there's like 15 different types of yogurts.
7945620	7949620	Everything is packaged for being tasty and consumable.
7949620	7962620	And he really valued that transition from something unpleasant to something really varied and that embodied perhaps you can say the illusion of choice,
7962620	7967620	but at least gave him this feeling of my God, there's so many things that I can choose from.
7967620	7973620	And that now that he's settled and he's a tech worker and it's been 20 years at the same company,
7973620	7989620	I can tell that he has this nostalgic feeling of not having that stepwise increase in quality of life available to him anymore because he's reached arguably the top of the world.
7989620	7991620	He can't get any farther.
7991620	8000620	And so he's looking around, he's like, everything is good, but it just doesn't have the same quality that it did when I went from bad to good.
8000620	8007620	And I think that that's what domestication would lead to unless you start really messing with people's neurotransmitters.
8007620	8012620	You're going to end up with people that are domesticated and unhappy.
8012620	8017620	That seems to be inherent in our desires to be constantly improving.
8017620	8020620	And if you get to paradise, what do you have?
8020620	8026620	If I go back to Europe, it feels usually more real to me than the US does.
8026620	8031620	And I think that's in part because it has more layers.
8031620	8040620	In some sense, many of these layers are obsolete and outdated because the modern capitalist late stage society that is imposed on it,
8040620	8048620	that no longer relies on the social regulation that evolved over many centuries and that is mostly absent in the US.
8048620	8057620	So in some sense, the US is more adapted to constant innovation and constantly reinventing itself than Europe is.
8057620	8068620	But the prices that you also have the impression that there is far less steps into everything that seems to be far less substance to most of the interactions that you perceive.
8068620	8075620	They're more transparent usually and more transactional fields than they have been in Europe.
8075620	8086620	And I could imagine that this is an aspect of the dissatisfaction that your dad might be experiencing at his current famous employer in the tech industry.
8086620	8092620	How interesting are the people that you're interacting with? How meaningful is the stuff that is happening?
8092620	8099620	When I grew up in Eastern Germany, the core of our experience was books and ideas and theater.
8099620	8102620	Every intellectual was, by definition, a dissident.
8102620	8109620	It made for an interesting interaction with other people and to be in a world where most intellectuals are not dissidents,
8109620	8115620	but influencers that serve an audience and in between sell products.
8115620	8122620	So the YouTube channel flies or do the equivalent that maybe they sell books or something like that.
8122620	8125620	It's a very different life to be in.
8126620	8133620	So if you are self-identifying or maybe not identifying but functionally are bohemian in the way in which you probably are,
8133620	8141620	it's much harder to survive in a capitalist society where the actual nature of survival is so blatantly obvious.
8141620	8147620	That's interesting. I'm not sure that my dad is particularly bohemian.
8147620	8150620	No, but you are.
8150620	8159620	We've tried to sidestep this. So far, it's really shocked me, but we're entirely supported by our audience directly.
8159620	8167620	We have a huge patron base. Like I was saying before, we have kind of an incredible ratio of patrons to audience.
8167620	8172620	We don't have advertisements. We don't have any sponsors. We don't have any institutional affiliations.
8172620	8173620	Well, we run ads at the beginning.
8173620	8179620	We don't do them, but YouTube will run ads whether or not we monetize them essentially at the beginning of episodes.
8179620	8188620	But in general, I think there is a way out of that if you are able to provide a service directly to the people that are your audience at the end of the day.
8188620	8189620	Yeah, I agree.
8189620	8192620	I hope it continues to work.
8192620	8194620	But I think that it's a choice that you have to make.
8194620	8203620	And I think that it is true that the American tendency is to optimize for making money because you see people who have podcasts or they have venues
8203620	8209620	and there's just ads splattered over them as a function of the product.
8209620	8216620	And it's obvious that the intellectual material is simply a vessel for the ads.
8216620	8219620	That's the feeling you get when you read CNN or something.
8219620	8221620	Yeah, there's text and yeah, there's some new stuff.
8221620	8232620	But what it is is it's a glorified ad board because that's the business model is that they have to sell you something that you'll read so that your eyes will fall upon the advertising.
8232620	8236620	Even Google itself has turned into an ad board.
8236620	8237620	Yeah, it's incredible.
8237620	8244620	The quality of Google search results has just plummeted over the course of the years because the ad board functionality has increased incredibly.
8244620	8250620	I think it's possible to get out of that.
8250620	8254620	I think that you have to make something that people really want.
8255620	8263620	But this is a little bit parallel to what I was saying earlier about the goal and the desire where I think that in Europe,
8263620	8270620	there is an older culture that has been molded by war.
8270620	8279620	It has been molded by terrible events, things that are really horrific fractures in history that the people have had to deal with
8279620	8285620	and reconcile themselves against and learn lessons from in a way that travels from generation to generation.
8285620	8290620	It also has been molded by the church and by the kings and so by feudalism.
8290620	8296620	There has been a structure that has been constructed, that has evolved into some kind of an organism.
8296620	8303620	And societies have been built into such organisms that had to survive in the competition with each other.
8303620	8306620	And the U.S. is a very different country in this regard.
8306620	8311620	There were never kings in the U.S. There was never a state church in the U.S.
8311620	8317620	It was a bunch of freemasons who built their colony into some kind of new project
8317620	8323620	and then had a society that basically was constructed out of clubs that were interacting with each other.
8323620	8329620	And at the core of the society is not the king, but the entrepreneur, the one who starts the club.
8329620	8335620	That's a really, really apt observation because we've many times on the show encountered the idea
8335620	8343620	that America is fundamentally built as a corporation. It's a group of corporations.
8343620	8347620	You could say it's voluntary associations. The churches in the U.S. are also important.
8347620	8350620	The schools are important. The legal system is important.
8350620	8356620	Many of these things are not corporations. A corporation is just one type of club.
8356620	8360620	It's a club that is designed to have and be economically sustainable
8360620	8366620	and is using a particular part of the legal system to negotiate the rules for that happening.
8366620	8372620	How does somebody enter it? How do you take financial care of the people who work for your association full time,
8372620	8376620	even after they are leaving it? How do you deal with their medical issues?
8376620	8380620	All these things are discussed in this corporate law that has evolved.
8381620	8388620	You can even have shared ownership. The public can own shares of your associations.
8388620	8391620	It's a very sophisticated kind of organization.
8391620	8400620	From some perspective, if you basically drop this lens of our default leftist interpretation of society
8400620	8403620	and realize you can be anyone in the society because nobody is stopping us,
8403620	8408620	you can decide whether you want to work for someone or have other people working for you.
8408620	8413620	It's completely novel. That didn't exist in other types of society before, historically.
8413620	8421620	Basically, we dropped this lens of an interpretation that has evolved at Marx times, for instance,
8421620	8424620	and we come into the world with completely fresh eyes.
8424620	8430620	It's so fascinating that there was never a society where people lived so well as this one.
8430620	8436620	Everything that's wrong with the U.S. takes this into comparison to how many societies
8436620	8439620	with 400 million people are better organized than the U.S.
8439620	8443620	It's difficult to get the feedback loops right in the large system.
8443620	8447620	It's much easier to organize Liechtenstein or Switzerland.
8447620	8454620	But for a thing that is so large and is not historically grown but has constructed itself, it's pretty good.
8454620	8459620	It's a fascinating project that exists and I'm quite fascinated.
8459620	8465620	It's not that I idealize it. It's also in a similar way I'm not idealizing the factory farm by no means.
8465620	8470620	I find it abhorrent. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want to have any part of this.
8470620	8474620	The only thing that I want to point at is that there are so many types of perspectives,
8474620	8479620	so many types of possible minds, so many possible mental states that we could be in ourselves
8479620	8485620	where we can transcend our momentary identity and try to take in the possible space of people
8485620	8490620	that we could also be or of possible minds that we could also be when we interact with reality.
8491620	8497620	That we basically accept the accidentality of how we are subjectively experiencing anything.
8497620	8504620	I find it really hopeful that we have been progressing towards more voluntary associations
8504620	8507620	as our own country's history has unfolded.
8507620	8511620	We've been studying the civil rights movement a lot lately through film.
8511620	8517620	And it strikes me that even in the last few years, the majority of our national conflicts
8517620	8524620	have centered around the justness of laws which are not voluntary associations,
8524620	8529620	which are imposed from without, from beyond.
8529620	8533620	That's also incidentally part of the core of the constitution of the US.
8533620	8539620	The freedom to associate. And the US is at its core a very liberal society.
8539620	8543620	And liberty is the concept of freedom from unjustified authority.
8544620	8548620	It's really at the core of this. And right now there are big debates about liberty.
8548620	8551620	For instance, with respect to topics like vaccination.
8551620	8554620	How does this interfere with the liberty of the individual?
8554620	8560620	How does the FDA interfere with the liberty of the individual to buy cough medicine?
8560620	8562620	It's quite complicated.
8562620	8568620	And it's a very complex process of negotiation and litigation that is taking place there.
8569620	8574620	Well, beyond just the complicated process of litigation and negotiation,
8574620	8580620	there's also the question of belief in the legitimacy of the system.
8580620	8587620	Where the comment that I was trying to make about corporatism is that in the United States,
8587620	8590620	and perhaps this is also the case in Europe, I don't know enough about it,
8590620	8596620	but the government seems like it has been largely co-opted by the interests of corporations.
8596620	8605620	And the process by which that has happened is legal and social and structural.
8605620	8607620	But the end result is the same.
8607620	8615620	That the interests of the people are not necessarily what is first and foremost the question of debate.
8615620	8619620	It seems that the interest of corporate profits is first.
8619620	8621620	Because we've all bought into the system.
8621620	8626620	Anybody that has a 401k or owns an index fund is immediately complicit
8626620	8629620	in this well-being of the massive corporations.
8629620	8634620	And so we are all part of this process by which we agree that,
8634620	8641620	okay, we need the corporate system to work because that is the platform on which we build our well-being.
8641620	8647620	And yet at the same time, we recognize that there's a direct conflict
8647620	8653620	between the process of the extractive corporation and the well-being of existence.
8653620	8655620	An alignment issue, I would say.
8655620	8658620	I would totally agree. We've been talking about this a whole lot,
8658620	8663620	about the question of AI alignment as not being a new question.
8663620	8665620	We can't align our corporations.
8665620	8669620	Those are already AIs that are simpler than the one that we're building.
8669620	8673620	And so we should be able to align them. It should be relatively straight.
8674620	8676620	It's so simple. I thought the same.
8676620	8678620	I made the same argument as you did in the past.
8678620	8683620	And at some point, I was surprised empirically, why is not every corporation like Enron?
8683620	8686620	Why is Enron the exception, not the rule, or Halliburton?
8686620	8690620	Why are most corporations more like Amazon?
8690620	8694620	And that, for me, is a completely fascinating phenomenon.
8694620	8701620	I suspect without Amazon, we would have had difficulty to get to the pandemic relatively unscathed, as we did.
8701620	8704620	I don't think that we would have had a pandemic without Amazon.
8704620	8707620	You think Amazon is responsible for the pandemic?
8707620	8714620	No, no, no. I think that if the same virus had appeared 15, 20 years ago,
8714620	8717620	I don't think that we would have had a worldwide lockdown.
8717620	8723620	I think that our technological ability created the possibility for our reaction.
8723620	8727620	The fact that you could live in your house and you could order everything remotely
8727620	8729620	and have your essential workers bring it to you.
8729620	8736620	The fact that there was basically a small subset of the population that was credited as being essential
8736620	8739620	but are generally the lowest tier of our society,
8739620	8742620	and everybody else could go home and work on their computers,
8742620	8749620	was exclusively the product of our technological advancement that made it so that it was possible.
8749620	8754620	Because before Zoom, before remote work, you couldn't have stopped everybody from going into the office.
8754620	8757620	The entire world would have collapsed overnight.
8757620	8764620	I suspect that if the pandemic would have happened 60, 70 years ago, we would have had efficient lockdowns.
8764620	8770620	People would have said, of course, we will not have a single plane coming in from China as of right now.
8770620	8775620	And it would not have been anybody saying, oh, but this is racist. You cannot do that.
8775620	8778620	There would not have been lots of voices that tried to negotiate about this,
8778620	8783620	because government back then wasn't a performance. It was still modernist.
8783620	8787620	And right now, we don't have this cohesion in the negotiation anymore.
8787620	8790620	And in part, it's because we have increased the degrees of liberty.
8790620	8795620	But in part, it's also because we're too big to fail now.
8795620	8801620	And as a result, we do not feel the need to have tight administration anymore.
8801620	8806620	We no longer feel that we can afford to build a society where we enforce rule following.
8806620	8812620	You have to deal with a society where 20% of the population are not going to observe your lockdowns.
8812620	8820620	And at the same time, you will not be able to mobilize the army against them because that would seem to be excessive.
8820620	8825620	And so I suspect that in a different time, we probably wouldn't have had the pandemic
8825620	8829620	because we would have been able to prevent getting infected.
8829620	8835620	There's also this other thing that at a different time, we would not have been able to create the virus because we didn't have the technology.
8835620	8837620	That's probably true, too.
8837620	8852620	But I think that there is a certain structural shift to the way that we react to things that is informed by the technological ability that we have in the background.
8852620	8863620	And so if you have something that is a virus that is coming from China and you stop all travel from China after you find out about the virus, it's probably too late.
8863620	8873620	The earliest known cases at this point were in maybe March of 2019.
8873620	8876620	And so it started much earlier than we realized.
8876620	8885620	And so by the time that you get to the point where you're like, hey, the virus is in existence and the virus is in China,
8885620	8890620	it's already in the rest of the world because it's been happening for longer than you've realized.
8890620	8896620	And so even if you stop flights from China, you don't necessarily prevent the likelihood of transmission
8896620	8902620	because the lag between realizing that something is happening and it happening is pretty significant.
8902620	8908620	And so as we continue to develop progressively more and more complex technologies,
8908620	8921620	I feel like it forces us into a position where there are more universal measures that are taken that are enabled by that technology.
8921620	8929620	Like imagine terrible wildfires to the degree that it is impossible to go outside.
8929620	8934620	And fighting those wildfires is too expensive and too difficult.
8934620	8941620	And it is necessary to allow the woods to burn because we recognize that we've been stopping forest fires.
8941620	8945620	I don't need to imagine this. I've been living in California for a few years now.
8945620	8952620	I'm used to having a bunch of air filters in every room and not being able to go outside for a week in the summer.
8952620	8958620	Exactly. And so what if that just becomes the baseline level?
8958620	8971620	Like our technology allows us to live in pods and instead of dealing with the environment and managing it the way that is responsible and effective,
8971620	8981620	we just turn away from that and allow our technology to encapsulate us into this world that is dissociated from the planet.
8981620	8984620	I don't think we had much of a choice about this.
8984620	8992620	It was not like nobody knew. We have a shift in the climates right now due to the temperature changes,
8992620	8996620	which means that a lot of forests are going to turn into desert.
8996620	9001620	And so basically you don't have dry forests and tropical zones.
9001620	9005620	There's rainforests only in tropical zones because the dry forests burn down.
9005620	9013620	And so many of the forests in California that are not rainforests are going to turn into stuff that looks more like Arizona or Mexico.
9013620	9019620	It is just the way it works. And during this transition, you will need to stay indoors and use air filters.
9019620	9025620	And maybe it would have been possible to prevent it, but not just the kind of social organization that we had.
9025620	9037620	And I guess the fear that I have is that Apple's new headset is the step in the direction that allows people to completely dissociate from the world
9037620	9049620	and allows things to continue along their uncontrolled path because there's a technology that's sufficiently advanced that makes it bearable
9049620	9054620	and allows people to continue being productive members of the capitalist class.
9054620	9058620	And there's incentive structures at play here, too.
9058620	9066620	And I think that played into the pandemic as well, because if you look at the people that benefited from the lockdowns versus the people that suffered under them,
9066620	9075620	it was the big players, the big monied corporations largely that benefited from these, the biotech industry, the pharmaceutical industry,
9075620	9083620	the big box stores that were allowed to remain open while the underbrush of the forests burned down completely.
9083620	9094620	And so there's this real mismatch between the overarching structures, these corporate entities that are misaligned in this sense with the common people.
9094620	9098620	And that's a really dangerous situation as I see it socially.
9098620	9114620	And I have a feeling that when people are really freaked about AI alignment, what they're really freaked out about is the way that the technology is going to be used against the interests of the people who live subject to it.
9114620	9127620	Are you able to disengage from your activism for a moment when you do philosophy, or is this something that is your duty to observe?
9127620	9138620	And I'm not unsympathetic to the activist position that you're taking, but I suspect when you put on the alien puppets, you're more free, right?
9138620	9147620	You can look at the stuff that the chimps are doing on Earth without judging, without being opinionated, because it's just nature playing out.
9147620	9152620	There's a species that evolved to burn the oil. It's what they do. We're really good at it.
9152620	9161620	And it's probably to the benefit of Gaia. And in the process of doing this, they teach the rocks how to think.
9161620	9168620	They have no sand that is almost gotten far enough to sink, and it might create some kind of hyper Gaia.
9168620	9174620	And of course, some of the chimps are freaking out about this, and others are super optimistic about it.
9174620	9186620	And both of them might be wrong in important ways if they try to judge this thing with respect to their current preferences, because it's very hard to make models of the future from the perspective of these chimps with the limited information that they've got.
9187620	9190620	Interval that is changing in many, many dimensions simultaneously.
9190620	9197620	For me, it's very hard to commit to a single narrative. When I grew up, two thirds of my world happened inside of books.
9197620	9203620	The world outside was very beautiful. I grew up in nature and art, but it was not sufficient to keep me interested.
9203620	9208620	I needed more. I needed intellectual stimulation and interaction that I could only find in books.
9208620	9212620	Now, two thirds of my reality is inside of connected computers.
9212620	9217620	The reality that has been created inside of connected computers is what kept me alive.
9217620	9220620	I would have probably killed myself if it wouldn't have existed.
9220620	9227620	So it's very hard for me to judge it on a global scale and say this is unnatural and alienating and bad.
9227620	9232620	It's also hard for me to embrace it and say this is good and natural and beautiful.
9232620	9240620	It's fascinating that we live in this point in history at this particular configuration of the universe and get to observe it.
9240620	9246620	And we can also make judgments about it with respect to many, many lenses that we can use.
9246620	9249620	I just think it's so limiting if we only use a single one.
9249620	9256620	And there's a possibility with the Vision Pro that it's going to create a world that I hate and an aesthetic that I hate.
9256620	9258620	And I will probably not use it.
9258620	9262620	There's also a possibility that it creates something completely new that I find fascinating.
9262620	9266620	And I spent a lot of time with friends and having new experiences that I cherish.
9266620	9271620	I don't know yet. I'm open to it. I'm interested in what's going to happen.
9271620	9273620	Did you watch that?
9273620	9276620	I believe in our own agency.
9276620	9277620	Yes.
9277620	9281620	Let's maximize our own agency. Let's be able to make a choice.
9281620	9289620	Maximize our ability to choose what kind of environment we are in and create our own environments to the largest degree possible.
9289620	9296620	When we have the choice of being consumers or creators, I always prefer the situation where we can be creators,
9296620	9301620	where we can get together with others and build the world that we are in, where we can design our own spaces.
9301620	9307620	Did you happen to catch that Netflix documentary, Chimp Empire, by any chance?
9307620	9308620	No.
9308620	9317620	That's so fascinating. It's basically just following around these chimps in the jungle and watching their dramas play out.
9317620	9322620	But I remember that I listened to an interview with the documentarian,
9322620	9328620	and he was very adamant about not interfering with the lives of the chimps as they were observing them.
9328620	9333620	And I really do struggle with that when I'm out in the woods by myself.
9333620	9341620	If I see some animal or even a bug that's in trouble, I have this desire to move it out of harm's way.
9341620	9349620	And I don't regret that is the thing. I'm not sure that there's any virtue in leaving it to its own devices.
9349620	9353620	You're part of nature too. It's okay that you make these choices.
9353620	9360620	Right. Exactly. I think there's grave danger in thinking what humans do is somehow outside of nature.
9360620	9367620	And you often see that schism in the artificial or synthetic versus natural worlds.
9367620	9370620	But is there really a line there?
9370620	9377620	Yeah, there is a line. Basically, we have in our society strong norms against torturing others to death.
9377620	9380620	And these norms are not ubiquitous in nature.
9381620	9385620	I would say that torture isn't necessarily ubiquitous in nature.
9385620	9387620	Chimps hurt each other.
9387620	9390620	They hurt each other, but torture is different than hurt.
9390620	9396620	A lot of animals that die are dying in extremely torturous death.
9396620	9408620	And when you look at how predators kill their prey, it's not necessarily happening in such a way that it minimizes the pain and bad experiences for the prey involved.
9409620	9415620	That's different than torture, which is optimized to create the worst possible experience.
9415620	9421620	I think that torture is not something that exists in the animal kingdom. I think that it's something that is a creation of humans.
9421620	9426620	Like in torture, you try to keep your subject alive as long as possible to endure maximal suffering.
9426620	9427620	Like cats.
9429620	9439620	Unfortunately, yes. But even with cats, I don't see it as being an intentional sort of destruction.
9439620	9444620	I always think that it's a surprise when the toy breaks.
9445620	9454620	Like it's it's just a visceral animal stupidity where I think that she doesn't understand what causes hurt.
9454620	9456620	No, I think it's actual joy.
9458620	9469620	Yes, I suspect that basically there are sometimes situations where a predator does enjoy inflicting pain on something that doesn't want to be hurt because it's part of this visceral experience.
9470620	9473620	It's incompatible with our sheep like domestication.
9473620	9481620	So we recoil at the thought of it so hard that we don't want to entertain the possibility that the predator actually enjoys killing and hurting and maiming.
9483620	9485620	But we also see this sometimes in humans.
9485620	9488620	And I think that humans in this regard are also just a type of animal.
9488620	9490620	There are animals which don't enjoy that.
9490620	9492620	There are animals which do.
9492620	9494620	And a similar thing is happening for humans.
9494620	9497620	They're basically humans which do enjoy inflicting pain.
9497620	9499620	There are humans which enjoy killing.
9499620	9505620	And it's also obvious by that under some circumstances, this would be adaptive given the right environment.
9506620	9521620	And so the fact that there are those humans and the fact that the environment does have this moral valence that's attached to it for me makes it impossible to talk about the technology that we're developing without thinking about the morality of it
9521620	9524620	and without thinking about the eventual outcomes.
9524620	9536620	Because I think that both you and Shiloh are right when you say that there is this gradient between natural and unnatural and there are the things that humans make and we tend to view them as being outside of nature.
9536620	9550620	But that's not really a useful way of looking at it because there is the argument that you can make that the burning of fossil fuels and the production of carbon is actually something that the planet needs in order to produce the kind of biome
9550620	9554620	that is then able to make megalodons that wander the Earth.
9555620	9562620	And so when we make technology, because we are at the point where we can conceptualize the future impacts of that technology,
9563620	9578620	it is in our best interests to consider the ways in which that technology can fail us and what it will do to us if it fails in order to push it into the direction where it produces the outcome that seems better to us.
9578620	9582620	Because you're right that it's not possible to look into the future and know what the outcome will be.
9582620	9589620	But anybody that makes decisions without any consideration for weighing, okay, these are the pros of this decision, these are the cons.
9589620	9593620	And then you roll the dice in the hopes that the outcome will be what you want.
9594620	9598620	Anybody who doesn't do that is usually screwed by the universe pretty quickly.
9598620	9605620	Like there's almost nobody who succeeds just by randomly rolling the dice with just come what may.
9605620	9621620	And so when we talk about the impact of new technologies, I think that it's important to recognize that it's possible for them to lead us down the road to the matrix where our brains are the computational subunits of an enormous supercomputer that is the Gaia computer.
9622620	9630620	And if we are to domesticate ourselves in that way, how do we mold the technology to not be the factory farm?
9631620	9642620	And so I don't know how to differentiate between that and the moral personal quality of it.
9642620	9644620	Do you think that it's necessary to you?
9644620	9646620	It's a very interesting question.
9646620	9653620	There has been a serious sense of anarchy that is trying to deal with the question of how to relate to the corporate state.
9653620	9662620	It's an adaptation of Hamlet that is dramatizing the history of Motorcycle Club in California.
9662620	9667620	Hells Angels that are picturized in a slightly different version.
9667620	9671620	And they are portrayed as a serious anarchist project that is trying to...
9671620	9672620	What is this called?
9672620	9673620	Sons of Anarchy.
9673620	9674620	Sons of Anarchy.
9675620	9682620	It basically pictures how they are trying to live a life outside of the legal system, outside of the state,
9682620	9690620	outside of the structures of money that comes into the local communities and turns everything into change
9690620	9695620	that extracts economic value out of the local communities and sends it somewhere to New York.
9697620	9699620	So they try to build their own structures.
9699620	9710620	And they fail dramatically because to survive, basically what they do is they sell pornography, prostitution and guns, eventually drugs.
9710620	9717620	The negotiation outside of the legal system works via some kind of tribal democracy
9717620	9722620	where the different tribes are fighting against each other to fight over territory.
9722620	9728620	And their internal negotiations devolve into more and more violence until the whole thing breaks down.
9728620	9736620	And so in some sense, it's also a philosophical project that is undertaken in a series where they try to reflect on what's the alternative
9736620	9744620	to the organized society that necessarily gets corrupted and captured by the largest economic agents in it.
9744620	9751620	And the tentative answer that this thing gets to without being superjudgmental, it mostly looks like explorative,
9751620	9757620	is that for the time being, the corporate Kraken is still giving better results.
9757620	9759620	There's not really an alternative to it.
9759620	9766620	And so basically it takes a reformist perspective rather than the attempt to build something new from scratch.
9766620	9776620	And the attempts that we've seen to build something new from scratch, like the non-police zone in Seattle and so on, they all led into disaster very quickly.
9778620	9783620	It's very difficult to build something outside of the system or to reboot the system easily.
9783620	9785620	And we haven't found a good solution for this.
9785620	9793620	But if we zoom out of it, it's still chimps doing their best to get the best possible chimps society under the circumstances of evolution,
9793620	9796620	game theory, and the variety of human psychology and incentives.
9796620	9800620	So this is what we are stuck with in some sense.
9800620	9808620	And if we zoom out more, if you look, for instance, into the Miyazaki movies, we have this question of how we relate to Gaia, to life on Earth.
9808620	9819620	As for instance, Cematized and Mononoke, where you have this question of whether we should submit to the cycles of life and death and nature
9819620	9823620	and conceptualize ourselves as part of nature and submit to it.
9823620	9830620	Are we some kind of local tribe that gets killed by nature from time to time or reduced in size or and so on,
9830620	9837620	and it has to play ball in the larger cycles and accept that there are agents larger than humans that have control over us?
9837620	9846620	Or are we going to decapitate this agency in such a way that we can turn nature into a garden and see how far we can go?
9846620	9852620	And right now we are in this mode where we have decapitated nature, where we are no longer part of the natural cycles,
9852620	9855620	whereas there is nothing there that is allowed to eat us.
9855620	9859620	And we see how far we can go with this.
9859620	9865620	And it could be that we cannot sustainably maintain nature as a garden and something else has to take over.
9865620	9872620	But there is also, I think, the big hope that the Gaia that we have so much crippled right now and diminished in her efficacy,
9872620	9878620	this spirit of life on Earth that is no longer able to rein us in and to control us,
9878620	9885620	that it's not only going to not taking over after a major crash in which our population has burned itself out,
9885620	9893620	like swarm of locusts had eaten all the available food and then population collapsing and plants slowly were growing.
9893620	9899620	It's possible that with AI something else is happening, that we become lucid together with these machines
9899620	9904620	that allow us to picture for every action that we are doing what the outcome of this action is,
9904620	9907620	so we can no longer escape the responsibilities of our action.
9907620	9912620	And AI in some sense leads to the production of some kind of hyper Gaia,
9912620	9916620	in which it becomes visible for every choice that you are making,
9916620	9921620	what the outcome of that choice is for the future of everything that you care about.
9922620	9931620	It seems to me that progress in the production of such an idealized hyper Gaia involves repeated collapses,
9931620	9934620	experimentations in organizations that fail.
9934620	9944620	Even if you look at the origin of our own country, it seems to have been an implosion of the previously existing structures,
9944620	9949620	but there was already, it's not like we invented democracy, it's not like we invented the republic.
9949620	9954620	We just honed it a little more, but that required a collapse of sorts in order for that to happen.
9955620	9959620	Do you think that the future will also be punctuated by these sorts of failures,
9959620	9966620	like where the corruptions build up, the captures, the industry captures of the government systems get so disgusting
9966620	9972620	that people turn their back on them in order to move past that and actually solve the problem that they don't have to,
9972620	9975620	in some sense it's reformist because they're building on the previous structures,
9975620	9980620	but they have to actually stop it first in order to keep moving?
9980620	9986620	I suspect that there was no such collapse, at least I don't see what that collapse had been in the US.
9986620	9994620	There had been some kind of colonial architecture and pioneers that dismantled the neolithic tribal civilization,
9994620	10001620	this very low population density, and replaced it with structures that were built based on what existed in Europe.
10001620	10004620	But the structures that were built here were never feudalistic,
10004620	10013620	so there was never a post feudalist revolution that turned this into a capitalist society in which free citizens existed.
10013620	10020620	This was never a society with hereditary castes like existed in the agricultural societies.
10020620	10026620	We had an entire cast of slaves when we built this country, right?
10026620	10032620	That is very true. I don't think it was ubiquitous, but it was a choice that happened,
10032620	10038620	and it was a choice where I think many Europeans said, oh my god, you're doing something that you will come to regret later.
10038620	10044620	There was a reason why most of the European countries did not intend to import slaves into Europe.
10044620	10048620	And so that is part of the legacy that existed in the US.
10048620	10054620	It's also the US from the beginning defined itself as an empire, as an imperialist power,
10054620	10063620	that first of all built a modern structure on the subcontinent and was conquering, competing state-like structures
10063620	10067620	and had to do this in order to win because otherwise something else would have won.
10067620	10072620	And it's something that today is less apparent for most people why you would want to be an empire,
10072620	10077620	and why an empire is actually a good thing to have and to be in and to perpetrate.
10077620	10080620	It's a very different thing to have.
10080620	10088620	And when I grew up in Europe, I was anti-imperialist, and I felt it's wrong to be imperialist because it's a moral violation.
10088620	10093620	Now that I am in the US and I realized that all this peace and anti-imperialism in Europe is only possible
10093620	10100620	because it existed under the American umbrella, I'm much more concerned about the US becoming anti-imperialist
10100620	10106620	because freedom is not something that emerges in the absence of power, but in the balance between powers.
10106620	10112620	But you can see how there was a terrible collapse in our country when we moved past the system of slavery.
10112620	10119620	It's still quite evident if you make a trip to the Deep South, there was a lot of destruction.
10119620	10128620	The way of life for those people was altered in a way that can never be approximated again.
10128620	10135620	I wouldn't say that the abolition of slavery led to a crash and to a downfall,
10135620	10138620	but I'm not able to judge this very much. I'm not really a historian.
10138620	10147620	But my perception of the general narratives were that despite the fears of the anti-abolitionists,
10147620	10155620	the former slaves for the most part didn't starve, didn't have a birth life, and the economy didn't crash.
10155620	10164620	And quality of life did improve for basically everyone in the course of the abolition of slavery.
10164620	10168620	But it cost a lot, right? There was an enormous collapse that happened.
10168620	10179620	Literally half the country seceded from the Union and hundreds of thousands of people died on the battlefields in this collapse that happened.
10179620	10182620	There was a great civil war. It was extremely bloody.
10182620	10190620	And the South had a rough time during the reconstruction of putting themselves back together without that.
10190620	10192620	It was the war, right?
10192620	10206620	I wonder if history is necessarily punctuated by these sorts of tumultuous upheavals
10206620	10212620	in order to reconstitute something which is stronger and more well aligned with our humanity.
10212620	10215620	This is something that I really don't understand well enough.
10216620	10222620	I know several historical narratives with respect to the importance of the abolitionist movement and the war.
10222620	10227620	There was an interaction between the two, but it was probably not entirely monoprosal.
10227620	10231620	And I suspect that secessions can happen for many reasons.
10231620	10239620	And if another secession would happen, yes, I think the military, due to its monopoly on violence, would be able to stop it much faster.
10239620	10247620	But back then, the idea that the state should be counterbalanced by local militias made secession much more likely.
10247620	10256620	It's still part of the constitution that there is the right to form local militias in some sense, which is reflected in the right to bear arms.
10256620	10259620	But the US is no longer serious about it.
10259620	10271620	Because there seems to be a consensus that secessionist war is worse than the oppression that exists by a central government that might lead to more corruption.
10271620	10274620	It's not a complete consensus.
10274620	10284620	There are still people who feel that they should have the right to bear arms against the central government and to secede and to impose their own rule of law outside of the federal consensus.
10284620	10289620	But this is something where the majority of the country seems to be opposed against.
10289620	10295620	But it's a difficult question of how our society is to be constructed.
10295620	10303620	It's relatively hard also to make trajectories based on new decisions that somebody has come up with, new philosophies.
10303620	10309620	I know a number of people who believe that California should secede, and I know many people who think that would be insanity.
10310620	10319620	I see the secession boundaries as not being clearly delineated on a geographic landscape like they were in the last Civil War,
10319620	10328620	where we have a population outside of the cities that's very alienated from the population inside the cities.
10328620	10331620	And it's about a 50-50 split.
10331620	10338620	The electoral map, and granted there's a huge silent group of people who don't vote.
10338620	10341620	I think like 50% of people vote in elections.
10341620	10349620	But I think that you're right that there's this massive cleavage and it's not unbalanced in the sense of just sheer numbers.
10350620	10362620	Yeah, and you're absolutely right that the US military and their drones, a few guys with AR-15s are no match for a drone, let's put it that way.
10362620	10372620	But at the same time, you could still imagine a situation where the descent among the masses that were not necessarily geographically isolated,
10372620	10381620	but mixed into the population was so strong that you would have some catastrophic collapse of civil life as a result of it,
10381620	10388620	which would be necessary if the infractions became so grave to the people that felt disenfranchised by the current structures.
10388620	10396620	And I would go so far as to say that the lines of that disenfranchisement will fall along technological adoption.
10396620	10404620	Yeah, people out here in the country really hate all this tech stuff, honestly.
10404620	10407620	Except for our septic guy, he really likes chat GPT.
10407620	10408620	That's true.
10408620	10416620	When I grew up in Germany, I grew up in the countryside and I noticed the resentment of the country against the cities.
10416620	10422620	And because I grew up in the countryside, I could see it not just from the perspective of the cities.
10423620	10430620	The Green Party, for instance, was something that strangely never found much traction in the countryside, its green.
10430620	10437620	And in large part because the Green Party was by its milieu open for fashion.
10437620	10442620	And most of them thought that having a car is really stupid, just this first environment.
10442620	10449620	And if you need to own a car, it means you have the wrong lifestyle and you should move into the city like them and live the same life as them.
10450620	10455620	And if you are living in an area outside of the reach of public transport, we need to change this.
10455620	10459620	This notion that public transport only makes sense when you have a certain population density.
10459620	10467620	And outside of that population density, it makes more economical sense if you have one or two cars, if you live in the countryside.
10467620	10473620	But this is a minor example or the way in which our food is being produced in the countryside.
10473620	10480620	There is a discrepancy between the way in which the Green Party saw this and the way in which the farmers who produced the food saw this.
10480620	10487620	And so basically farmers, for the most part, never elected the Green Party or were attracted to them.
10487620	10492620	They had other concerns. They felt that they had been living in this place for many, many generations.
10492620	10499620	And they built a very complex social structure over these generations with very strong interpersonal oversight.
10499620	10505620	So it's much more multicellular than the single-celled life in the cities where everybody is in the nutritional substrate.
10505620	10513620	And as country life requires much more submission to shared social norms than the city does,
10513620	10520620	where the coupling between the individuals despite or because of the higher density of people living is much looser.
10520620	10526620	It's the same thing that people caught in an elevator have less interaction with each other.
10527620	10532620	So this being together at this close space becomes bearable for them.
10532620	10535620	Then it would be in a village where everybody is spaced out,
10535620	10543620	but everybody intimately tracks all the interactions of everybody else and builds reputation systems around this that reach over many generations.
10543620	10547620	And so this is something that is hard to see from the cities.
10547620	10555620	And yet the country is governed from the cities and the food that actually is being needed is produced in the countryside.
10555620	10563620	And that is something that basically the cities are being able to appropriate what is being produced in the countryside,
10563620	10566620	the colonizing entities that live on the country.
10566620	10570620	And they are mostly ruled by producing paper that they shift around.
10570620	10581620	And this rule of paper over producing food from the ground is something that is very apparent for the people in the countryside and not so much apparent for the people in the city.
10581620	10587620	And part of that in the U.S. is reflected by this notion of the people in the countryside that they want to have arms,
10587620	10596620	to have a symbolic boundary against the world of paper that they basically can say, OK, you can push us, but you can only push us so far.
10596620	10601620	There is a point at which you're going to break and you'll regret what's going to happen.
10601620	10603620	It is this attention that exists in the U.S.
10603620	10610620	The media are completely controlled by people who are not in the countryside, but in the cities,
10610620	10615620	people who had a very homogenous education and had a very homogenous worldview,
10615620	10623620	that have a very homogenous perspective on what's good and bad in the world and for which many of the other people just live and fly over country.
10623620	10630620	And these other people are no longer represented in the media or resent the fact that they don't feel their perspectives being presented.
10630620	10637620	And this creates enormous tension. And I guess that's normal in all the countries that have urbanization.
10637620	10644620	I just think that beyond paper, it's also a technological cleavage,
10644620	10654620	because the vision of the technological system that I see is a progressive increase in machine capability
10655620	10662620	that functionally dissociates people from the landscape, where you have fully mechanized farms,
10662620	10671620	where maybe one or two programmers are running the machines and dealing with all of the software problems.
10671620	10677620	And everything that you need to know about agriculture is algorithmically encoded.
10677620	10680620	The machines can test the soil as they work it.
10680620	10685620	There are sensors in the ground that are perfectly capable of knowing everything that the plants do.
10685620	10689620	And you don't need the farmer anymore. You don't need the people that are on the landscape anymore.
10689620	10695620	So in a city, what now happens is that you have a growth of administration jobs.
10695620	10700620	You get situations where you have more administrators than doctors,
10700620	10704620	and in some regions more administrators than patients in a hospital.
10704620	10707620	And this didn't happen in the agriculture, right?
10707620	10716620	It's not that the farms have enormous amount of unionized administrators who are able to extract resources from society.
10716620	10721620	But there is a power imbalance between those who wield the paper and those who don't.
10721620	10730620	And the resolution of this requires us to think about how technology is going to press on the people
10730620	10734620	that are in the country that are not vested in it.
10734620	10739620	Because I see a distinct differential between the people who work in tech
10739620	10742620	and the way they feel about the technology that they're building,
10742620	10746620	versus the people who don't work in tech and are somehow associated with the landscape.
10746620	10754620	And with each new development that pushes technology into the forefront,
10754620	10757620	into the center of the way that we organize society,
10757620	10761620	the people that live on the outskirts feel more and more pressured.
10761620	10768620	And I feel like if we're not careful in the way that we develop, deploy this technology,
10768620	10778620	that we're going to create a terrible collapse point where it will return to this visceral animalistic struggle
10778620	10781620	that the people in the cities aren't going to want.
10781620	10784620	Like it's a very real feeling I have living in the countryside.
10785620	10788620	Because I think that there's something about living in nature
10788620	10792620	that connects you to the place in a fundamental way.
10792620	10795620	Like we were in the woods yesterday and I kind of realized that
10795620	10799620	there's something about a landscape that breeds nationalism.
10799620	10804620	If you live on a beautiful landscape, you associate yourself with it,
10804620	10810620	and you become an integrated part of that landscape.
10810620	10815620	And to bring in technology that removes you from that landscape feels like a violation
10815620	10821620	because the technology can't possibly provide you with the same feeling that you get
10821620	10825620	when you plunge into an ice cold, pristine river.
10825620	10829620	And the people that live in the country are terrified of losing that,
10829620	10832620	and the people that live in the city don't have access to it.
10832620	10835620	And so they're like, but the technology will allow us to emulate it,
10835620	10838620	and it's going to improve everybody's quality of life.
10838620	10842620	I also want to add that it's not just a matter of whether the people
10842620	10846620	and the country's revolution would be successful per se,
10846620	10852620	but that they could make the country so miserable and so locked down militarily
10852620	10856620	that everybody else was so disgusted with the entire affair,
10856620	10860620	that the entire government structure was forced into reorganization
10860620	10864620	according to the alignment with the population in general.
10864620	10867620	The outcome of that would probably be somewhat uncertain,
10867620	10871620	because it's difficult to build new governmental structures within a generation
10871620	10874620	that work in such a way that people are happy with it.
10874620	10877620	I would want to live in the countryside.
10877620	10880620	I much prefer being out there in nature.
10880620	10882620	It's much more healthy for me and sustainable.
10882620	10887620	But I am living in cities due to a need for intellectual stimulation,
10887620	10889620	so I need to be in these concentrated places.
10889620	10891620	For me, it's a choice.
10891620	10894620	And it's not necessarily a choice for most people to be like this.
10894620	10898620	I would still have this issue that it feels harder to sustain myself on the countryside,
10898620	10902620	but I think I'd keep myself busy and be able to open a restaurant
10902620	10907620	or there are a lot of things that you can do there to survive.
10907620	10909620	It's just going to be different.
10909620	10911620	You have to perform different things.
10911620	10913620	But at scale, the same options are not available.
10913620	10918620	At scale, most of the employment does exist in few concentrated cities.
10918620	10922620	And the outskirts of these cities, urban metro areas.
10922620	10926620	And a similar thing happened, for instance, in the Middle Ages
10926620	10930620	or at the end of the Middle Ages when the industrialization happened
10930620	10933620	and the mechanization of agriculture began.
10933620	10937620	And what happened then was that many farmers were forced to move into the city
10937620	10940620	to find employment in the new manufactories
10940620	10943620	because they were no longer required to work the fields
10943620	10945620	because they now had tractors.
10945620	10950620	They had lots of machines that were making the work on the farms much, much easier.
10950620	10954620	You didn't need that much personal anymore to do that backbreaking labor.
10954620	10959620	And after a few generations, people ended up doing far less backbreaking labor.
10959620	10962620	Tide labor in the manufacturers was abolished and so on.
10962620	10965620	Worker protections were introduced.
10965620	10969620	And people had washing machines and cooking utensils and so on
10969620	10971620	that made everyday life much, much easier.
10971620	10975620	People didn't need to get up at very ugly hours of the night
10975620	10981620	and to survive, perform acts that provided the physical risk to them.
10981620	10985620	And also the agriculture became much more pleasant to work in
10985620	10987620	because of its high degree of mechanization.
10987620	10993620	The amount of physical labor that was involved was reduced dramatically.
10993620	10997620	And so you could say that there is an enormous loss that happened to many people
10997620	11002620	when they had to move from the countryside into the more alienating environment of the cities.
11002620	11006620	But the conclusion is not in the moral that there is a resolution to this,
11006620	11012620	that there is a way for us to fix this, that there must be a perfect aesthetic for this.
11012620	11016620	Yeah, I find it impossible to not have opinions about politics.
11016620	11020620	But I also realized that there are often immature
11020620	11024620	and I have less agency over them than I have about opinions about politics.
11024620	11029620	I have less agency over them than I have about opinions in philosophical domains.
11029620	11034620	And I think this makes them inferior as opinions go.
11034620	11037620	Because if I have too little agency over these opinions,
11037620	11043620	they don't mean very much beyond my own biographical accidents.
11043620	11046620	Of course, my biography is shaping my opinions.
11046620	11049620	The way in which I grew up, my starting point in the world,
11049620	11053620	the things that happened to me afterwards are influencing a great deal of what I'm seeing.
11053620	11056620	And also what I'm not seeing.
11056620	11059620	And so I find whenever I have an opinion about something
11059620	11063620	and there are smarter people than me that have very different opinions about this,
11063620	11067620	I need to take a step back and realize that there is a possibility space for opinions.
11067620	11072620	And am I able to capture this space correctly and accurately?
11072620	11075620	And for me, it's much more interesting to open the space
11075620	11079620	than to just look at a single opinion and declare this my own.
11079620	11084620	Because it basically means that your opinion is making me its own.
11084620	11086620	And for political opinions, that's much harder.
11086620	11090620	Because if you tell people that there is an alternative to their political opinion,
11090620	11094620	they mostly get offended due to the nature of political opinions.
11094620	11098620	And so I find these types of discussions unproductive.
11098620	11102620	And they also lead to a situation for very little gain.
11102620	11106620	You are making a lot of enemies, regardless of what your political opinion is,
11106620	11109620	certainly because of the fact that it is going to be different
11109620	11112620	from the particular opinion of many other people.
11112620	11115620	Alright, so can we completely backflip then
11115620	11120620	and get back to what drew us into this conversation in the first place,
11120620	11126620	which is the proposed hard problem of consciousness.
11126620	11131620	Because I think neither one of us is convinced that there is a hard problem of consciousness.
11131620	11134620	Yes, please, let's go into the real topic.
11134620	11138620	Let's cut out all the other parts.
11138620	11145620	So I think our starting point in this conversation was that you remarked on Twitter, Nastasia,
11145620	11149620	that you are confused about the hard problem of consciousness.
11149620	11157620	And what confused you is not the usual thing that people wonder why consciousness is so hard and unexplainable.
11157620	11161620	But rather to you, it seems to be relatively straightforward to explain,
11161620	11163620	and everybody else claims it's hard.
11163620	11169620	And nobody else was yet at the same time able to explain to you why it is hard.
11169620	11175620	And I was told that you can explain to me why it is hard, so I look forward to it.
11175620	11179620	I don't know what you think about Daniel Dennett.
11179620	11186620	I have read enough Dennett to feel like he's not a biologist,
11186620	11196620	and so I am confused because his posing of the hard problem doesn't seem to have a biological basis.
11196620	11200620	Do you think that there's anything wrong in what he writes when he writes Consciousness Explained?
11200620	11206620	Can you guys summarize it for me?
11206620	11209620	Dennett's position.
11209620	11212620	Oh, well, he's a functionalist.
11212620	11215620	Pretty much standard.
11215620	11217620	He says, good writing.
11217620	11220620	I feel there's nothing wrong with what he writes.
11220620	11226620	My position might be different from yours because I don't see magical powers that are afforded by biology.
11226620	11229620	It's still just function that is provided by biology.
11229620	11239620	And I can break down these functions ultimately in state transitions and substrates that form control structure and so on.
11239620	11242620	So it's not opening avenues into something new.
11242620	11247620	There is basically no magical homunculus that is producing consciousness via biology.
11247620	11251620	Biology is just a way to get self-organizing matter.
11251620	11258620	So as far as I understand Dennett's argument is that there's no explanation for the experience of experience.
11258620	11261620	Is that a sufficiently brief form of it?
11261620	11266620	I find that Dennett is one of the few people who doesn't see a hard problem.
11266620	11270620	And mostly has to explain why other people see it.
11270620	11275620	This might be a similarity, but I suspect that you're not having the same perspective.
11275620	11280620	What I found is that Dennett fails to convince a lot of his own students in some sense.
11280620	11283620	And I tried to figure out where that is.
11283620	11291620	And the best explanation that I've come up with so far is that Dennett actually never explains phenomenal experience.
11291620	11299620	And when he discusses qualia, he mostly points at definitional defects in the way in which most philosophers treat qualia
11299620	11304620	and then says it's probably something that doesn't really exist in the way in which these people define it.
11304620	11307620	So we also don't need to explain it.
11307620	11313620	And a lot of people find this unsatisfying because they say that regardless of how you define it,
11313620	11319620	it's clearly something that they experience, like qualia being the atoms of phenomenal experience
11319620	11322620	or aspects of phenomenal experience or features of phenomenal experience.
11322620	11325620	It doesn't really matter how you define it. It's there.
11325620	11330620	And please explain it to me because I don't see how an unthinking, unfeeling mechanical universe
11330620	11335620	is going to produce this wealth of experience that I'm confronted with.
11335620	11340620	Physics does not seem to be able to explain why something is happening to me.
11340620	11343620	Why is me here? Why is there experience?
11343620	11349620	And this is something that some people feel is poorly addressed by Dennett.
11349620	11354620	I mean, there's this philosophical zombie experiment, right?
11354620	11360620	Which is that you can have someone who acts and behaves as if they are conscious,
11360620	11366620	but there's no internal process of experience that leads them to behave as if they are conscious.
11366620	11373620	And so you have a problem where it's possible that everybody that you're surrounded by are not having a conscious experience.
11373620	11376620	You're the only one who's having the conscious experience.
11376620	11382620	And so we have this hard problem because you have no way of evaluating whether or not that person is having an experience
11382620	11385620	or just behaving as if they have an experience.
11385620	11388620	So let's see. We have a philosophical zombie in front of us.
11388620	11393620	And we are asking this philosophical zombie who in every regard acts like a human being
11393620	11399620	because his brain implements all the necessary functionality, just mechanically and not magically.
11399620	11403620	Are you conscious? What is the zombie going to respond?
11403620	11407620	What do you mean about the fact that the brain reproduces all of the effects?
11407620	11413620	The idea of the philosophical zombie is that the philosophical zombie is producing everything
11413620	11418620	without giving rise to phenomenal experience, just mechanical.
11418620	11420620	Based on the intuition that...
11420620	11423620	What does that mean? I don't understand what that means.
11423620	11429620	I think the intuition is that phenomenal experience is something that cannot be explained through causal structure, through mechanisms.
11429620	11433620	But why do we think that? I don't understand why we possibly think that.
11433620	11436620	That's what I mean about not understanding the hard problem of consciousness.
11436620	11443620	Because I'm like, look, this is why my definition of life as beginning before the cell is instrumental to eliminating the hard problem of consciousness.
11443620	11452620	Because if you have in the most basic cell, which is an embodiment of the state of matter that is life,
11452620	11457620	you have a resonant state, which is electromagnetic. It's the redox state.
11457620	11464620	And the cell needs to maintain that electrical resonance at a specific set point, because if it does not, it dies.
11464620	11472620	And so it is going out into the world and it is constantly controlling where it is in the world relative to its internal state.
11472620	11481620	And as you progressively produce more and more complex beings, you get a more and more complex map of the world and a more and more complex internal state.
11481620	11489620	And so by the time that you have a thinking, a walking human, you cannot have a walking human without an internal state.
11489620	11498620	It's a philosophical thought experiment that requires you to divorce yourself from everything that you know about biology in order to make the claim.
11498620	11506620	And I just feel like you can't do that because the biology is inherently what produces the conscious.
11506620	11512620	It's the state of matter that produces the consciousness and all of the resonant waves that are inside of it.
11512620	11521620	And so if you have the resonant waves in the sufficient complexity of a sufficiently resonant system
11521620	11529620	that is interpreting the world relative to itself and to what it wants, how can you have anything except for consciousness?
11530620	11540620	You have experience, you have the mapping of expectation to frustration, and it just emerges from the most basic cell.
11540620	11542620	How do resonant waves produce consciousness?
11542620	11543620	Say it again?
11543620	11546620	How do resonant waves produce consciousness?
11546620	11551620	OK, so do you know the Qualia Research Institute?
11551620	11552620	Yes.
11552620	11554620	So what is their work?
11554620	11562620	Their work is that they're basically showing that there are harmonic states in the brain that are associated with experience.
11562620	11570620	I think that they're mostly trying to use psychedelics for intellectual gain.
11570620	11572620	Yeah, but like if you...
11572620	11574620	I think it's similar to the question...
11574620	11577620	They don't produce causal models of how consciousness is being produced, I think.
11577620	11584620	I think that they're not producing causal models, but I think that their experiments show something interesting.
11584620	11585620	What were you going to say, Shay?
11585620	11593620	I was going to say the question seems akin to asking how do fundamental waves produce music,
11593620	11598620	which emerges from all of these individual tones.
11598620	11605620	But the same thing with conscious experience is you have the summing of different modules within the neuron-based systems
11605620	11611620	that are all aggregating and fighting and resonating with one another, and you get music that comes out of it.
11614620	11617620	And you don't see an explanatory problem there?
11617620	11621620	No, I mean, I can see a mathematical problem.
11621620	11625620	I can see that it would be very, very difficult to mathematize the way that that resonance...
11625620	11627620	The thing is math just isn't explanatory.
11627620	11629620	It has zero explanatory power by itself.
11629620	11636620	You have to have that linguistic conceptualization overlaid on top of mathematics in order to make sense of it.
11636620	11639620	Linguistic explanations have no explanatory power.
11639620	11640620	This is just words.
11640620	11641620	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
11641620	11643620	How can you use words to explain anything?
11643620	11645620	How can you use math to explain anything?
11645620	11647620	You can't write me an equation to explain anything.
11647620	11650620	Math can only describe what's happening.
11650620	11654620	It cannot tell me what causes the actor to do the thing that it does.
11654620	11658620	And it can't even tell me what the actors are using the math.
11658620	11661620	The math has to be qualified with linguistic descriptors.
11661620	11665620	They're the most powerful symbolism that we've developed as a technology.
11665620	11669620	Like, I think that a great example of this is that we don't have...
11669620	11670620	Excuse me.
11670620	11675620	We don't have an explanation for gravity, but we do have a great description for it.
11675620	11676620	So the math is there.
11676620	11678620	Or the atom.
11678620	11679620	Yeah.
11679620	11681620	There's a bunch of explanations for gravity.
11681620	11685620	It's just that we have not completely converged on a single one.
11686620	11691620	There may be an explanation for gravity that's outside the context of this conversation,
11691620	11696620	but the most popular theory of gravity is not an explanation at all.
11696620	11701620	It's a description of how objects behave gravitationally with respect to one another.
11701620	11705620	Relativism is fundamentally a description of what's happening.
11705620	11707620	It's not an explanation of what's happening.
11707620	11710620	It doesn't actually tell me what's holding my body to the floor.
11710620	11714620	It's just telling me that my body will be held to the floor in this particular fashion.
11715620	11722620	There's a theory that describes the evolution of locations in space-time.
11722620	11725620	It does describe them, but that doesn't explain anything.
11725620	11729620	The nice thing is that it reduces it to something that is much more simple.
11729620	11734620	And from this thing that is much more simple, you get your feet being pressed to the floor.
11734620	11737620	But it doesn't explain what...
11737620	11741620	The mathematics allows you to derive it from something that is simpler.
11741620	11746620	And deriving something from something that's simpler, I think, is what qualifies as an explanation.
11746620	11751620	It doesn't mean that you still have to deal with this thing that is simpler now.
11751620	11757620	Well, you have to deal with what are the physical objects doing to pull my atoms towards the ground.
11757620	11764620	And that is something that is completely overlooked when you're reliant upon a purely mathematical conception of the phenomenon,
11764620	11767620	because all you can do is look at how it's happening.
11767620	11770620	You're not able to tell me the mechanism by which that occurs.
11770620	11775620	You're not able to show me the structures of the atom that are capable of pulling on one another.
11775620	11777620	And that's what's necessary to make a true physical explanation.
11777620	11782620	But let's not do this today, because I think it would completely sidetrack us for a couple of hours.
11782620	11790620	But I think that the question of explanation versus description and how do you actually come to understand something
11790620	11793620	is central to this question about the hard problem of consciousness.
11793620	11801620	Because I'm like, look, if the challenge is that you don't understand how to mathematically encode the various resonance states
11801620	11807620	that results in an experience, I will accept that that is difficult.
11807620	11815620	But it seems obvious to me, especially with Grossberg's work, that resonance is the foundation of consciousness.
11815620	11821620	And that that resonance begins at the cell and progressively becomes a more and more complex wave
11821620	11823620	by the time that it gets to a brain.
11823620	11833620	And so if you have that as your starting point, then your complex challenge is to figure out the mathematical descriptors
11833620	11840620	and the sorts of states that have to go into your model in order to produce the desired outcome.
11840620	11845620	But you don't have this thing of like, how can I possibly know if another entity is conscious?
11845620	11847620	Because it's like, well, does it have the hardware?
11847620	11849620	And if it has the hardware, then your answer is yes.
11849620	11852620	If its hardware is broken, then probably not.
11852620	11859620	So it seems to me that your confusion is a different one than the disagreement that some people have with Dennett.
11859620	11864620	The issue with Dennett is that he does not address phenomenon experience head on, apparently.
11864620	11866620	Perhaps he doesn't have a lot of it.
11866620	11871620	Maybe he has a fantasia with respect to phenomenon experience and mostly gets conceptual representations
11871620	11875620	that for him are completely satisfactorily described linguistically.
11876620	11880620	But before we can proceed, I suspect we would need to resolve something else,
11880620	11884620	and that is the relationship between language, meaning, and mathematics.
11884620	11889620	I don't think that we have a shared understanding there, which makes it very hard for us to proceed.
11889620	11897620	So when you talk about harmonic waves producing a phenomenon, for me that's very far from a causal explanation.
11897620	11903620	So it's something that is very unsatisfying to me because I cannot build this.
11903620	11906620	For me, a causal explanation is something I can make.
11906620	11911620	And if you look at the world of the objects around you, the physical world,
11911620	11915620	I can make something that looks a lot like this in a computer.
11915620	11923620	Every phenomenon that can be specified and that can be described in an experiment, I can recreate this in a computer.
11923620	11925620	It might be difficult to scale it up.
11925620	11932620	It might be difficult to solve all the puzzles involved to get from quantum effects to relativistic space-time and so on.
11932620	11935620	It's one of the big unresolved puzzles so far.
11935620	11940620	But a number of people are working on it and think they are very close to having a solution to it.
11940620	11948620	This can all be described in a framework where we use finite automata inside of a computer to perform mathematical transitions.
11948620	11956620	And what they explain is the causal structure of elements that I get when I decompose the universe into separate objects.
11957620	11962620	That is a perspective that I introduce by introducing boundaries between objects in my model.
11962620	11966620	And then I'm able to make the universe manageable.
11966620	11974620	And so, for instance, I can create boundaries between elementary particles along the atoms
11974620	11980620	and say that the atoms are separate objects despite being forces between the atoms that make them not completely separate.
11980620	11986620	And there being entanglement in shared states in groups of atoms under certain circumstances and so on.
11986620	11990620	It makes it harder to create these boundaries correctly.
11990620	11999620	But this is sufficient to get to the next level of abstraction and say, OK, what the molecules afford you and the atoms afford you is mechanisms.
11999620	12004620	And using mechanics, you can produce dynamic state transitions in systems and you can build control systems.
12004620	12009620	And once you have control systems, you can also build control systems that don't just regulate the present
12009620	12015620	but also regulate the future. But in order to regulate the future, they need to represent stuff that isn't there, right?
12015620	12019620	That will be there at some level of post-graining, but it's currently not present.
12019620	12026620	So you need to have a system that is causally insulating part of your mechanical structure from the present structure of the universe.
12026620	12028620	You can use it as a representation, right?
12028620	12035620	Your computer is going to represent stuff that is not currently part of its environment that is different from what the universe is doing at the time.
12035620	12042620	And the computer is the principle to produce this causal insulation of a representational substrate in the environment.
12042620	12047620	So you can represent whatever you want, whatever causal structure and transition you want.
12047620	12052620	When I talk about a wave, a wave is a periodic process, right?
12052620	12057620	There is something like a circle in time. That's what a wave is or an ellipsis in time.
12057620	12062620	And a circle only exists some degree of approximation.
12062620	12069620	What you're really looking at is a process that in some sense is repeating itself in some fundamental way,
12069620	12073620	whereas there's also variation in it in some fundamental way.
12073620	12078620	So something is changing over the different courses of the oscillations in your waves.
12078620	12083620	And sometimes there's not much changing when you look at, say, photon progressing.
12083620	12089620	You can describe this as a periodic process that can be mathematically formalized as a wave equation.
12089620	12093620	And that's why physicists call it a wave under some circumstances.
12093620	12099620	But there is not much changing during the evolution of the wave, but the progression of the photon.
12099620	12101620	So the photon doesn't decay.
12101620	12109620	But if you look at a wave in your brain or a wave on the surface of a pool in your backyard, this one is degrading.
12109620	12114620	There is a periodic process going on, but there's also friction going on, dissipation of information.
12114620	12121620	So it's only an approximation of a thing happening for a certain amount of time that allows you to characterize it as a periodic process.
12121620	12126620	This periodic process can be described as the interaction between molecules, for instance.
12126620	12135620	And now when you think about this, how does the interaction between molecules that you can formalize using a wave equation explain consciousness?
12135620	12138620	I don't think that you have made a very good job yet.
12138620	12142620	I'm still looking at something that looks like a very complicated puzzle.
12142620	12145620	OK, so you look at something.
12145620	12152620	You said something earlier in the conversation where you said that the job of life is to harvest negentropy.
12152620	12157620	So I immediately in the context of a wave think about sonication.
12157620	12159620	Have you ever sonicated anything?
12159620	12160620	No.
12160620	12166620	So a sonicator is an ultrasound probe that you put into a liquid and it breaks things up into smaller parts.
12166620	12171620	And so immediately you have that a wave actually can do work on the world.
12171620	12174620	And so it's in its most pure and simple form.
12174620	12180620	You can use a wave to break matter up into smaller pieces.
12182620	12186620	But what the wave actually is, the wave is not an object.
12186620	12189620	The wave is a way to think about interaction between molecules.
12189620	12197620	What's actually happening is that what you are inducing is a change in the velocity of a bunch of molecules that bump into other molecules.
12198620	12211620	And the progression of that movement can be focused in such a way that the intensity of the velocity change is higher in some region that is remote from the emitter.
12211620	12220620	And so you take a bunch of emitters and you focus the emission of the velocity changes in such a way that there is a point away from your ultrasound emitter.
12221620	12230620	You have a lot more energy focused in one small area where basically the molecules are moving much faster and with more divergence on the objects that you want to break up.
12230620	12236620	And you transmit this energy into the object that you want to break up, but still all just moving molecules.
12236620	12240620	And I think that it's the same process that's happening inside of the body.
12240620	12242620	You're still just moving molecules.
12242620	12253620	But they move in a way that is at the end of their path of travel directed and concentrated in such a way that results in action.
12253620	12266620	And so if you have that as your most basic form of function, the wave is a thing that happens inside the molecules of the body.
12266620	12272620	And that wave starts to happen when you're a bacteria and you are in a soup and you don't have enough food.
12272620	12276620	And the way that you operate is through Brownian motion.
12276620	12283620	And you spin your flagella until you get a molecule and your flagella starts to spin in a direction where you continue to travel.
12283620	12289620	But then you dissociate the molecule and then you spin randomly until you find another one.
12289620	12292620	And that way you gradually work your way up the concentration gradient.
12292620	12302620	That's the same process by which experience is managed inside of a human body, except for the fact that it's far more complicated.
12302620	12306620	What you're still looking at, of course, is the flagella is the robot.
12306620	12308620	The cell is a robot in a sense.
12308620	12316620	It's all just molecules enacting certain kinds of mechanisms that are producing a desired behavior in an entirely mechanical way.
12316620	12323620	And what most people seem to be confused about is that they don't see how a mechanism can have experience.
12323620	12333620	Well, it's because the OK, so I personally think that the cell has experience.
12333620	12339620	Like, I think that a bacteria, when it is about to die, feels that it is about to die.
12339620	12340620	Why?
12340620	12346620	Because I think that it experiences redox stress and that's electrical and you can feel electricity.
12346620	12350620	But why is there a self in the bacterium?
12350620	12366620	So the self is something that requires multiple, like progressively more complex modules that come together that are able to form an external representation of the environment and then relay that onto their place in it.
12366620	12369620	So I agree that the self is more complicated than what the bacteria has.
12369620	12374620	But I don't think that you have to have a conception of self to have an experience.
12374620	12376620	That's the fundamental problem.
12376620	12378620	Like, the experience predates the self.
12378620	12385620	This is tantamount obvious because animals that don't have a sense of self still have experience.
12385620	12398620	And so the idea that the entire theory rests on the emergence of the self out of, like, if you have experience, you must have a self, to me doesn't totally make sense.
12398620	12402620	I think you need to have something like an attentional self to be conscious.
12402620	12406620	And a personal self is something that is developed later and is much more specific.
12406620	12411620	You attribute much more to yourself than the fact that you observe.
12411620	12423620	And also, when you are an attentional self, it doesn't mean that you necessarily have a language in which you can reason about the fact that you observe yourself and you're able to conceptualize yourself in any way.
12423620	12427620	So you can be an entirely preconceptual agent that still is conscious.
12427620	12431620	And the boundary condition of that can probably be seen in dreams.
12431620	12440620	They're basically states in which you do not have a notion of a self beyond the fact that you have some kind of reflexive attention, that you observe yourself observing.
12440620	12455620	And yet it's not clear to me that the bacterium would necessarily be reflexive in this sense, that it has an attentional self that is singling out features in such a way that it's able to act in a model of its own awareness that would make it conscious.
12455620	12459620	And it's not obvious to me that the bacterium would be conscious.
12459620	12463620	But I don't think that without consciousness you can have experience.
12463620	12467620	I think a person that is unconscious doesn't have experience.
12468620	12471620	Do you mean self-awareness by consciousness? Is that what you mean?
12471620	12474620	No, I mean awareness of awareness.
12474620	12483620	So you can also be not aware of yourself by being conscious, even though typically the awareness of the fact that you're aware is only one step away.
12483620	12490620	But you have awareness of content, awareness of the mode of experience and reflexive awareness that usually come together in a conscious system.
12490620	12496620	But without this singling out of features that you're attending to, I don't think that you can be conscious.
12496620	12500620	That seems to be one of the necessary conditions for consciousness.
12500620	12505620	And it's not obvious to me that bacteria have to fulfill this condition to function.
12505620	12513620	Well, I think that it's possible that the bacteria don't fulfill the conditions of a human.
12513620	12516620	I think that to say that they do would be absurd.
12516620	12518620	Yes, but it's not what we are asking for.
12518620	12529620	We are asking for in order to be a functioning bacterium, there's a cellular membrane and some metabolism and the ability to self-replicate and to adapt to some degree to environmental circumstances.
12529620	12538620	For all these robotic functions, it's not obvious that the bacteria needs to be more conscious than a soccer-playing robot, which is not conscious.
12538620	12543620	If you build a robot that plays soccer, the robot is fulfilling a bunch of functions.
12543620	12545620	It's going to model its environment.
12545620	12553620	It's going to figure out where the ball is, where the other robots are, where the goal is, how to get the ball between yourself and the goal, how to push the ball into the goal and so on.
12553620	12557620	So in some functional sense, it's going to have beliefs about the environment.
12557620	12560620	It's going to have commitments about the course of actions.
12560620	12561620	It's going to have co-directed behavior.
12561620	12567620	It's going to have representations about the world with itself inside, but I don't think it experiences anything.
12567620	12578620	But I think that the reason that it doesn't experience anything is because it isn't sufficiently complex, the circuit that's inside the soccer-playing robot.
12578620	12580620	It's not sufficiently flexible.
12580620	12581620	Yeah, that too.
12581620	12583620	Do you want to elaborate on that?
12583620	12592620	Well, it seems to me that in order to conceptualize, you have to be flexible and imagine something that doesn't already exist.
12592620	12596620	And that seems like a difficulty for unconscious entities.
12596620	12606620	So the soccer-playing robot never decides to play rugby, but the bacteria that's eating ethanol can then shift to eating plastic.
12606620	12612620	I'm not sure if bacteria in general have this much choice.
12612620	12619620	I mean, the metabolic flexibility of most bacteria is stunning.
12619620	12625620	They're packaged with the ability to eat a shocking number of substrates.
12625620	12632620	And so there is a choice where if you have an environment that has a bunch of different chemicals in it, you can choose what you eat.
12632620	12646620	The robot, if you teach it to play soccer and you put it in a pen with a bunch of balls, only one of which is a soccer ball, you would have to then program it to pick the soccer ball out and then to play soccer.
12647620	12655620	If you wanted it to be a game-playing robot, you would then have to program it to be able to play whatever game you play with whatever form factor ball, right?
12655620	12659620	You'd have tennis ball, rugby, high lie, whatever.
12659620	12669620	And so in order to get something that even begins to approximate the kind of flexibility of a bacterium, you have to program something that is far more complex than a soccer-playing robot.
12669620	12678620	Because to minimize a bacteria to a soccer-playing robot is to erase the magnificent functional complexity that is inside that little package.
12678620	12688620	I think you are putting too much into your language that is basically inducing you to have a state that makes you more likely to appreciate magic.
12688620	12693620	I think if you take a bacterium and you put it into a novel environment, the bacterium has an experience before.
12693620	12704620	If you just pick an arbitrary bacterium from its normal habitat, put it into a completely new environment where it doesn't find the food that it's used to, it dies.
12704620	12714620	The reason why so many bacteria survive is because you typically don't just pick one, you pick many, many of which have a potential to thrive and they might evolve quickly.
12714620	12720620	Single cell evolution is very quickly, but they need to have a starting point where they can already work with this.
12720620	12724620	And many families of bacteria are able to work over a range of environments.
12724620	12734620	But I suspect that you can have very different degrees of complexity in the bacterium and there are probably bacteria which are really, really stupid and very non-adaptive.
12734620	12739620	And in the same way, you can build a soccer-playing robot that is extremely complex.
12739620	12745620	If you think about the complexity of the systems that people are building, the rates of stable diffusion are just two gigabytes.
12745620	12750620	And they're the result of training on a few hundred million images and text.
12750620	12761620	And they contain all the artistic styles and all celebrities and all the dinosaurs and all the plants and the visual universe that is much larger than the visual universe of a person.
12761620	12763620	And it's only two gigabytes.
12763620	12767620	And it probably far exceeds the ability of a bacterium to recognize the environment.
12767620	12773620	But building two gigabytes into the vision system of a soccer-playing robot doesn't seem to be really daunting.
12773620	12783620	So the complexity that you can build into the soccer-playing robot can be very, very large compared to the complexity of what happens effectively in a human brain.
12783620	12788620	Of course, emulating the functionality of a group of neurons can be very expensive.
12788620	12790620	But how many neurons do you need to run macOS?
12790620	12794620	How many brains would you need to run macOS in a stable way?
12794620	12796620	Probably not that many.
12796620	12798620	I think quite a few.
12798620	12800620	Because neurons are not very deterministic.
12800620	12805620	You would need to create an enormous amount of redundancy to make this happen and to work out.
12805620	12810620	It's basically deterministic structure that you want to build into a brain.
12810620	12812620	It's not working all that well.
12812620	12818620	You can build a vision system with a slow, mushy brain.
12818620	12829620	And still, you would not be able to build in such a way that it's able to, within one week of training, is able to infer the structure of the world from looking at 800 million pictures and captions.
12829620	12832620	This is a task that no biological brain can perform.
12832620	12840620	But what's interesting is the biological brain can perform the task with much less training.
12840620	12841620	Yes.
12841620	12845620	It basically suggests that there's a better algorithm than the one that we're currently using.
12845620	12847620	Yeah, it's the biological one.
12847620	12849620	It's the structure.
12849620	12860620	It's the connection of the wetware to itself that integrates the controller with the executor.
12860620	12866620	And that's kind of my point where it's like any exercise that attempts to explain consciousness without the physical substrate,
12866620	12878620	without recognizing that the physical substrate is mandatory for the effect that we're seeing and is the iterative product of progressive complexity that has been evolving on Earth for the last 4 billion years,
12878620	12889620	will fail to produce consciousness because it is inherent in the structural organization of these different modules that resonate with one another to create complexity.
12889620	12893620	Because I was thinking about this earlier when you said about, you know, the bacteria is really simple.
12893620	12905620	I think you're right, where if we go back to this idea of complex harmonics being the phenomenon of experience, is all these different resonant modes,
12906620	12912620	you can think about what it feels like to listen to a sine wave versus what it feels like to listen to a symphony.
12912620	12924620	They're the same thing, except the sine wave has been modulated into something far more complex and that complex wave has something else in it.
12925620	12935620	I cannot help but feel that when you are describing biology, you are ascribing something to biology that cannot emerge over chemistry.
12935620	12941620	Chemistry or chemistry as properties that cannot be explained by physics.
12941620	12951620	This is not the perspective that I have. For me, everything ultimately gets resolved into state transitions that can be described qualitatively and quantitatively.
12952620	12956620	At no point does magic enter the system.
12956620	12964620	The way in which you describe biology, for me, still has to be reproduced by the mechanisms.
12964620	12970620	I cannot make this claim. I don't see how you can make that claim.
12970620	12974620	I would say that there are bacteria which are very complex in their behavior.
12974620	12978620	Like a stentor is basically a little animal that is hunting other animals.
12978620	12985620	Yet the behavior of the stentor, which is very complex, is not as complicated as the behavior of the soccer-playing robot.
12985620	12989620	The externally observed behavior with respect to the environment.
12989620	12996620	The mechanisms of the soccer-playing robot are much simpler because the soccer-playing robot doesn't need to be self-organizing because I can make it.
12996620	13005620	There doesn't need to be a second-order system that enables the soccer-playing robot to harvest its own energy in the environment from basic foodstuffs
13006620	13012620	and to build its own structure and to repair its own structure after it's been disturbed to self-replicate.
13012620	13019620	Imagine a self-replicating soccer robot. That would be a behavior that no soccer-playing robot can perform.
13019620	13025620	But just the interaction between the environment and playing a ball into a goal is something that I think no bacterium can do.
13026620	13031620	That's an interesting experiment, and I don't know the answer to that.
13031620	13040620	But I immediately think that there is something important in that phenomenon which I think you dismiss kind of easily,
13040620	13045620	which is the self-regulation and the replication and the evolution.
13045620	13054620	Which, when you look at a simple system like a bacterium, it is a seed for the complexity that comes downstream.
13054620	13058620	Because you go from bacterium to biofilm.
13058620	13066620	And in the biofilm, you have an awareness of the environment because you are responding to the environment in an organized way.
13066620	13073620	There's layers in the biofilm that, based off of oxygen penetration, will produce different things.
13073620	13079620	Anastasia, I'm not dismissing this. I want to define the self-organization in such a way that I can decide whether it's present in the system.
13079620	13087620	When you talk about awareness, I ask you to give me a formal definition of awareness that I can apply to any given system to see whether it's present or not.
13087620	13092620	You're just postulating it. You cannot just postulate that the biofilm has awareness of its environment.
13092620	13098620	It's possible, in my perspective, that the biofilm produces the observable behavior without having awareness.
13098620	13101620	It can just mechanically react to it.
13102620	13111620	So, in something that is like the human, if you change...
13111620	13115620	Let's say you put a brain scanner on a human.
13115620	13119620	And this is where the QRI work is interesting.
13119620	13125620	Because there appear to be different states inside the brain that correspond to emotional states.
13125620	13134620	And so, if you are unhappy or you're feeling depressed, there's a different brainwave state that is associated with that experience.
13134620	13141620	And what you can do is you can modulate that brainwave state and induce a different sensation.
13141620	13143620	So, transcranial magnetic stimulation.
13143620	13152620	Did you read about that woman who had intractable depression and then they inserted an electromagnetic pacemaker into the brain that cured her depression?
13153620	13155620	There are a number of phenomena like this.
13155620	13167620	And I think if you look at a computer that is producing a glitch, it's also conceivable that you can build some pacemaker into the computer so the computer no longer produces that glitch.
13167620	13173620	It still doesn't explain how the computer is producing the stuff that is not the glitch.
13173620	13178620	Maybe you want to explain why is my computer displaying a three-dimensional world, something like Minecraft.
13178620	13182620	Why are there colors in Minecraft? Why are there three-dimensional spaces in Minecraft?
13182620	13192620	Now I have to come up with a detailed explanation that explains to you how simple circuits, lots of transistors and so on in the computer can be set up in such a way that they produce these phenomena.
13192620	13199620	And not only that, you can also stop this and make the computer produce music instead in a completely different environment.
13199620	13201620	How is that possible?
13201620	13205620	And this is the kind of phenomenon that we want to explain, also with respect to the mind.
13206620	13211620	We want to explain how is it possible that you are said it's not sufficient to look at some kind of correlate.
13211620	13214620	The correlate itself is not an explanation.
13214620	13221620	To say that in many people who are said this is correlated with these and these brainwaves or with this and this EEG pattern.
13221620	13226620	And if I build a machine that is changing them, you can sometimes see a change, not always.
13226620	13227620	That's not sufficient.
13227620	13232620	You want to have a causal explanation. You want to explain what is actually the phenomenon that you are talking about.
13232620	13234620	What does sadness mean? What is actually sadness?
13234620	13243620	Sadness is an affect that is directed on some source of satisfying a need being permanently removed from your world.
13243620	13244620	You can never get it back.
13244620	13250620	And it's completely crucial to you. You identified the satisfying yourself through this source of satisfaction.
13250620	13252620	And it's gone. It will never come back.
13252620	13255620	This is sadness in some sense.
13255620	13258620	And a stronger form of sadness is grief.
13258620	13260620	It's this paralyzing form of sadness.
13260620	13266620	And sadness leads to certain behaviors, mostly a disengagement with the world because you're helpless.
13266620	13269620	You cannot do anything about it in supplicative behavior.
13269620	13276620	You are appealing to an environment to help you with the situation and to create a solution for a problem for which you're incapable of finding one.
13276620	13283620	And so sadness is some complex psychological phenomena that you can formally define.
13283620	13286620	And the question is, how is it implemented in the brain?
13287620	13293620	And what's also crucial about sadness is that you experience yourself changing as a result of sadness.
13293620	13296620	And without this experience, you wouldn't say that somebody is sad.
13296620	13298620	You would say somebody acts as if they are sad.
13298620	13305620	But there's a difference between acting as if you are sad and actually being sad because that requires an experience of sadness.
13305620	13308620	And so we are coming back to this original question.
13308620	13313620	How is it possible that a system that is mechanically implemented is actually feeling something?
13313620	13317620	And don't say waves that are interacting with each other.
13317620	13323620	That sounds like magical thinking to me because it's not adding anything beyond molecules bumping into each other.
13323620	13325620	And you're saying more complexity.
13325620	13329620	It just means more molecules bumping more complexly into each other.
13329620	13331620	It's probably true, right?
13331620	13333620	But it's not explaining it.
13333620	13338620	It seems like the magical transition for me is the ability to conceptualize.
13338620	13341620	And I think that's at the heart of defining intelligence as well.
13341620	13348620	The ability to pick out relationships in the world and then pick out relationships between the relationships
13348620	13353620	and then orient your being towards whatever you want within that set of confines.
13353620	13356620	Can you define this for me, what it means to conceptualize?
13356620	13357620	Absolutely.
13357620	13363620	So fundamentally, a concept is a relationship between two physical bodies.
13363620	13366620	So one is moving towards the other, let's say.
13366620	13371620	And then an abstract concept would be taking that motion and relating it to another concept.
13371620	13374620	And you can compound these into greater and greater degrees of abstraction
13374620	13378620	where you're talking about how to play the stock market or something like that at some point,
13378620	13384620	which is a highly abstract, or how to do quantum physics, which is a highly abstract series of concepts.
13384620	13390620	But this ability to conceptualize seems to be wholly unique to the biological domain.
13390620	13394620	As in, I've never seen a computer conceptualize anything before.
13394620	13399620	A visual model is conceptualizing things, or a vision model is also conceptualizing things.
13399620	13404620	It's not difficult to build a system that creates a model of relationship between physical objects
13404620	13409620	and makes abstractions over them, puts them into some kind of embedding space.
13409620	13411620	But can it make a new relationship?
13411620	13413620	I've never seen a computer make a new relationship.
13413620	13418620	It's never come to me and said, hey, this data set that I'm studying,
13418620	13423620	I think there's something happening over here which is interesting and could explain something to us.
13423620	13427620	They're not capable of giving that new order of conceptualization.
13427620	13431620	They don't put relationships together and give you a new relationship.
13431620	13434620	Beyond the bounds of their programming is I think what you're trying to say.
13434620	13435620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
13435620	13437620	So it means you have never tried chat GPT?
13437620	13443620	No, I have, but chat GPT has never ever come up with its own idea for me.
13443620	13449620	It just takes my idea, my conceptualization, and elaborates, embellishes, gives me aid with it.
13449620	13452620	Same with mid-journey. It's not going to solve my problem for me.
13452620	13457620	I have to conceptualize how to trick mid-journey into making the image that I have in my mind.
13457620	13461620	But I had it in my mind to begin with, and I've never seen a computer have something in its mind to begin with.
13461620	13465620	I think that a great illustration of this point is if you go to mid-journey
13465620	13474620	and you're like, make me a YouTube thumbnail for a video about this, it can't really do it.
13474620	13480620	And maybe you can say that given enough time and enough training data
13480620	13486620	that it would understand a YouTube thumbnail well enough to be able to approximate something
13486620	13493620	that is the right amount of tasty that will perform well on YouTube.
13493620	13496620	But it's not quite there yet.
13496620	13502620	And I think that when it does get there, the only thing that it would be able to do
13502620	13513620	is it would be able to make a YouTube thumbnail that maximized the performance of something
13513620	13520620	that had already been done, but it's unlikely that it would create a new genre of YouTube thumbnail.
13520620	13522620	Because there's genres for these things, right?
13522620	13527620	Like there's ideas that people have where it's like, okay, you have to have a face that's looking a certain way,
13527620	13530620	and then you have to have some splashy text that looks this way,
13530620	13535620	and this is a format that works and people use it, but somebody invented that format at some point.
13535620	13538620	And so does the machine invent the format?
13538620	13544620	Or can it only take the existing format and just kind of roughly map your instructions
13544620	13549620	onto something that it has been as a successful YouTube thumbnail and give you that?
13549620	13552620	Yeah, it's our ability to instruct ourselves, which is wholly unique,
13552620	13555620	and I don't see any hint of that in the artificial.
13555620	13559620	I think the word intelligence is completely inappropriate to describe these machines
13559620	13563620	because they don't have that ability to de novo generate concepts.
13566620	13569620	Can you create a concept de novo, please?
13569620	13570620	Absolutely, yeah.
13570620	13572620	But go ahead, tell me something I haven't heard yet.
13572620	13577620	I mean, every time that I write a piece of music, I'm stitching together all sorts of new concepts.
13577620	13580620	I'm going to use this synthesizer in a way I've never used it before
13580620	13586620	to accomplish some goal that I couldn't have imagined before I set this harmonic progression in front of myself.
13586620	13589620	I have the same impression when I use Image Generator.
13589620	13596620	After Delhi came out, I got access and I spent several days producing hundreds of illustrations
13596620	13599620	for the book of imaginary beings by both.
13599620	13604620	And I found that it had profound difficulties when it came to chimeras,
13604620	13608620	which means it takes a long time, many attempts to get a working chimera.
13608620	13614620	And it has to do with the particular kind of mechanism it uses for producing images.
13614620	13621620	So when you are producing something like a minotaur, or a centaur is a better example even,
13621620	13625620	the issue with centaur, it should have seen a bunch of centaurs.
13625620	13631620	And sometimes it gets a centaur, right, like every once in 500 attempts to get a working centaur.
13631620	13636620	But mostly it produces parts of horses and humans early on,
13636620	13641620	and then converges of human and horse in some configuration.
13641620	13646620	Because it doesn't really know how to grow humans and horses together in most of its default training sets.
13646620	13651620	So it's very hard for it to end up in this local optimum where you end up as a centaur.
13651620	13655620	But it has to do with the particular kind of annealing process that is being used.
13655620	13660620	And there are probably better alternatives to this, or you can overcome this with better training,
13660620	13665620	or with some iterative process that produces it that you can also build into the model.
13665620	13669620	There are other issues that it had, the Delhi version that I've been working with was very bad at counting.
13670620	13677620	So if you want to make a dragon with nine heads, it is really very difficult to get something that comes close.
13677620	13684620	It is able to count until 2 plus minus 1, or sometimes 3, but then it gets very difficult.
13684620	13689620	And these models have gotten better when you now generate pictures with mid-journey.
13689620	13693620	Very often the number of fingers is correct. Hands are still somewhat difficult.
13694620	13695620	I'm really glad they fixed that.
13695620	13701620	A joke when some bot is talking to me in my Twitter DMs or on WhatsApp,
13701620	13706620	I ask them to send a picture out of their pretty Japanese face, but of their hands.
13706620	13708620	And they typically don't.
13713620	13719620	It's in some sense very wild what is happening, but there are new genres emerging after mid-journey came out.
13719620	13724620	Like the genre of Kermit the Frog in Space Odyssey and other movies.
13724620	13727620	That was for a shorter time a small genre that popped up.
13727620	13738620	And now you have the Balenciaga genre on YouTube, and everything as well as the Wes Anderson movie genre on YouTube.
13738620	13746620	And of course it gets old fast, but there is something deeper going on with generative AI due to the temporal instability.
13747620	13753620	This stuff has not been trained on video so far, none of the released models, but on individual frames.
13753620	13758620	And as a result, it's hard to make them temporary stable, which means that if you try to create a movie, they often flicker.
13758620	13764620	And every frame is slightly different from a slightly different movie still.
13764620	13771620	And this creates something new. It creates a new form of art in which you realize the efforality of the form.
13771620	13775620	And what's stable is the concept that is referred to by the prompt.
13775620	13783620	We now have an art where the concept itself becomes visible behind the form, because the form is flickering and changing in every frame.
13783620	13786620	That's quite fascinating. It didn't exist before.
13786620	13791620	And if you wanted to produce it, it was very difficult and expensive to make, and now it falls out for free.
13791620	13794620	So there is a new type of art that is possible.
13794620	13799620	I also noticed very simple things when you asked Dali to produce an ultrasound of a dragon egg.
13799620	13803620	It was not in its training data, and it makes a pretty good job.
13803620	13811620	There is something that does require a certain degree of creativity in humans to put all these latent dimensions together.
13811620	13818620	Why does this work? I think it works because if you have enough dimensions, and if you cover the space of these latent dimensions of meaning,
13818620	13823620	extrapolation and interpolation are the same thing.
13823620	13832620	Which means that when we represent meaning, the entire space of meanings can be understood as a high dimensional space
13832620	13840620	in which every dimension is a feature dimension, and every point on this dimension is a state that the feature can be in.
13840620	13848620	And an object is a range in which configurations of features are compatible to produce that object.
13848620	13854620	So you basically get a space of function. Every feature is a function that is varying parameters.
13855620	13863620	Or you could say that a function is a configuration of multiple dimensions if it has multiple parameters that changes that function,
13863620	13865620	and you can create an entire world from this.
13865620	13871620	You could also think about it in a slightly different way when you are creating art with Blender.
13871620	13876620	Blender is a 3D program that allows you to make dynamic scenes and arbitrary objects.
13876620	13883620	And to some degree of approximation, almost everything that you can visually imagine, you can recreate with Blender.
13883620	13891620	And you do this by creating a hierarchical function that starts with a scene, that is the configuration of object that you're looking at.
13891620	13897620	And then you have objects within the scene and overall filters that act on the whole scene and produce certain visual effects.
13897620	13907620	And some of these objects are going to be light sources that can be directed or undirected and have certain features that are discerning the properties of different light sources and define the functional properties.
13908620	13912620	And then you have dynamic objects that are characterized by a skeleton along which movement happens,
13912620	13920620	and joints in these skeletons, and skins that are moving along these joints and on the surface of these skeletons with certain properties,
13920620	13925620	volumes that can be defined in arbitrary ways with mathematical functions and so on.
13925620	13936620	And then textures that are superimposed on these objects, colors that emerge as parts of these textures in interaction with the light sources and reflect the properties of the environment and so on.
13936620	13941620	And so you basically create a complex hierarchical function that is producing all these visual effects.
13941620	13953620	Your mind is probably doing the same. When you are perceiving things, your mind has some kind of game engine that is trained to track perceptual features in your environment.
13953620	13958620	And the present AI systems are doing a relatively good job at doing a similar thing.
13958620	13963620	Arguably, they're not doing this by a self-organization, but by some kind of brute force.
13963620	13967620	But the causal structure of the models that are being generated is pretty similar.
13967620	13973620	And I would lie if I would say that it's not surprising what Dali or Mejwani are generating.
13973620	13976620	Very often they're not generating what I have in mind.
13976620	13983620	But this would also be true if I was an art director and talked to a minion to produce something for me.
13983620	13987620	There are probably many iterations until that gets close to what I have in mind.
13987620	13990620	And this mid-journey, the process is not that different.
13990620	13996620	And so mid-journey in some sense works like an extremely fast, highly skilled, very autistic artist
13996620	14004620	that has seen a lot and is able to combine stuff across many dimensions to produce things that it has never seen and nobody has ever seen.
14004620	14008620	I would say that it lacks understanding, though.
14008620	14014620	It doesn't have the self-organizing. I think that's the hinge. It doesn't have the generative ability to prompt engineer itself.
14014620	14017620	So that is, I think, one prong of this.
14017620	14022620	And the other prong of this is the fact that the things that it generates have no meaning for it.
14022620	14029620	And when you're trying to deal with the question of consciousness and you're like, what is the experience of seeing red?
14029620	14039620	You have to assume that there is a function of red in the evolutionary past that played a role that encodes the way that you perceive it
14039620	14046620	that is the echo of the simpler mind that perceived red for the first time.
14046620	14051620	And is the progenitor of what will come after.
14051620	14059620	I suspect that red by itself doesn't look like anything, in the same way as when you are only looking at the blue sky, you don't see the blueness after a while.
14059620	14065620	Red is a property that is shared by the surfaces of red objects.
14065620	14068620	And it's distinct from the surfaces of blue objects.
14068620	14073620	And the thing that makes it distinct is the relationship that it has to certain objects.
14073620	14078620	It's the color of blood, the color of roses and so on. It's the thing that they have in common.
14078620	14083620	And that's why I also don't think that the inverted spectrum illusion would work,
14083620	14091620	because I don't think that there is any essence of red beyond its relational context of being a surface property of visual objects
14091620	14095620	that share this property across lighting circumstances.
14095620	14102620	So it's basically an invariance in the world in a space of similar invariance that exists in the same function space.
14102620	14111620	And if you transmit this to your model of blender, redness is basically some kind of stationary property of a surface.
14111620	14114620	It cannot be rotated into other colors.
14114620	14120620	In this way, you have a color space that does not really allow you to do the same rotations as you have in a spatial space
14120620	14126620	where you can take an object and rotate it around an angle and it's still somehow the same object.
14126620	14129620	This does not really work with colors.
14129620	14134620	But you can also have a color space in which you have multiple colors which you shift because you change the lighting
14134620	14137620	and thereby perform something similar.
14137620	14140620	So there are certain properties and they're all mathematical properties.
14140620	14149620	And it turns out that basically color is a polar coordinate representation in your brain with respect to certain relational properties.
14149620	14158620	And that's why you can also have synesthesia about color because you can use the same mathematical construct to represent aspects of sound or numbers.
14158620	14161620	And if you do this, you can experience them as colors in your mind.
14161620	14166620	And so functionally, colors are a particular kind of mathematical object.
14166620	14169620	And that still doesn't explain why you experience them.
14169620	14172620	But you've experienced them all along the line, right?
14172620	14178620	Like if you are the end result of 3.8 billion years of evolution, you've probably seen red before.
14178620	14180620	You've probably experienced them because they're useful, right?
14180620	14184620	Humans have an extraordinary capacity to distinguish colors compared to other animals.
14184620	14188620	But this does not explain how it technically works, right?
14188620	14193620	The fact that something is useful doesn't explain how it's actually possible.
14193620	14199620	The fact that it's useful for birds to fly does not by itself explain how it's possible for birds to fly.
14199620	14203620	Well, there's a neuro-mechanical explanation for the perception of color, right?
14203620	14210620	I mean, you have photoreceptors in your eyes that transduce different energies depending on the stimulation they receive.
14210620	14215620	And there's a way of integrating all of that signal in the visual cortex and so on and so forth.
14215620	14218620	Yeah, but you only understand it if you can rebuild it.
14218620	14225620	So, for instance, what I noticed when we built soccer-playing robots and we characterized colors as wavelengths, it didn't really work.
14225620	14230620	For instance, there's reflection of the orange ball in the green field.
14230620	14238620	And we used very intense primary colors to make the task of color segmentation as easy as possible under very even controlled lighting.
14238620	14245620	And it didn't really work even under very even controlled lighting because color is not really a wavelength.
14245620	14248620	It's something that is relative to the objects.
14248620	14259620	We found that the green field below the ball is more orange than the orange ball above the green field due to the mutual reflection is not green.
14259620	14267620	And in order to interpret them properly, we would have to become much more lenient and accommodate the fact that these reflections are happening.
14268620	14280620	And so in some sense, orange is what a boat can get away with being when it's an orange ball under the circumstances that it's in its environment, which are variances in lighting and green objects nearby and so on.
14280620	14296620	Well, I think that actually strikes at the heart of something really important, which is that the human perceptual framework, the consciousness, is able to differentiate between useful information and not useful information.
14296620	14302620	And that's something that you get in when you're using these mid journey prompts where it has a really hard time.
14302620	14309620	You can give it weights and you can kind of you can you can control how it gives importance to various things.
14309620	14312620	But it's really hard to tune meaning into it.
14312620	14320620	Like when you're talking about the fact that it doesn't know how to make a centaur, it's because it doesn't understand anatomy and it doesn't understand what an animal body is and what a human body is.
14320620	14333620	I was really struck by its inability to make hands because to me it was a reflection of the fact that it was a machine that didn't understand what it would be like to pick something up and the biomechanics of what of what hands do.
14333620	14336620	You know, humans are also horrible at drawing hands.
14336620	14339620	Again, no number of artists really struggle doing hands.
14339620	14341620	Hands are extremely difficult.
14341620	14344620	That's not a big surprise that the AI struggles with doing hands.
14344620	14347620	And I would say that the AI is bad at anatomy.
14347620	14352620	The mid journey is definitely much better at anatomy than the average human being.
14352620	14357620	I think that it is decent at anatomy that is conventional.
14357620	14367620	So if you are trying to make something that is a human, there's enough pictures of humans in its in its training data set that it can say, OK, this is the shape of a human.
14367620	14370620	I can move that shape because I've seen it enough different shapes.
14371620	14385620	But if you ask it for a really weird perspective or you ask it for something that isn't really represented in its training set, it doesn't have a conceptual model of human that it can then put into that really weird foreshortening or into the really weird contorted position.
14385620	14387620	That's when you start to get monsters.
14387620	14388620	That's what Gary Marcus told me about Dali.
14388620	14393620	Then I created people from all sorts of perspectives and unicorns from all sorts of perspectives.
14393620	14394620	It's not an issue.
14394620	14395620	It's not true.
14395620	14401620	It does understand the three dimensional structure of objects and is usually able to represent them better than most people do.
14401620	14406620	I think it does understand the structure of three dimensional space due to its training data.
14406620	14411620	And that's why you can also take these models and tune them to produce three dimensional objects as an output.
14411620	14419620	This is a conversation that I feel like would be best had with a portal with mid journey in it where we could like try different prompts as we do it.
14419620	14427620	I also don't think that's actually the problem that you're having because the interesting thing is I don't believe that mid journey is experiencing any of that.
14427620	14429620	I would agree.
14429620	14435620	The interesting question is what is missing to make this experience something?
14435620	14439620	The fact that it's coming from somewhere and going somewhere.
14439620	14444620	I don't know how you can dismiss that.
14444620	14446620	That is what life is.
14447620	14448620	And consciousness.
14448620	14449620	Okay.
14449620	14456620	Do we agree, all three of us sitting here, that consciousness is a property of life?
14456620	14457620	No.
14457620	14458620	No.
14458620	14459620	No.
14459620	14462620	What else is conscious?
14462620	14468620	It's the ability of a system to experience itself observing.
14468620	14471620	It's basically an awareness of your own awareness.
14471620	14474620	What else can do that except for life?
14474620	14477620	At the moment, it's only some living systems that can do it.
14477620	14481620	Possibly, but we don't know there's some AI systems.
14481620	14485620	What is the evidence for AI systems being able to do it?
14485620	14490620	That they're able to report about the features of it.
14490620	14494620	After they've been trained on literature that contains stories about AI futures?
14494620	14496620	That is one of the problems.
14496620	14501620	We have difficulty to discern to which degree the AI system is able to do something
14501620	14504620	because it has seen this in the text.
14504620	14511620	On the other hand, it's hard to say how that is different from the causal structure that is being implemented.
14511620	14515620	If you think, for instance, reasoning, can an AI system reason?
14515620	14518620	It's somewhat related to the question, can a person reason?
14518620	14520620	Can a human being reason?
14520620	14523620	We have an intuition about how reasoning works.
14523620	14526620	This intuition is not completely nonsensical.
14526620	14528620	It's also not perfect.
14528620	14532620	Aristotle tries to systematize it and really writes it all down.
14532620	14534620	He gets only 80% correct.
14534620	14538620	He tries to systematize over pseudoscience and how to do reasoning properly.
14538620	14544620	Then later on, there are people like Tarski and Frege and so on who really reason about reasoning
14544620	14547620	and come up with a formal theory of reasoning that is way better.
14547620	14550620	The people that are reasoning professionally today for a living,
14550620	14554620	they basically read stuff that is derived from this.
14554620	14559620	It's not derived by them just sitting there and thinking about how their own reasoning works
14559620	14561620	and figuring it out magically.
14561620	14564620	In some sense, people to some degree are language models
14564620	14567620	that build causal structure influenced by text that they read
14567620	14572620	and trying to map this causal structure onto other texts that they've read until it clicks.
14572620	14579620	I would agree with that because I always think about the Romanian orphanage example
14579620	14585620	where if you have children that are completely abandoned by the society,
14585620	14588620	they don't grow up normal.
14588620	14595620	There's something about the system that needs both touch and emotional connection
14595620	14603620	and intellectual stimulation in order to form what we define as being a person that fits into society.
14603620	14606620	I still think that they're probably conscious.
14606620	14612620	They're just not able to make the same sort of cognitive leaps and developments.
14612620	14615620	I'm also convinced that cats are conscious.
14615620	14620620	It's something that you can in some sense verify by going into some kind of feedback loop with the cat.
14620620	14626620	You basically have a mutual awareness of the awareness of the other.
14626620	14631620	Doesn't that obviate the example of the philosophical zombie?
14631620	14636620	Sometimes you can just go into a loop with the zombie to confirm the fact that they are having experience
14636620	14641620	even if you can't cut them open to see that they have a brain or put a machine on them.
14641620	14646620	This points to a very interesting aspect of the discussion about the heart problem.
14646620	14649620	It's essentialism versus functionalism.
14649620	14654620	Essentialism is the position that something is just intrinsically in a particular way
14654620	14658620	without realizing some kind of function.
14658620	14665620	A lot of philosophers who feel that consciousness cannot be explained as the result of some kind of causal interaction
14665620	14673620	of non-conscious physical phenomena, they suspect that consciousness needs to be made fundamental.
14673620	14679620	If consciousness is a fundamental property of matter, then you end up with a version of panpsychism.
14679620	14683620	The drawback of panpsychism is that it does not explain how consciousness comes about
14683620	14687620	because it's an answer of the fact that you cannot explain it and thereby say it's irreducible.
14687620	14690620	It's just an essential property of something.
14690620	14696620	When you say that consciousness is a property of biology, it sounds a little bit like this to me.
14696620	14701620	I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but it could be that you are stating that it's an essential property
14701620	14707620	that is just emerging in biological systems as a result of them being biological systems.
14707620	14715620	In order to be a cell that survives, you have to have a way of integrating information
14715620	14722620	about your environment relative to your internal state in such a way that you can bring the two into alignment.
14722620	14728620	You can call it a thermostat, but I think that that's probably a dismissive way of treating it
14728620	14732620	because it's the world's most complicated thermostat.
14732620	14735620	You're right that if you put it into the wrong conditions, it will die,
14735620	14741620	but it's also a thermostat that if the conditions change slowly enough, it will adapt to the new conditions.
14742620	14747620	It will become not a thermostat purely, it will become a thermostat and something else.
14747620	14749620	A thermostat can't do that.
14749620	14758620	There is a structural mechanical event that happens in the bacteria
14758620	14766620	that is the absolute simplest form of what we ascribe as being consciousness.
14766620	14769620	Our consciousness is not the consciousness of bacteria.
14769620	14773620	I don't think that rocks are conscious, I don't think that atoms are conscious,
14773620	14778620	but I do think that by the time that you get to a cell, there is this goal directedness
14778620	14786620	where there is a future that you are working towards and that simplest future for bacteria is I want to survive.
14786620	14790620	It's not written out in natural language of I want to survive,
14790620	14795620	it's programmed to survive and then to turn into something that will survive when the situation changes.
14796620	14800620	When you have a long enough chain of those situations changing,
14800620	14806620	you have organisms that emerge that are able to specialize to different conditions.
14806620	14813620	As you change your organization and make it more complex so that you're able to look at stuff from more perspectives at once,
14813620	14817620	you start to build progressively more complicated systems
14817620	14821620	and those more complicated systems have more complex consciousness.
14821620	14825620	At some point you get to the realization that,
14825620	14833620	oh, hold on a second, there's me and I am a stable self and I can change who I am.
14833620	14840620	That's a crazy step, but I don't think that it's a step that's magical.
14840620	14845620	I think that it's a step that is the result of progressively more and more complex modules
14845620	14850620	that are able to perform the computational task of holding all of these concepts
14850620	14857620	in a stable state relative to one another for long enough for you to be able to look at them and consider them
14857620	14862620	and then after you've considered them to decide what you want to do next.
14863620	14866620	The bacteria might not be able to change itself,
14866620	14871620	but it might be able to move a piece of dirt out of the way to get somewhere that it wants to get to.
14871620	14875620	It's not conscious. That's something that the soccer-playing robot can also do
14875620	14879620	that they don't want to ascribe consciousness to without being forced to.
14879620	14886620	I feel that you are much more reluctant to ascribe consciousness to the soccer-playing robot than you are to the cell,
14886620	14890620	despite the cell probably being dumber than the soccer-playing robot.
14890620	14893620	It's the evolution that's important.
14893620	14901620	I don't see how the process that generates a certain thing is defining its functional properties qualitatively.
14901620	14907620	If you are evolving the soccer-playing robot and it's the same soccer-playing robot, it doesn't change anything.
14907620	14913620	It only matters what it is embodying at this time when you look at it.
14913620	14920620	I think that's not how I see consciousness, because I see consciousness as something that is across time.
14920620	14929620	It could also be that your issue with the communication about the heart problem is that you have a non-standard definition of consciousness
14929620	14932620	that is meaning something completely different.
14933620	14937620	For most people that talk about consciousness, it's about the feeling of what it's like.
14937620	14943620	This feeling of what it's like, there are some philosophers which believe that it comes in degrees.
14943620	14946620	There are certain ways in which you can have a feeling of what it's like.
14946620	14950620	They're qualitatively different from each other, and maybe there are some degrees.
14950620	14957620	But you could also say that it has a continuous way in which you can become more or less conscious.
14957620	14962620	But I'm not in the camp that thinks that this is the right interpretation.
14962620	14965620	I think that consciousness is qualitative.
14965620	14970620	I think that there is basically a disruption between conscious and not conscious,
14970620	14975620	and there is some area in between where it becomes online and very only approximately conscious.
14975620	14981620	But there are no systems that are persistently in a state of only being approximately vaguely conscious.
14981620	14988620	It's only during this transition that there is some kind of coherence formation that happens between sleeping and waking,
14988620	14993620	or waking up into a dream vis-en-sleep or out of a dream.
14993620	15000620	This movement inside of a conscious state or outside of a conscious state is a qualitative difference.
15000620	15007620	The criterion between them is that outside of a conscious state there is no feeling of what it's like.
15008620	15015620	If you fall unconscious because maybe you faint, in this state you don't know what it's like to have fainted.
15015620	15017620	You wake up and you don't realize what happened.
15017620	15024620	You have no memory trace of that state, and there's probably nothing that your mind went to in the meantime.
15024620	15028620	It was conscious about something else and just did not bring the memory along.
15028620	15032620	You were just not conscious for all practical means and purposes.
15033620	15038620	I think that consciousness is a qualitative property that is not like fatness.
15038620	15044620	You could say that fatness is something that's very gradual, and you could also say that bacteria can sometimes be fat,
15044620	15047620	but if they're fat, they're fat in a very different way than humans are.
15047620	15051620	In a sense it makes sense, but I don't think that consciousness is like fatness.
15051620	15056620	I don't think that bacteria are conscious. It's possible and conceivable that they are,
15056620	15063620	but it would require that they have a very particular functional mechanism that would enable the bacterium to feel what it's like.
15063620	15067620	And if the bacterium doesn't have that, I would say it's not conscious.
15067620	15072620	It's just the way in which I would use the word. Can we agree on this usage of the word?
15073620	15082620	I think that the fundamental difference between the robot and the real soccer player is that the real soccer player could decide to just quit and do MMA instead.
15083620	15086620	You can build a robot like that. That's not the big problem.
15086620	15093620	That decides to take on a completely different task, but by its own it just decides that?
15093620	15096620	Yes. You give it a larger reward function.
15096620	15100620	You give it some kind of polythematic reward function in a similar way as we do.
15100620	15102620	But you have to do that.
15102620	15106620	Yes, but we can give it this. You are born with this reward function to a large degree.
15106620	15109620	Some part of it comes online during later stages in your life,
15109620	15113620	but for the most part your reward function is built into you by your organism.
15113620	15119620	So your mind is subject to some functions that are imposed on it by the organism,
15119620	15127620	and your personal self is subject to the expression of these motivational urges by your outside mind that makes you do stuff.
15127620	15136620	And the way this is functionally implemented or the way in which you can abstract it is that there is some kind of multidimensional reward function
15136620	15142620	that tells you in a given situation, in a given context, this is the value of a kiss, this is the value of a sandwich,
15142620	15145620	this is the value of getting the ball and the goal.
15145620	15151620	And if that changes, you might give up the plan on getting the ball into the goal and choose a completely different game to play,
15151620	15155620	because you feel that this other game is giving you better rewards,
15155620	15159620	which does require you to be able to have a meta game that you are playing.
15159620	15165620	So if you have a soccer-playing robot that only is playing the single game and cannot conceptualize anything outside of it,
15165620	15168620	then of course it will not be able to make that decision.
15168620	15178620	But if the robot is thinking of itself as an agent that can play soccer or look for a sandwich or look for a kiss, as you might,
15178620	15184620	then you have a much larger area in which you are going to optimize your expected rewards.
15184620	15188620	But it's not a soccer-playing robot anymore, it's a human being essentially.
15188620	15193620	You've just rebuilt life at that point.
15193620	15196620	But we are not necessarily at consciousness yet.
15196620	15201620	So what I described, this functionality is still a robot that is just playing a different game.
15201620	15208620	But we have not arrived yet at a system, despite producing all sorts of functionality that you would only expect a human to be capable of.
15208620	15216620	And you can even conceive of a system that is able to produce coherent sentences and interact with you in all sorts of ways without being conscious.
15216620	15219620	So there is this big question for a lot of people,
15219620	15230620	what is the difference between this universal robot that is pursuing the same goals as a human being and that has the same degrees of flexibility as a human being and pursuing them
15230620	15241620	and can make decisions over them in a functional way in the sense that it commits to different goals at different times based on reasons that are built into neural networks and reasoning mechanisms
15241620	15249620	that it's able to report and self-report about all these things, and yet there is nothing what it's like to be that robot.
15249620	15252620	This is the hard problem. What is that difference?
15252620	15259620	But if it has the ability to integrate all of these motivations, isn't that what experience is ultimately?
15259620	15260620	No.
15260620	15262620	Yeah, like why are you so sure that it's not conscious at that point?
15262620	15268620	Because I think there is no reason for that system to say, but I feel this.
15268620	15277620	Isn't the desire, isn't that decision to go and do MMA instead of soccer predicated on feelings?
15277620	15288620	No, you could simply say there is a 0.2 higher utility in making a sandwich rather than continuing to play soccer. So I'm going to do that.
15288620	15296620	But it might not be higher utility. It might actually be a terrible idea to go and do MMA if you're the best soccer player in the world, but you just want to do it because you love MMA.
15296620	15304620	Oh, that's a great point. Humans don't perform along these sorts of utility functions.
15304620	15309620	Somebody can do something that doesn't maximize utility. They do it all the time.
15309620	15320620	I think that is a complicated philosophical decision because there is usually a reason that you find something more meaningful and important to do something when you do it.
15320620	15330620	Or it's a compulsion, which means you realize you have a long game, but you are unable to play it because some mechanism in your brain is overriding it and you're forced to follow an impulse to play a shorter game.
15330620	15339620	But when you find something meaningful, it means that you can also describe it or somebody could describe it as a utility function.
15339620	15349620	So, for instance, if your meaning is to serve God, it means that you are projecting some higher level agent that you're part of in a similar way as a cell as part of an organism.
15349620	15362620	And you're serving that transcendental agency. And that creates meaning that is more important than your individual existence because you don't conceptualize yourself as the top root note of the universe, but just as a cell that is serving some larger organism.
15362620	15369620	And you can try to figure out the relevance of that with respect to getting a sandwich instead.
15369620	15375620	And suddenly getting the sandwich is instrumental to serving this higher meaning to some degree.
15375620	15388620	I think that we've kind of stumbled onto something important here, which is that the complexity of the utility function and the ability to have multiple competing short term and long term goals.
15388620	15404620	And this freedom of space in which to decide the way in which you will chain those actions together in order to achieve a goal that you have decided is utilitarian is the thing that you would then probably call consciousness.
15404620	15412620	And so the reason that the robot isn't conscious is because the robot has such a narrow scope of options available to it that it's too simple.
15412620	15418620	The minute that you know it is consciousness is the feeling of what it's like. This is what you need to produce.
15418620	15422620	So what is the feeling complexity is not producing a feeling.
15422620	15433620	But hold on. So if you're saying that everything that a human does can be reduced to a utility function, if you have a sufficiently complex understanding of their internal landscape,
15433620	15440620	then what feelings are is they are the experience of the utility function.
15440620	15446620	The utility function causes some kind of chemical change inside of you that can be modulated either with neurotransmitters.
15446620	15450620	It can be modulated with the potassium sodium balance at the membranes.
15450620	15455620	It can be modulated by the harmonics of your brain waves.
15455620	15464620	And when you're doing that thing, you have this full body electrochemical state that is the experience.
15464620	15468620	It is the experience lives inside of the body.
15468620	15477620	And so your feeling of a decision that you make is the result of everything that happens inside of your body as you are making the decision.
15477620	15486620	That's what feeling is. It's the sum total of the whole electrochemical state of the entire body as it does something.
15486620	15489620	With respect to the rest of the universe.
15489620	15491620	I would.
15491620	15501620	It's very poetic, but it's not convincing to me because it's still just clockwork and would not explain why there is an agent that experiences itself experiencing something.
15501620	15508620	Well, because the agent has to be the agent has to be able to say, I'm experiencing this and this is good.
15508620	15515620	And I will keep experiencing it because the agent's job is to make sure that the internal state is such that it can reproduce.
15515620	15522620	That's the agent's job. The agent's job is that life is a state of matter that aims towards complexity.
15522620	15530620	And your job as the agent is to make sure that this crystalline structure of life survives for long enough to make more of itself.
15530620	15534620	And if you fuck that up by feeling bad all the time, you're not going to make that goal.
15534620	15537620	And if you don't make that goal, you have failed at your mission.
15537620	15545620	And so the feeling is the agent who's responsible for enacting the goal, checking in to be like, Hey, are we on the right track?
15545620	15554620	Don't buy the idea that your uncertainty about whether you're going to reproduce is reflecting uncertainty about whether you're conscious or not.
15554620	15556620	Hold on. Say it again.
15556620	15559620	You just connected it to reproduction.
15559620	15566620	And at the beginning of our conversation, you did mention uncertainty about whether you intend to reproduce.
15566620	15570620	This does not reflect uncertainty about your consciousness, right?
15570620	15573620	Your consciousness is completely uncorrelated to this.
15573620	15578620	No, but your feelings are correlated to some of them.
15578620	15581620	Some of them are, but not the ability to feel it itself.
15581620	15593620	The ability to feel itself has to be the result of some causal process that a lot of people find confusing to get at because it is not apparent how a physical system would feel.
15593620	15598620	It seems to me that feeling is a property that you can only dream.
15598620	15603620	And what we have to explain is how a physical system is able to produce dreams.
15604620	15615620	I think that the question of how a physical system can produce dreams is a really interesting question, but it might be a good place for us to pause because we've been going.
15615620	15625620	I also think that it's worth it's interesting that if we can't explain how humans are able to produce feelings, then we can't rule out the fact that bacteria produce feelings as well.
15625620	15627620	But this is not the point.
15627620	15636620	I think we can explain how humans produce feelings by coming up with an explanation that would produce a causal agent that is reporting feelings.
15636620	15643620	The fact that bacteria do not report feelings is a possible indication that they don't have any.
15643620	15650620	The fact that people report feelings produces this burden of explanation of this phenomenon.
15650620	15657620	To simply say that both people and bacteria are alive and therefore both have feelings is somewhat unsatisfactory.
15657620	15664620	I don't think that bacteria have the same feelings as humans.
15664620	15667620	I think it's just really healthy to leave it in the hypothetical realm.
15667620	15671620	You said something earlier where you just were like, well, it's possible or something like that.
15671620	15677620	And I think that's often the best place we can get with our theoretical understanding of nature is whether something is possible.
15678620	15687620	I have a suspicion that what is going on is some distinction about the kind of nature of the universe that we are in.
15687620	15698620	When I was a kid, I read books about physics and our normal post-enlightenment modernist way of understanding our own place in the universe.
15698620	15704620	And I read Klawatsky and Aveda and other books.
15704620	15713620	And I realized that there seem to be two fundamentally different conceptions about the nature of the reality that we find ourselves being thrown in.
15713620	15720620	And one is that we are basically in a machine and we are part of the machine and it is nothing that is not part of the machine.
15720620	15730620	And that's basically the physicalist idea that there is a costly, closed, lowest layer that is entirely mechanical over which everything else emerges without any magic ever happening.
15730620	15734620	And in this world, it's pretty hard to explain miracles.
15734620	15739620	And the existence of our consciousness seems to be somewhat close to a miracle.
15739620	15749620	And if we would perceive magical stuff, like if you're able to burn a black cat and as a result we perceive a new kind of celestial event,
15749620	15759620	this kind of symbolic interaction would also what classifies as a miracle because it cannot easily be explained by some causal interaction on them,
15759620	15763620	some causally closed lowest layer that doesn't care about symbols.
15763620	15774620	And the other explanation that we could be in, that the one that is implied by Castaneda's worldview and so on, is that we are living in a dream.
15774620	15784620	That magic is possible and that the reason why miracles are so rare is the result of the way in which we are dreaming the dream.
15784620	15793620	So all the causal structure that seems to be so regular, the regularity of physics and so on in this worldview is explained by features in which the dream is happening.
15793620	15803620	And later on, as I try to think about these worldviews and make a distinction about them, I did notice that indeed I am living clearly in a dream.
15803620	15809620	There's lots of evidence that I'm living in a dream because the features of my dream are malleable.
15810620	15815620	It's very much like a lucid dream at night. I can change the way that a face looks like to me.
15815620	15823620	I can change my memories over the past. I can change my identity. I can change aspects of my consciousness in a pretty fundamental sense.
15823620	15834620	So I am clearly living in a dream. But the regularity in the dream can be explained by there being a parent universe in which there is some kind of machinery that is producing the dream.
15835620	15842620	And the machinery that is producing the dream is the brain of a primate in a physical universe.
15842620	15849620	And in this way, I can fit it all together and I can explain consciousness as a dream property that cannot be explained physically.
15849620	15854620	Like neurons cannot experience anything. Consciousness only exists as if.
15854620	15860620	Neurons can do stuff as if. They can produce representations that only exist as if.
15860620	15868620	In the same way as stuff in a computer game is only as if. It's virtual. It's only existing as a projection.
15868620	15876620	And I think that consciousness is a projection. It's a representational property of a system that is aware of the fact that it's aware.
15876620	15880620	And this is crucial thing about it that has to do with this hard problem.
15880620	15884620	And it is not readily apparent when you think what you see is physics in the physical universe.
15884620	15893620	And it could be that you don't perceive this as so much as a problem because you have committed yourself relatively early to the insight that you're living in some kind of dream.
15893620	15901620	And in this dream, you can dream about vibrations that produce phenomena in biological systems and that are intrinsically related to consciousness.
15901620	15911620	You experience yourself in this dream. You experience that everything is consciousness in the world. Everything that you touch is representational.
15912620	15917620	And I think that's true because we actually are living in that dream.
15917620	15925620	And physics is really talking about another universe that we can never touch, that can only be described as mathematics.
15925620	15933620	And my task is to explain stuff in this outside reality that we can never touch, that we can never be in using mathematical languages.
15934620	15940620	I think that you have struck at the heart of our disagreement then.
15940620	15947620	Because I do think that there is a very different perspective that we're coming at.
15947620	15949620	Do you want to elaborate?
15949620	15954620	No, go ahead. I mean, you're just saying I don't think we agree about what physics is fundamentally.
15955620	15962620	Shiloh has expressed that after several hours, he started meeting at 11. Now it's a quarter to four.
15962620	15967620	He is getting a little bit exhausted, which I think is very human and understandable.
15970620	15973620	It is hard to sit in a chair for three or four hours.
15973620	15983620	But I just think that fundamentally we're approaching physics as a material science, not as a mathematical science, which starts with bodies interacting with one another.
15983620	15990620	And you can treat this landscape of bodies interacting as a territory and you can make mathematical maps for it.
15990620	15995620	But ultimately, a body is a surface-bound volume that has inward extension.
15995620	16000620	But you know that physics, the surface-bound volumes are emergent over stuff that is more simple.
16000620	16009620	And ultimately, physics is about information that you can conceptualize as existing in different locations and moving in certain trajectories.
16009620	16019620	Yes, but biology is a subset of physics. It's a subset of physics that describes the dynamics of cells, which are complicated arrangements of molecular machinery.
16019620	16023620	There exist many levels above the course of the lowest level of physics.
16023620	16034620	There exist certain levels of coarse graining where you already are assuming that particles exist and particles form molecules in some way and the molecules are forming cellular machinery.
16034620	16037620	But I would never assume that particles exist, right?
16037620	16042620	I mean, a particle is just an instantiation of some measurement or predicted measurement.
16042620	16047620	It's a dynamic factor. A particle is not a static body that has an architecture to it, right?
16047620	16051620	Only bodies that have locations can exist.
16051620	16057620	You can imagine all sorts of bodies like your cenotaur that doesn't exist. It has no location in the universe.
16057620	16061620	You don't live in a universe that actually has localization in space.
16061620	16065620	Localization is something that emerges to some degree of approximation in our universe.
16065620	16068620	Well, localization is just your distance to the other objects.
16068620	16071620	It's just the distance to all of them.
16071620	16073620	There is no distance.
16073620	16076620	What do you mean if two bodies are touching one another?
16076620	16082620	If you basically zoom in very hard, what you notice is that you only have a quantum universe.
16082620	16087620	Well, that's a mathematical description. Once again, that's not actually what's physically meaningful.
16087620	16089620	Exactly. It's the lowest level of physics.
16089620	16094620	No, it's the lowest level at which we've been able to conceptualize it is that we're using mathematics to describe it.
16094620	16098620	I don't mean that because I can mathematically describe the table that it's made out of math.
16098620	16100620	It's just that the table can be described by math.
16100620	16105620	The atoms have architecture which allows them to do all of their incredible properties, right?
16105620	16109620	Their architecture fundamentally is what allows them to do light and gravity.
16109620	16117620	We don't have a good model in the mainstream for how those atoms' architectures provide for those mysterious phenomena.
16117620	16121620	We just describe them with math and move on because it allows us to build technology.
16121620	16127620	Your tables are real, but quantum effects are not real.
16127620	16135620	I didn't say real. I just said it's really, really important to frame the definition of existence in physics,
16135620	16139620	where physics starts with bodies that exist. They have to exist.
16139620	16145620	They have to have that architecture and it has to have a location with respect to the other bodies in the presentation.
16145620	16147620	That's not quite true.
16147620	16153620	I think that there are levels in foundational physics where you don't have bodies which are surface-constrained volumes.
16153620	16156620	Not everything has a location.
16156620	16161620	This is a mistake, though. This is a mistake because then you're talking about unicorns and things that don't exist,
16161620	16165620	even though you can conceptualize them. They don't necessarily pertain to the physical world.
16165620	16167620	You're talking about something that is more basic than your bodies.
16167620	16171620	You're talking about something that gives rise to bodies, that is more fundamental than bodies.
16171620	16174620	But bodies are fundamental to physics, is my point.
16174620	16177620	You can't do physics. You're not talking about physics.
16177620	16179620	My point is that your point is wrong.
16179620	16181620	Then how do you define physics, I guess?
16181620	16184620	Basically, go to a foundational physics conference and not talking about bodies there.
16184620	16188620	That's a problem. That's a really big problem. They were before 150 years ago.
16188620	16190620	They were absolutely only talking about bodies.
16190620	16192620	Progress is a bitch, I understand.
16192620	16197620	It's not necessarily progress, right? It's actually getting us down all of these rabbit holes
16197620	16200620	where we have completely untestable theories that aren't necessarily providing for technology,
16200620	16206620	like string theory, for instance, or our doomsday cosmology,
16206620	16210620	which is predicated on non-physical situations that emerge from the mathematics
16210620	16214620	but don't have any empirical evidence on earth whatsoever.
16214620	16220620	Okay. I sense that we basically arrived at a point where we will not be able in the next few minutes
16220620	16226620	to achieve consensus. I think that's fine. Let's leave it at that for today.
16226620	16227620	Absolutely.
16227620	16232620	Thank you, Shiloh. Thank you, Anastasia. I really enjoyed our conversation today.
16232620	16234620	Thank you for inviting me on your podcast.
16234620	16238620	I enjoy being with you. I enjoy the perspective that you bring to this
16238620	16242620	and the overall intention that you have behind your exploration.
16242620	16247620	The feeling is mutual. Thank you so much for taking the time and for the ideas
16247620	16254620	and the many, many questions that we will continue exploring after this conversation.
16254620	16258620	It's been stimulating. Thank you. Thank you, Yasha. Take care. Bye-bye.
16258620	16259620	Have a great rest of your day.
