1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,520
So, for me, it was with the Meme that I had this ghostly flash and thought, okay, I notice

2
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,760
that when I look back, I had a certain intellectual development and it's not quite

3
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,240
like it's in the memes, but it's such a thing that I also notice with other people

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,040
when they think about how logic works. And I thought, okay, we could just

5
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,560
express it with this meme as if it were a journey. And of course it's not a

6
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,480
journey, but it's more of a branch out into different branches and then you end up in

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,640
different areas of the meaning space. But for myself, of course, I can

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,880
understand my own path. And this first step is one that I haven't stayed in for a long time.

9
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,440
It's about two and a half thousand years old and goes back to Plato and Aristotle. And these

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,320
three laws of logic or laws of thought are derived from the syllogisms, i.e. from the forms

11
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,360
in which linguistic logic worked, from the point of view of Aristotle, who tried to

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,200
systematize it. And if you look at it from today's point of view, i.e. with the terms of logic

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,400
of Tarski and others, then you have the impression that he was right about 80 percent, which is

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,440
somehow much better than most contemporary philosophers, so not so bad. And the three

15
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,800
rules he describes are on the one hand the law of identity and almost identity so that a thing

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,120
cannot be itself if you do something about it or take it away. And that every thing

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,240
has to be self-identical for all things. This is an action with which you can describe identity.

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,120
And the next thing is that he says that a thing cannot be true and false at the same time.

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,320
So a statement, a statement, a proposition can either be true or false. And the next thing is,

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,920
every statement must be either true or false.

21
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
Then we get problems afterwards.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,320
Yes, exactly. And I also had problems with all of these things, because at first it

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,840
looks like it would work, but I looked at my own thinking and found that

24
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,320
it was not like that in my own thinking. And one thing that I noticed is, for example,

25
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,000
that it starts with identity. When I try to describe things about their identity,

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,240
for example when I write a computer program, then it does not capture how identity really is.

27
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,280
So, for example, when I play a computer game myself, when are two objects in this

28
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,720
computer game identical from the point of view of the player? For example, two trees. I can, for example,

29
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,000
define an object in a computer game in the same way as the tree that I then use several times in the

30
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,160
computer game and put it in there. Is that the same tree or is it another tree if it has different

31
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,960
coordinates? That depends on the context. So I can say that it is the same tree that I

32
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,280
encounter several times or there are different trees that only look the same by chance.

33
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,080
Well, you want a functional description level and on certain selected description levels

34
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,920
it is the same, but it already seems to you that if you keep zooming out in the

35
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,240
description, then at some point it is no longer identical, no matter what you want.

36
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,680
There is also this famous ship of the T-Seus, which is such a philosophical paradox that

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,720
philosophers like to dig up. It is about the T-Seus building a ship and

38
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,640
that at some point it sank in the Mediterranean and it was so salty all around that it

39
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,360
remained relatively well preserved. And the archaeologists then pull it out at some point,

40
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,560
it is of course somehow weathered and they decide to restore it and take the

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,120
individual boards off the ship and replace them with new boards of the same shape and

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,560
color. And gradually the ship is restored and looks the same as before and

43
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,120
next to it is a pile of boards. And that is the same ship as before, just renewed. And now

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,920
someone else comes and takes this pile of boards and builds the original ship

45
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,160
together again. And what is the ship of the T-Seus? Intuitively, it is

46
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,720
not that easy to find out in which branch we are now entering. And what we

47
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,080
find out is that this identity is not at all a natural category, but a

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,240
cognitive category that we apply under certain conditions. And what these

49
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,240
concepts, what these identities are all together is, from my point of view, that we add a world

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:29,520
line to the thing. So we say that this object exists with a series of instances in time and

51
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,040
we therefore bind the instances of this object into one single object. And what is important

52
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,720
is not that it is identical in nature, but only that they share the identity. So this

53
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,440
property of identity and that means in principle have to have a kind of common

54
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,280
biography. And this attribution of the biography, i.e. an imaginary property,

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,120
which objects have together over time or over different observations,

56
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,960
that is the essence of the identity in the way I use it in my head. And this

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,800
equality of property, which I have, for example, in a certain logical system,

58
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,680
that these are two objects that are identical when they share all properties, is a much

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:12,120
narrower form of identity that I can submit to the thing, i.e. to my identity concept,

60
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,360
but only under certain conditions. We see that we can define identity in different ways

61
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,200
and from this we get different mathematical concepts in which identity can exist.

62
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,320
The next thing can be true or false. For example, I could say I have a variable

63
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,440
in a computer program and that is a variable that can contain bulges, i.e. a truth value,

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,320
binaries in this case, which you can have, for example, a logical true or false. And I can

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,000
also define a ternary logic, i.e. which I have true and false and undetermined,

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,960
or a probabilistic logic in which I have 100 percent or zero as true and false and the

67
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,880
things in between are then further logic values. And in our own head we realize

68
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,840
that we can use different such logics and convert between them under certain conditions.

69
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,440
So a logic that is binary and only knows true and false and a logic that is true,

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,440
false and undetermined. And that with the excluded third is even more complicated,

71
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,080
because this logic works what Gödel has found out under certain conditions no longer.

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,560
That is, these original laws of logic do not allow these axioms to be

73
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,280
maintained under all conditions. For example, when I allow infinity,

74
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,360
when I look at many features that lead to contradictions. And that was for Gödel,

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,560
who thought that he could maintain the axioms, a catastrophe. But for a computer scientist

76
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,520
this is not such a big problem, because the computer scientist says, okay,

77
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,600
in this programming language I define my logic and my true and false in a very specific way.

78
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,440
And that leads to the fact that I have the opportunity to calculate what I think in

79
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,560
these and all conditions for true and false. There are still essays in which it is done as

80
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,520
these three laws of thinking are absolutely elementary. And then maybe a fourth,

81
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,920
that it is all basic. So, for example, biological organisms have the ability to

82
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,240
compare things and all this is derived from them. And maybe it's very deep-seated,

83
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,400
but from my point of view it doesn't seem deep-seated. I have the impression that it doesn't

84
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,320
lead very far, I can't build a mind out of it.

85
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:43,800
Logic cannot provide absolute truth, because it is based on unprovable axioms.

86
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Then it's not 2 and 2, 4, but 2 and 2 is 5. So maybe I could take an axiom system

87
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
that works like that. And that's the next step you could take in your thinking,

88
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,120
that you discover that mathematics and logic are in some way popular, that you can simply

89
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,280
derive another logic from it if you use other rules. But that doesn't necessarily

90
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,120
lead far in the end, because most of these logics are not very interesting, in the sense that they

91
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,120
don't lead to interesting structures. Namely, not to structures with which I can describe

92
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,280
any reality or interesting system. And the logics, the interesting

93
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,240
structure forms with which I can describe worlds and arithmetic and so on,

94
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,080
there are relatively few of them.

95
00:09:49,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Level 3. Truth depends on its consistent definition in a formal language. It can be

96
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,320
defined in any way we want.

97
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,640
As far as I understand it, that means that the truth is a predicate that we

98
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:31,560
assign entities in our language. Is that right? What do you think I don't understand then?

99
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
What do you think people should understand in order to reach level 3?

100
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:43,000
There are often discussions at a place where people say define truth. And then you can

101
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,800
refer to Stanford and Cyclopedia on philosophy, or to Wikipedia, or to a number of other websites,

102
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:59,160
or to certain works by logicians, for example Tarski. And what we find is that they had

103
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,480
a few approaches to logic. In philosophy, for example, there are correspondence theories

104
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,880
that say that things become true by referring to facts in the real world. But then the

105
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,800
question arises, what is actually a fact in the real world? Or there are coherence theories

106
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,440
where you say something is true, when all statements that have a claim to truth are

107
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,480
coherent with each other in a system. That means that there are no constraints.

108
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,640
And usually these systems are not very precisely defined. And the really precise

109
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:36,880
definitions usually exist in formal logic. And the main traditions use axioms

110
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,480
that often lead to contradictions, for example, if you look at the Goethe proof,

111
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,080
or Tarski's undefinability theorem, which is related to the Goethe set of incompleteness.

112
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,120
I think I'd rather not go into detail. I think it is more important that we first

113
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,680
become aware of what a language can say about the world. And in this tradition

114
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,160
in which we are right now, it is the case that a language cannot say anything about a world

115
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,360
outside of itself. That is different from natural languages, because the natural

116
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,760
languages ​​that we use to communicate with each other say something about a perceptual

117
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,960
world and about a mentally represented world that is not captured in the natural language at all,

118
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,160
but which can show the natural language. And we share enough of this language of thinking

119
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,400
in which we can depict perceptions, so that it is good enough to show. But in the end,

120
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,840
we cannot prove that we are talking about the same thing if we only show, because we do not know

121
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,200
what the other person is showing. And in formal logic you try to exclude that. And the hope

122
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,040
is that what exists in the perceptual world can be depicted in a logical language. And

123
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,200
it is also necessary that I get the whole world into this logical language. And

124
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,280
what Gödel has found out is that the actions he has taken lead to contradictions. That

125
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,000
means I cannot build a machine in mathematics that allows this specification of the language that

126
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,680
Gödel has used to run without this machine flying around your ears,

127
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,720
so that this computer crashes. And it is because the actions that he has used

128
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,320
to run without this machine that the logic is state-free. This means that the truth exists

129
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,480
regardless of the processing process of a program. So you do not have to be determined step by step

130
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,560
with the algorithm, but in total. This state-freedom of mathematics has a very good

131
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,640
property, which is why the mathematicians who want to have it, they allow me to deal with

132
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,560
infinity. If I have to describe everything step by step, then I know how to do it,

133
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,880
and I can decompose and put it together, i.e. conduct constructive mathematics.

134
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,360
But the disadvantage is that I never get to infinity. I can only add step by step,

135
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,960
but something like pi, for example, i.e. a number with an infinite number of places,

136
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,200
I can never completely describe in this way. And that means I can

137
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,640
create a system that runs continuously and, for example, emits a wave. And the wave

138
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,000
is a periodic process, that is, a circle that is pulled apart over time.

139
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Pi has to be known until the end, so that the wave can run completely when the

140
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,680
world is continuous. And that means if I want to describe such a world in my logic,

141
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,280
then I have to deal with infinity and continuity. And that's all I can do

142
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,160
if I have functions that take up an infinite number of bits at once as an argument,

143
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,080
and then perform operations over this infinite number of bits at once, and in the end

144
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,080
also be able to output an infinite number of bits again. If I want to do this step by step,

145
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,040
it doesn't work. And what Gödel found out is that the assumptions that he had about

146
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,520
truth in this language lead to contradictions. And how did he do that?

147
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,360
He first found out that the language should not refer to the outside world,

148
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,800
but it should build everything in itself. And if the language can only refer to things in itself,

149
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,400
then you can't talk about yourself. And that's a problem. How can I

150
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,800
make the language talk about itself? And the solution is that I have to build the language

151
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,320
in itself. So the language has to be so powerful that it can build itself from scratch and that

152
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
performance can build itself. In order to do that, in order for a language to be executed,

153
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,080
I need a computer, a system that can, so to speak, go from one step to the next

154
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,720
step. When Gödel did that, that was at the beginning of the 30s,

155
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
and he had already started to think about it beforehand, there was no computer yet.

156
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,880
So he looked for one that he could take and he actually discovered one. And those were the

157
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,920
piano axioms. The piano axioms can be derived from all the natural numbers.

158
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,080
And the nice thing is that it's really just a handful of rules with which you can define

159
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,000
how they look. It's basically a kind of number stream that consists of discrete units,

160
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,240
so if one is bigger. And what you need is an operator with which you can practically

161
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,800
take one step forward and backward. And if you use it several times, then you can define the

162
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,080
addition as simply the repeated forward and backward. And the multiplication

163
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,840
can be done by repeated addition. Addition, so to speak, by counting, actually. Yes,

164
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,800
so just counting is basically this teleporting on the number stream. And I can,

165
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,800
by not just taking one step forward and backward, but teleporting. I do that by

166
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,840
defining an operation, a function, that simply consists of the

167
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,640
automating of the forward and backward. And the multiplication is, so to speak,

168
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,640
the automating of the addition, by doing that several times. And the relationship

169
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,320
between the addition and the multiplication is the exponentialization. The cool thing is,

170
00:16:52,400 --> 00:17:01,200
I can define an operation with which I project the two numbers in a room and

171
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,520
perform an addition in the room and then project it back, then with a logarithm,

172
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,360
that's the reverse of the exponentiation, and then it's equivalent. That means,

173
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,080
what it shows is that addition and multiplication are the same if I send them through such a

174
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,120
projection. And this projection is the exponentiation or the logarithm back. And

175
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,640
that means, I can build up the whole math step by step, just by taking these

176
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,600
natural numbers. And the multiplication, so to speak, when the addition is

177
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,160
teleporting, then it's the multiplication of zooming. I can zoom in and zoom out,

178
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,920
and by doing that I can make numbers that are smaller than whole numbers,

179
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,720
rational numbers. And a rational number I can describe as the ratio between

180
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:51,600
two whole numbers. That's a break. And that means, just a few of the whole numbers

181
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,120
results in any rational number. And Pythagoras hoped, that's it now,

182
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,920
more won't come. But then he found out, and the people in his cult, in his

183
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,760
Mathematica Club back then, that there are still irrational numbers. That means,

184
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,400
those that unfortunately cannot be described as such, for example Pi or the root of two.

185
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,600
And that's a terrible result, because it's the idea that you can lead the whole world from the

186
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,680
integers, from the whole numbers, to nothing. And the legend says that this guy,

187
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,560
who secretly betrayed the world, he shouldn't have betrayed it, he let him kill him,

188
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,160
because it was really a secret that the world shouldn't find out. And from my point of view,

189
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:42,400
Pythagoras was right. The world wasn't ready. The thing is, that the mathematicians were confused

190
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
by that, because they thought there are these irrational numbers. And the computer scientists

191
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
later discovered that there are these irrational numbers not as numbers, not as values,

192
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,560
but as functions. That means, I can define such a program that calculates Pi for me,

193
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,080
and this program does that little by little, there are more and more places for me, Pi makes me

194
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,400
more and more precise. But it will never go to the point that it gives me the last place.

195
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,160
And that also means that there can be no computer program from this point of view

196
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,200
that creates a world in which a perfect circle takes place. But the circles that

197
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,200
are described are always rounder, so to speak, but they are never completely round.

198
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,280
And the world in which we are is not necessarily one in which round circles exist,

199
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,000
but it is one in which, in the end, the resolution becomes smaller and smaller,

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,280
but never infinitely small, but at some point the world falls apart in quantum effects.

201
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,280
And it never becomes continuous, but it is always continuous, continuous.

202
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,520
And from this point of view, there is no geometry. The geometry is not a real part of

203
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
mathematics in the calculation, but something that exists only in the scope of approximation.

204
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,480
That is, so to speak, the mathematics of the numbers that are too big to count them.

205
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
And in an area where numbers are too big to count them, that is the world in which we

206
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,040
are in general, where too many molecules are there to observe them individually,

207
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,560
there are sometimes operators that, so to speak, converge at the limit.

208
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,840
And they can be calculated efficiently. And the more the numbers get bigger,

209
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,160
the closer you get to a certain value. And this area is exactly the geometry.

210
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,680
And our own brain discovers a geometry to describe the world,

211
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,200
a certain function with which we can describe continuous surfaces and waves in the ocean,

212
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,880
and things that look like a circle and where we can zoom in at will within the resolution of our brain

213
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,680
and can find simple algebraic expressions with which one can calculate that, so to speak.

214
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,200
And we can also do that in computers. And from this point of view of constructive

215
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,280
mathematics, the world is just like that. So there is no continuous mathematics.

216
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,960
But before the calculation was discovered as a principle and the computer was discovered as a

217
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,080
principle, mathematicians assumed that there was a continuous world.

218
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,400
And what Gödel discovered was that this world, which we have, of course,

219
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,200
foreseen and the languages ​​we have built for it, lead to contradictions.

220
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,520
And that has shaken him very much. And from the point of view of computer scientists,

221
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,880
that is not a problem at all. Now let's go back to what Gödel said.

222
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,040
So we were at level three.

223
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,840
So we were there, the other team was looking for a computer.

224
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,800
The computer he found were the natural numbers.

225
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,480
And the great thing is that he just saw that the natural numbers with which I can

226
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,480
calculate any things. And so I can treat them as if I had a computer.

227
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,640
How can I make logic with it? And his idea was that I can write down my logic with a

228
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,160
formal system, i.e. as symbols, letters and characters.

229
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,800
For example, if I make a sign for and and a sign for or and a sign for a follows from

230
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,960
b and then I can have a sign for variables and then I have such a small alphabet.

231
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,000
And I convert that into numbers.

232
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
And ASCII code has not yet been invented, i.e. this American Standard Code of

233
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,600
Information Interchange, which was later solved by Unicode in the computer.

234
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,480
That's why he converted his alphabet into powers with prime numbers.

235
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
It was mathematically super clever.

236
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
It's called Goedelization and it's one of the main points when you try to understand

237
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,120
the sentence by Goedel, how he exactly converted the letters into numbers.

238
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
But that's not important, ASCII works just as well.

239
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
With huge numbers, definitely pretty fast.

240
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,240
Yes, but basically it's exactly like the numbers in the computer.

241
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
In your computer, there are only numbers in there that are written down with b and n

242
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,120
and you just have an alphabet that you can convert into numbers.

243
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,560
And the cool thing about it is that you can only take these numbers and that you

244
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,640
can develop formulas or functions that calculate your logical operations.

245
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,640
They just say, if these and those numbers are there with which my logical expressions

246
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
are written down and I calculate them together, how can I represent arithmetic,

247
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
simple things on peony axioms, on the operations in the natural numbers

248
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,640
with which I can calculate how the logic continues, what is the consequence of the logic.

249
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,720
So he built a practical computer out of natural numbers with which he could calculate

250
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
logical expressions, which is very clever.

251
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Turing took a different path.

252
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Turing invented the Turing machine for this.

253
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,720
The Turing machine is a tape that is infinitely long and has discrete symbols on it

254
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
that can be edited with a typewriter.

255
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,720
And the typewriter has a series of evidence with a small table with which it says,

256
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
if I read this symbol, I replace it with the following symbol, change my own condition

257
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
and go one field to the right or left.

258
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
And with that he can describe any operation.

259
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,800
And this Turing machine is closer to how our current computer works,

260
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
because there is an address pointer that points to an address in the memory of the computer

261
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,800
and in there is not a number from a certain alphabet,

262
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,800
for example a byte, 256 different values.

263
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,800
And I can interpret them as letters or numbers and then I can define operations

264
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,880
with these letters and numbers that I connect in a certain way to execute any computer program.

265
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,880
And with any computer program I can then define any logic.

266
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
That means they came to it on different paths.

267
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
And at the same time with Turing, who was a student of Wittgenstein,

268
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,880
who tried to translate the natural language into such a kind of logic,

269
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
there was Alonso Church, who came up with a different formalization

270
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
of the lambda calculation.

271
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,960
And the lambda calculation is simply an attempt to define calculations

272
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
by searching and substituting on symbols.

273
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,960
And the cool thing is that with this Hütchen calculation,

274
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
or with the lambda calculation, or with the searching and substituting calculation,

275
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,960
you can not only do regular expressions practically,

276
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
but you can also calculate the Turing machine with it.

277
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,960
And vice versa, you can define the Turing machine that calculates the lambda calculation.

278
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,960
And you can define the Turing machine that calculates the natural numbers.

279
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
That means they are all equal.

280
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,040
And the idea that all these calculation systems can do exactly the same thing

281
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
is the Church-Turing thesis.

282
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
So after naming Alonso Church and Alon Turing,

283
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,040
who had different approaches to calculation and found that they both can do the same thing.

284
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,040
So that we have a practical amount of languages that can do the same thing,

285
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
that are equal in their expressive power.

286
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Yes, and Gödel was, so to speak, a pioneer of the whole in his thinking,

287
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,120
who did this with the natural numbers.

288
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
And in the end he found something similar.

289
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
And he found that I can, in my language,

290
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,120
which calculates itself by translating it into natural languages,

291
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
express logical expressions.

292
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
And these logical expressions can be self-reliant,

293
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
because I can now build the language on myself.

294
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,120
And I can unfortunately have linguistic expressions that define the truth

295
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
and then say, I am wrong myself.

296
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,120
And that is ultimately what Tarski did,

297
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,200
he expressed expressions that were self-reliant and said, I am wrong myself.

298
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,200
And that is not compatible with our three basic rules of logic,

299
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
because now the thing is not true or false,

300
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
but it is something else.

301
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
It changes all the time, if you would evaluate it with a computer.

302
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
And for an computer scientist this is not a big problem.

303
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
The computer scientist simply says,

304
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
in my programming language,

305
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,200
you try to write the lambda calculation efficiently as computer programming language,

306
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I can define the truth with true and false.

307
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
And then I have a function that calculates it for my expression.

308
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
And now I calculate it and determine

309
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
as long as I haven't calculated it, it has no value.

310
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
And if the thing is self-reliant, it has no defined value,

311
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
but it constantly changes.

312
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
So no problem, I just defined it like that.

313
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
If you don't like it, then define it differently.

314
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,280
And in mathematics, is that a problem, at least in the way we understand it now?

315
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
In classical mathematics, exactly.

316
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
In pre-constructive mathematics.

317
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
But there was a time in mathematics,

318
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
before the mathematics of the way came

319
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
and the computation was invented as a concept,

320
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
already mathematicians like, for example, Brewer,

321
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
who said,

322
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
what we are doing here is not fine.

323
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,360
It leads to contradictions that may not be cleared up.

324
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
And he said,

325
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
the problem I see is infinity.

326
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Maybe we shouldn't allow infinity.

327
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
And then there was,

328
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
that was called intuitionism in mathematics.

329
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
And this intuitionism in mathematics

330
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
did not go very far.

331
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Most mathematicians found what he said not convincing.

332
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
And I think that's because

333
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
he didn't express his intuition well enough.

334
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
He saw something

335
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
and tried to formalize it,

336
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
but not so that the other mathematicians

337
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
saw everything he meant.

338
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
And that is in a certain way

339
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
that it fell on our feet

340
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
only later became visible.

341
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
And where you could guess that

342
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
were things like Hilbert's Hotel.

343
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Hilbert's Hotel is a hotel

344
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
that has a lot of rooms.

345
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
And these rooms are all fully booked.

346
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
And now a new guest comes on the way.

347
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
And the great thing is that this hotel

348
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
can accommodate the guest

349
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
because the porter simply

350
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
calls all rooms

351
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
and tells all guests,

352
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
go all one room number to the right.

353
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
And because it has an infinite number of rooms,

354
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
it's not a problem.

355
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
We now have one room free

356
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
and can accommodate the new guest.

357
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
And that's kind of very sad, isn't it?

358
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
What do we do now?

359
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Then the porter says to all guests,

360
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
please go to the double room number of yours.

361
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
And voila, we now have

362
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
an infinite number of rooms free

363
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
and can accommodate an infinite number of buses

364
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
with new guests.

365
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
And the mathematicians,

366
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
some of them thought it was good

367
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
because it's nice when you

368
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
get something out of nothing

369
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
and even get a lot.

370
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
But other people get stomach pain from it.

371
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Doesn't lead to problems at some point.

372
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
And one of the problems

373
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
was seen when Kantor

374
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
dealt with it.

375
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
And then he found that

376
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
when we define numbers in such a way

377
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
that it is the cardinality,

378
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
that is, the number of members of a set,

379
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
that is, how many we count,

380
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
we define number by number.

381
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
We simply say that a number is a number

382
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
of things that are in a quantity, for example.

383
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Then we can say that the number of members

384
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
that has a quantity is the number.

385
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
And there is an empty quantity,

386
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
and that corresponds to zero.

387
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
And otherwise we get all the numbers,

388
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
all the positive numbers,

389
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
as the number of members in there.

390
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
And because of the previous backward numbers

391
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
we also get negative numbers and so on

392
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
and can then deduct the rest from it.

393
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
And that leads to problems.

394
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
If we think about it,

395
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
that the amount of all subsets

396
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
of a quantity

397
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
can also be defined

398
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
and the amount of all subsets of a quantity

399
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
is greater than the amount of all members

400
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
It is clear, right?

401
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
So for the quantity of all subsets

402
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
for example, if we have four members,

403
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
these are all combinations

404
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
that these four members can have together.

405
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
And that is always more

406
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
than there are members.

407
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
And that would mean

408
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
if we have an infinitely large quantity

409
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
and an infinitely many members,

410
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
that the quantity of all subsets

411
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
must be greater than infinity.

412
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
So there are different infinities.

413
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
And can we do that?

414
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,920
But what happens

415
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
if we do the total quantity?

416
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
The quantity of all subsets

417
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
also has infinitely many members

418
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
and it is a very large kind of infinity

419
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
because it also contains the quantity of subsets.

420
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
But what about the quantity

421
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
of all subsets of the total quantity?

422
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
It also has more members

423
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
than the total quantity.

424
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
But the total quantity

425
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
must also contain all of them.

426
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
The quantity of all subsets.

427
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
And that leads to the unpleasant result

428
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
that the quantity of all subsets

429
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
does not have as many members

430
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
as the quantity of all subsets.

431
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That is, it leads to contradiction

432
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and this contradiction cannot be solved

433
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
without further explanation,

434
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
at least not in the quantity theory

435
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
because it is defined this way.

436
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And for computer scientists

437
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
this is not the problem

438
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
because they never have the problem

439
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
that infinitely many members are in there.

440
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The computer scientists would point out

441
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that this does not work at all

442
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
because they can only multiply with two.

443
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
And that means there are always only infinitely many

444
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
even if they become very large.

445
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
It will never go to infinity.

446
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
The only thing I can deal with

447
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
is unlimited, unboundedness.

448
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
And unlimited means

449
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
that I will never have a size

450
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
but that I only look at an area

451
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
where it gets bigger and bigger

452
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
and where I can still add something.

453
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
And I can find statements

454
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
about how unlimited works.

455
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
And at some point the numbers will become very large

456
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
For example, I can find out

457
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
that many corners

458
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,080
that are

459
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
and that have very large numbers of corners

460
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
are getting closer and closer to a circle.

461
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
And that is when I describe the ratio

462
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
of circumference and diameter

463
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
it always comes closer to a constant

464
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
that I can never determine exactly

465
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
but can always determine more precisely

466
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
the more I add corners, so to speak.

467
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I can do that.

468
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
And the computer scientists,

469
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
that you mathematicians always wanted to have.

470
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
You have never done more than that.

471
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
And if you want to describe the world,

472
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
that is exactly what you are doing.

473
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
And if you claimed that you have always had

474
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
infinity and continuity

475
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
and you write the outside of your function on it

476
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
and they unfold your functions

477
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
and look what you have secretly done

478
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
underneath the specification,

479
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
we notice that you never had infinity

480
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
but you have always only cheated.

481
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
In your code base of mathematics

482
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
you have always only dealt with finite things

483
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
and you have always developed tricks

484
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
with which you could deal with something similar

485
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
as infinity, but there was never infinity

486
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
but always only unlimitedness.

487
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Well, and that is possibly important

488
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
when we describe reality

489
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
because the physicists

490
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
have already checked out this code base

491
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
from mathematics in the 19th century.

492
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
So long before Gödel and Thuring

493
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
and Wittgenstein

494
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
and have infinity in there.

495
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
And that is not a big problem for the mechanics

496
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
because the mechanics only works in a nutritional way

497
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
and it is also not a problem for thermodynamics

498
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
but it is a problem for the foundation physics.

499
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
So for the basics of physics.

500
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Because where the lowest level of reality

501
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
is to be described,

502
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
if there are continuous objects in there

503
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,080
and the continuous objects can not even exist

504
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,080
because no reasonable language can exist

505
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
that does not fly around the ears,

506
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
then it means that we have to describe

507
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
the basics of physics

508
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
in a new way.

509
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
Yes, and all because we did not

510
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
listen to Brauer or Brewer.

511
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Yes, exactly.

512
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Or Pythagoras.

513
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Yes, Pythagoras.

514
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
Yes, and Pythagoras did not know yet

515
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
how to express it.

516
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
And from the current point of view, I would say

517
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
that the computer scientists express it correctly

518
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
by saying that it must be expressed

519
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
in a formal language that is predictable.

520
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
That means not only on my particular computer

521
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,080
but at least on theoretically

522
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
existing computers.

523
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,080
So on systems that

524
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
go from state to state in any way.

525
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Music

526
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Music

527
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
Music

528
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Music

529
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Music

530
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Music

531
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
So level 3 meant

532
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
that the formal language

533
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
in which we define the truth must be consistent.

534
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
And with Gödel we have now noticed

535
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
that at least the classical mathematics

536
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
does not have this consistency

537
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
because we have statements that are self-contradictory.

538
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Consistency means we have no contradictions,

539
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
we obviously have contradictions.

540
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
We have a system where we eventually come out

541
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
with computation

542
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
or with state transitions

543
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
within our formal language.

544
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Exactly.

545
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Franz, take level 4.

546
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Because we are currently

547
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
moving from level 4 to level 5.

548
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,080
We are now at level 4.

549
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
We are now at level 4.

550
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
We are now at level 4.

551
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
This follows.

552
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Gödel's theory proves

553
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
that logic is undecidable

554
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
and truth cannot generally be determined

555
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
by a mathematical procedure.

556
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
We have to build something else

557
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
that actually works.

558
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
And the thing is that this Gödel's

559
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
theory,

560
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
his two non-completeness statements,

561
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
the philosophers

562
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
in my opinion

563
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
did not really change the fabric.

564
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,080
And what the philosophers

565
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
find out when you look at

566
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
the literature and the discussion in philosophy

567
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
is, on the whole,

568
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,080
the mathematicians have proven

569
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
that mathematics is impotent to describe reality.

570
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Or even the ultimate relativism proof.

571
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
We can't find any statements

572
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
because everything is contradictory.

573
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
That would only be true if the philosophers

574
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
went home, which they don't do.

575
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
But what the philosophers find out is

576
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
that the mathematicians cannot describe the world.

577
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
And that gives people

578
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
who don't understand mathematics

579
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
an advantage,

580
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
namely the philosophers.

581
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
That means that the philosophers have

582
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
possibly techniques that are not accessible

583
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
to the mathematicians with their formal languages

584
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
and that the mathematicians can use

585
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
to capture reality.

586
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
And that is a very interesting question.

587
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
It leads to the assumption

588
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
that someone like Roger Penrose,

589
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
similar to the philosopher Lukas

590
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
in front of him,

591
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
that our mind is able

592
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,080
to perform operations

593
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
that go beyond what computers can do.

594
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
So for example to discover evidence

595
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
and to lead evidence

596
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
that computers cannot lead.

597
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
But the thing is that the evidence itself,

598
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
is a step-by-step

599
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
conversion of a statement

600
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
into axioms.

601
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
That is an algorithm,

602
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
that is what Greg Chaitin says.

603
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
And of course there are a few evidences

604
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
that work a little differently,

605
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
but these evidences can be derived from such evidences.

606
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
What do you say about the

607
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
example of ZFC or ZF,

608
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
that at least

609
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Russell's paradox

610
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
emerges and I think

611
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
you can also avoid

612
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
the paradoxes

613
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,080
that you just mentioned

614
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
with the amounts of potential

615
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
and the cardinalities.

616
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
But you also can't get

617
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
out of ZF, as far as I know.

618
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
And that means

619
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
that ZF is also

620
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
condemned to failure from the perspective.

621
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
They are all formal systems

622
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
that work under certain conditions

623
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
and do not work under other conditions.

624
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
And that means that

625
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
in order to bring the whole world into it,

626
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
only certain parts fit in.

627
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
And when I try to define

628
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
numbers myself,

629
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
and I am not a mathematician

630
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
or a philosopher of mathematics,

631
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
then it is quite informal. From my point of view,

632
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
the best way to define numbers

633
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
is a subsequent labeling scheme.

634
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
So it is a procedure

635
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
that allows me to

636
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
give places a new label,

637
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
in such a way that they are ordered.

638
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
And that gives me everything

639
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
that I want. It is simply an algorithm

640
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
with which I can represent

641
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
locations,

642
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
I can assign

643
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
a symbol to them.

644
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
And the way we

645
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
represent numbers in the simplest way

646
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
is that we say

647
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
zero, we don't need anything,

648
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
one we knock once, two we knock twice,

649
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
three we knock three times, four we knock

650
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
four times, and so on. And that

651
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
becomes very boring and long-winded

652
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
very quickly. And that's why

653
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
when we as humans

654
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
talk about numbers,

655
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
we try to compress them mentally.

656
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
And the compression algorithm

657
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
that we normally use for numbers

658
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
is, in our cultural circle,

659
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
that we form a tenor logarithm.

660
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
That means that we represent the size

661
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
of numbers. And that means

662
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
that we have tenors, one,

663
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
hundreds, thousands, and so on, and so on.

664
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
But we could also do it with other powers.

665
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
And the practical thing is

666
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
that we now have numbers,

667
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
we write numbers, describe them,

668
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
these regularities of numbers

669
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
in a small area, and we learn

670
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
a hash function. That's a function

671
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
that just represents a mapping,

672
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
an image from one number

673
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
to another, to make additions

674
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
in our head more efficient.

675
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
That means that we learn that

676
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
if we put two and three together, we get five.

677
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
And we learn that by heart.

678
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
And if we don't know how to do that,

679
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
we just count on our fingers. So we go back

680
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
to the knock once, twice, three times.

681
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
And by doing that, we can remember how

682
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
this hash function worked. And also

683
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
we have to learn how to transfer.

684
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
That means how to get from one number to the other.

685
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
That means we learn in simple algorithms

686
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
with which we can transfer in numbers

687
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
that we write cleverly and efficiently.

688
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
The tenor system is not optimal.

689
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
From my point of view,

690
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
we should have taken hexadecimal,

691
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
the sixteenth system.

692
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Because the nice thing about a sixteenth system

693
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
is that it's a two-year potential.

694
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
So that you can

695
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
multiply and divide.

696
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
Another system that is very nice

697
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
is the twelfth system.

698
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
What is totally cool about the twelfth system

699
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
is that it has so many parts. That means

700
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
you can describe circles very well with it.

701
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
And that's why we still use the twelfth system

702
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
to describe the clock and the angle.

703
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
You can also describe everything else

704
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
well with the twelfth system.

705
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
The tenor system is kind of stupid.

706
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
That's just because someone says,

707
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
I have ten fingers, let's take the tenor system.

708
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,080
It's totally suboptimal.

709
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
It's almost as good as the tenor system.

710
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
But you can do something much better

711
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
with twelfth potential.

712
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
There is of course another point.

713
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,080
The twelfth system is so cool

714
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
because you can work so well

715
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
with binary logic,

716
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
with true force 1.0,

717
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,080
with one polarity.

718
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
And this one polarity,

719
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
this one noticeable difference

720
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
to get back to our starting point

721
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
is so great as the minimum

722
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
from which you can build everything.

723
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,080
It's optimal.

724
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Maybe you shouldn't use a fourth system

725
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
or a fifth system as optimal and so on.

726
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
And apparently the optimal

727
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
is the third system,

728
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
the tenor logic.

729
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Why is it optimal?

730
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
That was explained to me

731
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
by the physicist Ed Fredkin.

732
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
And it has something to do with

733
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
when I imagine

734
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm building a memory chip

735
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
or a CPU,

736
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
so electronics,

737
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
and I try to build up the logic optimally,

738
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
then the question is

739
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
how does the size of my circuit behave,

740
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
how many more circuits do I need

741
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
if I want to form more possible states.

742
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
And this surface growth

743
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,080
that I need if I want to form more information

744
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
has something to do with

745
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
how many more digits I need.

746
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
For example, in the twelfth system

747
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I can form 256 different values

748
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
with 8 digits,

749
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
with one byte.

750
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080
So a three-digit decimal number

751
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080
or a two-digit hexadecimal number.

752
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,080
The hexadecimal would be the FF

753
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
of the 16 digits.

754
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
That's what you traditionally

755
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
call ABCDEF

756
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
for the digits

757
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
from 10 to 16.

758
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
And in the tenor system

759
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
you would take

760
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
for example 0 and minus 1 and 1

761
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,080
or 0, 1 and 2

762
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
and build up all the numbers from them.

763
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,080
And the cool thing is

764
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
that it's more about the optimal growth rate.

765
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,080
And the optimal growth rate

766
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,080
is the number E.

767
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,080
And E is

768
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
2.81,

769
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
it goes on, I don't know exactly,

770
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
embarrassingly.

771
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,080
And 3 is the number

772
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
that's next to it.

773
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,080
And Fredkin

774
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
was a very wild physicist

775
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
who had totally crazy ideas.

776
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
But this idea

777
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
was checked.

778
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
There was a Russian

779
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,080
who built a computer in the Soviet Union

780
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,080
who built terrestrial logic

781
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,080
and they could show that they are more energy efficient

782
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
and have less optimal

783
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
circuits than the binary system.

784
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
But since the world started

785
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,080
with the binary system and already

786
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
adjusted to it and so much theory and practice

787
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
existed, we stayed with it.

788
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
I just understand father-dependency

789
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
like the tessitura layout and things like that.

790
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Exactly.

791
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,080
We have to redesign at some point.

792
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,080
But it's also not bad, because in the end

793
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
it's equivalent.

794
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
And the fourth shows that

795
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,080
we haven't been able to use

796
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,080
this original mathematical logic

797
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
since Ergödel.

798
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,080
By the way, the Russellian Antinomy

799
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
maybe we can explain it for the listeners.

800
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Do you want to?

801
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
The Russellian Antinomy

802
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
is either used as

803
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,080
Barbara's paradox, right?

804
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
There's the

805
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,080
razor, no, what's his name?

806
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,080
The hairdresser.

807
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
The one who razes everyone in his village

808
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,080
except the ones who

809
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
shave themselves.

810
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,080
The ones who don't...

811
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,080
We didn't catch that well.

812
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
The ones who don't shave themselves.

813
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Exactly.

814
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
And then of course the question is

815
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,080
does he shave himself?

816
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
That's a contradiction.

817
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
Let's go through it so that we can listen

818
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,080
and not think about it.

819
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Yes.

820
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,080
Do you want to do it or what?

821
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,080
Just go close to the microphone.

822
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,080
You don't have to...

823
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,080
So that you can think about it again.

824
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,080
If the razor razes everyone who doesn't shave

825
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,080
himself, it's of course the question who

826
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,080
razes the razor.

827
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
And if he doesn't shave himself,

828
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,080
then it means he's one of the instances

829
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,080
that are shaved, because he razes

830
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
everyone who doesn't shave himself.

831
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
And that means he razes himself, but as soon as

832
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,080
he razes himself, he doesn't shave himself.

833
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
It's always stupid when you express it in

834
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,080
words.

835
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,080
Of course, it's a theoretical amount.

836
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
The amount of all the amounts that don't

837
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,080
shave themselves.

838
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,080
If they shave themselves, then they

839
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,080
shouldn't shave themselves.

840
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
If they don't shave themselves, then they

841
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,080
have to shave themselves, because they

842
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
have all the amounts that don't shave

843
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
themselves.

844
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Maybe we'll show you some graphs.

845
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
But why is that even a problem?

846
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,080
It's a problem because the

847
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,080
way that shaving is done in this

848
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,080
place, and with the language they express

849
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,080
an expression that is valid.

850
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,080
It considers all rules of this

851
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,080
language, and yet it leads

852
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,080
this sentence into contradictions.

853
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,080
It simply leads to the fact that you can't

854
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
make a valid statement about the

855
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,080
hairdresser himself and find out if

856
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
he's shaving himself or not.

857
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,080
It's not a problem for the computer scientists.

858
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,080
The computer scientists are familiar with the fact

859
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
that you can make specifications for

860
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,080
which there is no implementation.

861
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,080
That means that the thing doesn't even exist.

862
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
The customer wants it,

863
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,080
he says,

864
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,080
I want this and that,

865
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,080
and you as a computer scientist look at it

866
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,080
and say, I'm sorry, it doesn't work, I can

867
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,080
prove that it doesn't work.

868
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,080
And for the computer scientists it's not a problem at all,

869
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,080
they're used to the fact that the world works that way.

870
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,080
That the language, if you use it

871
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,080
inappropriately, leads to

872
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,080
things that are said in the language

873
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,080
that have nothing to do with the world.

874
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,080
And the only languages that can say

875
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,080
that always agree with the world

876
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,080
are the languages in which

877
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
the implementation itself takes place.

878
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,080
That is, there is a difference between

879
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,080
syntax and semantics, classically.

880
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,080
Semantics is the meaning

881
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,080
that the language has, and the syntax

882
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,080
are the rules by which the language

883
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,080
is calculated, that is, in which

884
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,080
the language is written and evaluated.

885
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,080
And originally

886
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
people in mathematics

887
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,080
assumed that

888
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,080
the syntax and the semantics

889
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,080
are related to each other, and that

890
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,080
they can be depicted on top of each other,

891
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,080
but that they are fundamentally different.

892
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,080
And in computer science

893
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
the semantics of a language is the

894
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
causal structure that the language has,

895
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,080
so what the computer program does at the end.

896
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
And the computer program always does

897
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,080
something, and maybe it doesn't do

898
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,080
what you want, but that's not the problem

899
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,080
of this language, that's your problem,

900
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,080
that you use the language in a way

901
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
that doesn't mean what the language actually means.

902
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080
And from my point of view

903
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,080
you can interpret existence

904
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,080
in such a way that you say

905
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,080
to exist means to be implemented.

906
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
To be implemented means

907
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,080
that there is a system somewhere

908
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,080
that works in such a way

909
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,080
that what is described there happens.

910
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,080
And that is exactly that.

911
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,080
This is a very general term

912
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
of implementation. You could, for example, say

913
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,080
is there really money, or is it just

914
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,080
a way of talking about things?

915
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,080
And you could say, is there really money

916
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,080
in the way that money is implemented?

917
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,080
So there are symbol systems

918
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,080
in the world, and there are agreements

919
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,080
and meanings, there are causal structures

920
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,080
that lead to money being there.

921
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,080
And that exists from certain points of view,

922
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,080
and it doesn't exist from other points of view.

923
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,080
It depends on the language that I use

924
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,080
and the causal structures

925
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,080
that exist from the point of view

926
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,080
of this language. And there are certain

927
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,080
moments when the money doesn't exist,

928
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,080
where, for example,

929
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,080
a central bank looks at the thing

930
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,080
and says, it doesn't work anymore, we have to

931
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,080
change the currency.

932
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,080
And at that moment the money stops

933
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,080
to exist for a moment, and

934
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,080
then the money is reinvented,

935
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,080
so to speak, as a kind of software.

936
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,080
And compared to our

937
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,080
poor hairdresser,

938
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,080
the whole thing looks like

939
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,080
that the mathematician has taken the

940
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,080
liberty of using a language

941
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
that doesn't describe anything

942
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,080
in the borderline.

943
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
Or he has the claim

944
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,080
that it describes something, and

945
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,080
doesn't do anything about it.

946
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,080
Because there obviously can't be this hairdresser.

947
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,080
What the mathematician has done now,

948
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,080
he has just invented a rule

949
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,080
for a kind of game,

950
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,080
and this rule is not solvable, not solvable.

951
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,080
There can't be a game that works like that.

952
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,080
And we can prove that it doesn't work like that.

953
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
And that means, don't expect it to work like that.

954
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,080
We can't build a computer program

955
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,080
that works like that.

956
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,080
Very briefly, sorry.

957
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,080
So there is no hairdresser

958
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,080
who doesn't shave themselves.

959
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,080
Yes, there simply can't be one.

960
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,080
There can't be one, and you can't even

961
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,080
really imagine it, by the way.

962
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
That's also a bit counterintuitive.

963
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,080
You think, oh, there you imagine something

964
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
that you can't implement, but even the

965
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,080
imagination doesn't work. Even that breaks

966
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,080
in when you switch back and forth,

967
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,080
and you can't stabilize it.

968
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,080
That's also important.

969
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,080
If we now move on

970
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
to the next stage,

971
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
which says

972
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
that all consistent notions

973
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,080
of truth are computational,

974
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,080
and the Church-Turing thesis says that

975
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,080
all computational languages are equivalent.

976
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,080
So what that means is

977
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,080
that after Gürtel's theorem has proven

978
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,080
to us that logic is

979
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,080
indecisive and that truth

980
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,080
cannot be defined in general by a mathematical

981
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,080
procedure, it means that

982
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,080
we have simply misdefined truth.

983
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,080
If truth is defined in such a way

984
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
that it doesn't have to

985
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,080
rely on hairdressers who don't shave themselves,

986
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,080
then the truth has simply been misdefined.

987
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,080
That means we need

988
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,080
a different theory of truth.

989
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,080
We need a theory of truth that

990
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,080
can be described in such a way

991
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,080
that you can always determine what is true.

992
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
That means the truth depends on the

993
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,080
procedure with which you determine it.

994
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
And that means, if you claim that

995
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,080
something is true, you have to indicate

996
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
with which procedure you come to the truth.

997
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,080
And if this procedure doesn't exist

998
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,080
or you can't indicate it,

999
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,080
then you don't have a theory of truth.

1000
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,080
How long did it take you to come to the truth?

1001
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
That's the question.

1002
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Are you able to build a system

1003
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,080
that takes endless steps?

1004
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,080
It's not just a practical question,

1005
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,080
but also a theoretical question.

1006
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,080
Is there a hypothetical universe

1007
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,080
in which mathematics exists

1008
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,080
where you can do that? And it doesn't work.

1009
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
You get the bounding,

1010
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,080
but what you don't get is

1011
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,080
the infinity.

1012
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,080
You only get the infinity

1013
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,080
if you assume it's already there.

1014
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
It's like a little black box

1015
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
from which the infinity comes out.

1016
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
But when you open the box,

1017
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
you don't see anything in there that makes sense.

1018
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
In ZF, for example, there's the infinity axiom.

1019
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,080
It's introduced by axiom.

1020
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,080
Exactly. That's the box you take

1021
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
and you look at a real universe

1022
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,080
as an observer.

1023
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Real doesn't necessarily mean physical,

1024
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,080
but some hypothetical.

1025
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,080
For example, in a computer language,

1026
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,080
I build a hypothetical computer.

1027
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,080
What would it look like

1028
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,080
if I implemented it?

1029
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,080
What would the subroutine look like?

1030
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
That's not possible.

1031
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,080
We're still at level 4-5.

1032
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,080
We're going over to level 5.

1033
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,080
We refer to the mathematical logic

1034
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,080
that Götel believed in.

1035
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,080
And we say to Götel

1036
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
that the vibration doesn't come from

1037
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
the fact that you realized

1038
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
that mathematics doesn't work,

1039
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
but that you used the wrong mathematics.

1040
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
There's a mathematics that works,

1041
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,080
and that mathematics is

1042
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,080
the constructive mathematics.

1043
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,080
The modern name for constructive mathematics

1044
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
is computation.

1045
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
We've already talked about infinity.

1046
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,080
It's about the fact that

1047
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,080
you can't observe infinity.

1048
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,080
Every observation is necessarily

1049
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
a discrete, finite bit vector.

1050
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,080
You can't observe infinitely

1051
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,080
and then close it off.

1052
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,080
It doesn't work.

1053
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
Empirically, you can't get it in.

1054
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,080
You can't construct it.

1055
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,080
You can't start to formulate

1056
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,080
or build something and get it done.

1057
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,080
If it's infinite,

1058
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,080
it can't be finished by definition.

1059
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,080
If it's infinite, then you get

1060
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,080
contradictions like the razor paradox

1061
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,080
that we just talked about

1062
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
and like the problem of holding.

1063
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,080
I wanted to talk about holding.

1064
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
The question is, why is holding

1065
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,080
a problem at all?

1066
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,080
What Thuring tried to do

1067
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,080
was to train

1068
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,080
classical mathematics

1069
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,080
into computer programs.

1070
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,080
But that also means

1071
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,080
that I have computer programs

1072
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,080
that may have to run infinitely long.

1073
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,080
Where I can't determine

1074
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,080
the number of steps.

1075
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,080
The holding problem says

1076
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,080
that there is no algorithm

1077
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
that can determine for any

1078
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,080
unknown algorithm

1079
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,080
if it ever comes to an end.

1080
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,080
Whether you stop after an infinite number of steps

1081
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,080
or stay in an infinite loop.

1082
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,080
You can prove

1083
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,080
that the holding problem

1084
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,080
is due to

1085
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,080
reductio ad absurdum,

1086
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,080
through negation

1087
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,080
of the holding problem.

1088
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,080
If you assume

1089
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,080
that there is a computer

1090
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
that solves the holding problem,

1091
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,080
then you could build

1092
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,080
a loop

1093
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,080
that determines

1094
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,080
that the algorithm is terminated.

1095
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,080
Then the thing runs into an infinite loop.

1096
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,080
If I build the thing

1097
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,080
on the next step,

1098
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,080
to solve the holding problem,

1099
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080
then the assumption that

1100
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,080
I can solve the holding problem leads

1101
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,080
to the fact that I can never build a computer

1102
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,080
that solves the holding problem

1103
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,080
for mathematical abstract reasons.

1104
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,080
In reality,

1105
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,080
the holding problem

1106
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,080
does not apply to computer science.

1107
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
The thing is that

1108
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,080
normally my program

1109
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,080
should come to an end

1110
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,080
after an infinite number of steps.

1111
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,080
I know how many there are.

1112
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,080
It should be finished today.

1113
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,080
Or it should be finished before I die.

1114
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,080
That means I can just let the computer run

1115
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,080
until it has a result.

1116
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,080
If it doesn't, I just stop.

1117
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
In our own consciousness,

1118
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,080
we can only perform

1119
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,080
so many operations in our cells

1120
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,080
and neurons.

1121
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,080
If we don't have a result

1122
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,080
after a certain time,

1123
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,080
we can't remember what happened before

1124
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,080
because we didn't live at that time

1125
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,080
or were already dead

1126
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,080
or asleep.

1127
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,080
We always have to assume

1128
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,080
that we can only perform

1129
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,080
until we have the result.

1130
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,080
The results of the holding problem

1131
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,080
are of theoretical interest,

1132
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
not practical.

1133
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,080
The theoretical interest

1134
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,080
has to do with the basics of logic

1135
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
or the basics of mathematics

1136
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
when I try to translate them into computer science.

1137
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,080
The holding problem is that

1138
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,080
there are classes of functions

1139
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,080
that are allowed in mathematics,

1140
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,080
but that are not determinable in computer science.

1141
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,080
I can't build a machine

1142
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,080
or a theory that is able

1143
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,080
to calculate these functions.

1144
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,080
The problem is that

1145
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,080
before the computer was invented

1146
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,080
or this concept was invented,

1147
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,080
people thought that

1148
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
the evaluation of logical expressions

1149
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
or the mathematics and interpretation

1150
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
of language worked.

1151
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
They thought that they could do more

1152
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,080
than what any interpretation system could do.

1153
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1154
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1155
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1156
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1157
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1158
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1159
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1160
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1161
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1162
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1163
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1164
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1165
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1166
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1167
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1168
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1169
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1170
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1171
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1172
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1173
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1174
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,080
Let's go back to the beginning.

1175
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,080
I went to the Berlin School of Mind and Brain

1176
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,080
for some time.

1177
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
I worked on 손역은 because I was

1178
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,080
that didn't fit into the project that took place at the time.

1179
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,080
But at the same time, I found out that I was allowed to learn

1180
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:30,080
and organized a seminar on the philosophy of computationalism,

1181
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,080
the basics of representation in computationalism.

1182
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Among other things, I went through the lambda calculus with the students,

1183
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,080
step by step, how it works. It's not that difficult to understand.

1184
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,080
The Turing machine, step by step, is also not that difficult to understand,

1185
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,080
except for the lowest basics and why they are equivalent.

1186
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,080
After that, I asked the students what they think is more powerful.

1187
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,080
A majority of the students in the vote said that the lambda calculus is more powerful

1188
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,080
because it can make things parallel and the Turing machine only sequentially.

1189
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,080
The thing is, however, that time doesn't matter at all,

1190
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,080
but I can represent them one by one.

1191
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,080
And there are no statements about how fast it runs in the world.

1192
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,080
In fact, they are exactly the same because I can represent them

1193
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,080
one by one with a very simple procedure.

1194
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,080
And this realization that all computational systems can do the same,

1195
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,080
that's the Church-Turing thesis.

1196
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,080
But that means that I can use any of these systems

1197
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,080
to describe the entire reality.

1198
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:35,080
That means I can just take a Turing machine and put it into nothing,

1199
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,080
and then the whole universe runs on it.

1200
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,080
And that brings us to the next point.

1201
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:47,080
That means, every consistently described universe is equivalent

1202
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,080
to some kind of Turing machine,

1203
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,080
which is actually a finite but possibly unbounded automaton,

1204
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,080
but we can never know what has put a Turing machine into the void.

1205
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,080
Maybe we should briefly talk about the term automaton.

1206
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,080
The automaton is a kind of calculation to be defined

1207
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,080
by discrete state transitions.

1208
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,080
And the cellular automaton is very well known.

1209
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:17,080
The cellular automaton is a thing that uses cells next to each other.

1210
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,080
They can be, for example, in 1D or 2D.

1211
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,080
And then there is a rule that says that the configuration

1212
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,080
of the states of the cells goes into the next configurations.

1213
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,080
A well-known automaton is, for example, the Game of Life.

1214
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,080
It is a very nice automaton that was discovered by John Conway,

1215
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,080
and it is two-dimensional.

1216
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,080
And that means that it is just a little box thing

1217
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,080
where each cell, like on a little box of paper,

1218
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,080
has eight neighbors around it.

1219
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,080
So three times three is exactly the eight neighbors of the middle cell.

1220
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,080
And each cell can have exactly one of two states,

1221
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,080
namely living or dead, that is, filled or empty.

1222
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:05,080
We can say in the Game of Life that if a cell has more than three neighbors,

1223
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,080
then it dies of infection.

1224
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:14,080
And if there are two or three, then you stay alive.

1225
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,080
Because if there are exactly three, you come to life.

1226
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,080
If there are less than two, more than three, you die.

1227
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,080
Exactly, so actually only two rules and the other implicit is already in there.

1228
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:26,080
And these rules lead to the fact that if you have a random configuration of cells

1229
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,080
that they start blubbering and that after a certain time patterns are created there.

1230
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,080
And these patterns are always periodic at the end.

1231
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:41,080
And in the boring case, the period is one or zero.

1232
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,080
And that means that nothing is there anymore.

1233
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,080
But the patterns can also have relatively complex periods.

1234
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,080
So very long, complicated patterns are created.

1235
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,080
And sometimes it takes a long time for them to go over to such a periodic pattern.

1236
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,080
And you can build very interesting structures in this world of the Game of Life,

1237
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,080
for example the so-called gliders.

1238
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:03,080
The glider is a kind of particle that plants itself.

1239
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:08,080
That is, it is a pattern that changes its surroundings in such a way

1240
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,080
that new cells come to life on its edge and die on the opposite edge of the cell.

1241
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,080
And this is how this glider walks through the world one by one.

1242
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,080
And the gliders that you see there, they are called gliders.

1243
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,080
And the gliders that you have discovered, they move horizontally or vertically.

1244
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,080
And from the gliders you can build structures that exchange information.

1245
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:36,080
For example, computers, where the glider is a kind of bit that flies through the area

1246
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:41,080
and then triggers a circuit that generates new gliders,

1247
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,080
a glider cannon that periodically shoots new gliders.

1248
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,080
And if you aim the glider cannon correctly, then you can shoot broken glider cannons

1249
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,080
or shoot again functionally and can practically build transistor logic with it

1250
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:58,080
and then build a new Game of Life on the next level, for example.

1251
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:03,080
If you zoom out, it looks like the Game of Life and re-images itself.

1252
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,080
The Game of Life is Turing complete.

1253
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,080
And there was a competition between Steven Wolfram and Marvin Minsky

1254
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:13,080
about what is the easiest cellular machine that is Turing complete.

1255
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:20,080
And it is also such a simple rule that can be defined in one-dimensionally automated machines.

1256
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:26,080
And that means that you look at the initial state as the tape of a Turing machine

1257
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,080
and the rule that is applied on it is what describes how the evolution is going on.

1258
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,080
Then you can convert that into any computer.

1259
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,080
Who won? Was it Wolfram and Rohan?

1260
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:42,080
They never really agreed because it depends on what you expect.

1261
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:49,080
With Wolfram it was like this, that one of his employees published the machines that they had found all over the place

1262
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,080
before Wolfram did that.

1263
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Wolfram was so smart that he sued the employee for copyright infringement.

1264
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,080
I think in very rare cases in the history of mathematics,

1265
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,080
where a mathematician was sued for copyright for publishing a proof,

1266
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:08,080
which somehow made many people very angry at Wolfram.

1267
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,080
When you talk about Turing complete systems or abstract computers,

1268
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,080
they are actually only abstract definitions of computations,

1269
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,080
so what this system can theoretically do.

1270
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,080
And it turns out that such systems, Turing complete systems like the Game of Life

1271
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,080
or the abstract computer that Goethe came up with about the piano axioms or a Turing machine,

1272
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,080
what is the difference between these systems?

1273
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,080
Turing complete systems like the Game of Life or the abstract computer

1274
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,080
that Goethe came up with about the piano axioms or a Turing machine,

1275
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,080
which is also an abstract thing, or lambda calculus, and the rules of Wolfram.

1276
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,080
In the end, they are any pattern generator.

1277
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,080
So all patterns that can be generated can be generated from these things.

1278
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,080
A pattern is defined as a lot of recognizable differences.

1279
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,080
So patterns are discrete, finite structures, but they can be very large.

1280
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:35,080
And now you are at a point where you realize that when you talk about the universe,

1281
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,080
you are actually only talking about a large collection of recognizable differences,

1282
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,080
so a large collection of patterns.

1283
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,080
And then you can say, well, the universe for me is the amount of all my observations,

1284
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,080
in my case also the amount of all observations from other people or measuring instruments and so on and so forth.

1285
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,080
But in the end, what you mean by the universe, when you refer to the observation,

1286
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,080
is a very, very large and yet finally discrete bit vector.

1287
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,080
And this can be produced by a Turing complete system.

1288
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:06,080
That is, you are on the level that you simply say, well, from my perspective,

1289
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:11,080
the necessary condition for the amount of all my observations is a Turing complete system,

1290
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:16,080
some pattern generator. And from my perspective, the universe is a random pattern generator.

1291
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,080
So that was my step. But I don't know why that's there.

1292
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,080
That would be in the field of metaphysics, where cool people like Wolfram, for example,

1293
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:29,080
dare to get out of the field of metaphysics and really want to explain.

1294
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,080
Wolfram's idea of physics was, instead of, so to speak,

1295
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:38,080
to reverse-engineer physics, that is, to transfer our observations from the world

1296
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:43,080
into a series of formulas and then simplify these formulas so far

1297
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,080
that you have less and less at the end. Why is that?

1298
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,080
Standard model is practically half a page full of formulas,

1299
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,080
where you need a long time to understand the individual formulas, what they mean,

1300
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,080
but it's still half a page code, so to speak.

1301
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:59,080
And Wolfram's idea is, of course, that it's still way too long.

1302
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,080
There has to be a simple rule from which everything is derived.

1303
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,080
And what do I think of this simple rule?

1304
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,080
I could simply number all the cellular machines that exist

1305
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,080
and search for something like our universe at the end.

1306
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,080
And then I would find out which of these machines we are in.

1307
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,080
And the question that is still open, the spoiler,

1308
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,080
Wolfram has not been able to find these machines so far.

1309
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:28,080
And the idea is, I think, brilliant to say that we are trying to search for physics from another series,

1310
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,080
that we are trying to say all possible laws of the series,

1311
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,080
through which the world can be expressed.

1312
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:39,080
This is of course very difficult, because it could be that it is difficult

1313
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,080
to simulate a computer program that comes out clearly over the clock,

1314
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,080
simply because you have to look at so many elements at once.

1315
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:50,080
And the other question is, where does this Turing machine come from now?

1316
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,080
So what has this Turing machine done in the lesson?

1317
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,080
Why is there something rather than nothing?

1318
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:59,080
And that is the question that you are confronted with at this level.

1319
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,080
And this question has no obvious answer.

1320
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,080
By the way, with all theories that are still there,

1321
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,080
even if people say they find computation strange,

1322
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,080
so far everyone has had the problem that you need any first cause,

1323
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,080
the first movement or something, why is there nothing?

1324
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,080
Exactly. And Christianity was not so helpful,

1325
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:24,080
because many of these considerations, which played a role in defining a civilization spirit,

1326
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:32,080
so a total god, god is, I think we atheists often don't really understand what god means,

1327
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:39,080
but god is a technical term, and god is something similar to the human self,

1328
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:44,080
the self is a technical term, the self is a model of a person that is created in our brain

1329
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,080
about ourselves, and that we use to move and understand ourselves in the world.

1330
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,080
And this includes, for example, that we perceive ourselves as human beings,

1331
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:56,080
and that we have a biography, and that we make decisions ourselves,

1332
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,080
and have expectations of the future, and have certain identifications.

1333
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,080
And all of this is in a self-model and definitely what kind of agent we are,

1334
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,080
so this personal, human self.

1335
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,080
And this is not identical to our consciousness.

1336
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,080
Our consciousness is also a kind of self, but it is a more minimal self,

1337
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:18,080
in which practically an observer perceives himself while observing,

1338
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,080
even before he has a language or something else,

1339
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,080
and this minimal self is a kind of attention self,

1340
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:31,080
where practically the observer perceives himself as the thing that has attention.

1341
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:35,080
And the personal self is already much more charged up, has much more properties,

1342
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:41,080
it has a first-person perspective and the identification with the way we are in the world.

1343
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:48,080
And besides this personal self, from which exactly one normally exists per human spirit,

1344
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,080
then you have such a multiple personality disorder,

1345
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:57,080
there are also selfs that can exist beyond several spirits, and they are called gods.

1346
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:03,080
So gods are clusters of agentic properties that stabilize,

1347
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:09,080
and which, for example via memes or through interactions with each other,

1348
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:15,080
or through archetypes, that is, they are discovered regardless of each other on different spirits,

1349
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:19,080
but because of the same observer, the same world and the same mathematical principles,

1350
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:26,080
they lead to the fact that practically effective agents are created that exist beyond a single spirit.

1351
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:32,080
And political societies are some in which the problem of coordination

1352
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:37,080
over individual self-sufficient agents is solved in such a way that spirits are supported

1353
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,080
in their formation beyond the different spirits.

1354
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,080
That is, it is not only the case that the individual people in the world interact with each other,

1355
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,080
but also selfs that do not define themselves as human beings,

1356
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:52,080
but are there as principles beyond human beings, for example social principles.

1357
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:57,080
For example, there is a god of harvest that leads people to coordinate themselves

1358
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,080
so that they experience themselves as an agent who now brings in the harvest,

1359
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,080
and they all have to serve the individual spirit, the individual body.

1360
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,080
And in monotheism it is the case that all these gods are made illegal, forbidden,

1361
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,080
and say, no, there is only one god, and that is the god of our civilization.

1362
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Originally for the Hebrews it is the god of the tribe,

1363
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,080
and for the Catholics it is the attempt to transfer the Roman Empire,

1364
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,080
which was relatively rational, but also partly political,

1365
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:29,080
into a kind of cult, and they branched or forged it from the Hebrew cult,

1366
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:36,080
and complemented it with Jesus, the Middle Eastern gnostic,

1367
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,080
who was killed by the Romans at the time because he was too arrogant.

1368
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,080
They take him in to define the aesthetics of this new cult,

1369
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
and then they define a single god.

1370
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,080
And we find this single god, each one of us,

1371
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,080
by searching for the perfect god,

1372
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:56,080
so after the one who is created by the fact that everyone does what should be done best.

1373
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,080
If you think about it, you can deduce from it what this agent looks like.

1374
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,080
Is that what is created when everyone does what should be done best,

1375
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:07,080
an agent at all, a control system for future conditions?

1376
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Yes, otherwise it would be less perfect.

1377
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,080
So it should be something that performs control functions,

1378
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,080
and it should be the perfect thing that performs control functions.

1379
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,080
And compared to the Hebrew god, who is then, for example,

1380
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,080
jealous and angry, and makes a lot of decisions,

1381
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:25,080
from which you ask yourself, is it optimal to use a shark shark rain,

1382
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,080
or to kill the newborns, or something like that.

1383
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,080
This is expanded in Christianity, so to speak.

1384
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:35,080
Then we think, no, we are not looking for what this tribe thought back then,

1385
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,080
what this entity then did, or not,

1386
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,080
but we think about what would happen in the ideal case,

1387
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,080
what is the perfect system.

1388
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,080
And the philosophers of Catholicism, especially Thomas Aquinas,

1389
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,080
thought very seriously about how to specify this god.

1390
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,080
And he put a number of things into the specifications

1391
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,080
that do not belong in there from my point of view.

1392
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,080
And I say that now as someone who has no idea about theology

1393
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,080
and who only says it from his personal point of view,

1394
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,080
without any great demand to get it right.

1395
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,080
But the idea that the perfect god,

1396
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,080
even the one who created the universe,

1397
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,080
is more or less an empirical question for me,

1398
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,080
that I can decide a priori.

1399
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,080
So to consider whether God is an agent,

1400
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,080
if I try to see him as an optimal agent,

1401
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,080
which results in everyone who discovers him serving him,

1402
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,080
I see that one can derive this a priori,

1403
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,080
under certain circumstances, without any conditions.

1404
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,080
But the idea that our universe was created by him,

1405
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,080
that does not really show up.

1406
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,080
From my point of view, it is true that the monotheistic god

1407
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,080
was discovered only 6,000 years ago,

1408
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,080
and before that there are no traces of it.

1409
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,080
And that means that it is in its form a human discovery.

1410
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,080
And this human discovery is possibly not an absolute discovery,

1411
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,080
but has had certain conditions

1412
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,080
that people had to develop certain cultures

1413
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,080
that brought them to these ideas.

1414
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,080
And this entity may actually only arise

1415
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,080
through the interaction of people

1416
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,080
who discover this entity and want to serve it.

1417
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,080
That means as a civilisation spirit,

1418
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,080
not as a creator god who created a physical universe.

1419
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
So there is a trick,

1420
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,080
that you try to bring together the unknown

1421
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,080
with an answer that is comfortable,

1422
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,080
and the one with this god of civilisation,

1423
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,080
with whom you try to discipline and harmonize your population,

1424
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,080
and to make your behaviour coherent.

1425
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
And I think that's how you get into trouble,

1426
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,080
if you don't bring this back to an empirical question.

1427
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,080
Practically, this also leads to logical contradictions,

1428
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,080
because this god is not structureless,

1429
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,080
he has properties, so that he can be effective.

1430
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,080
He has to be structural.

1431
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,080
And that means that he is not free of conditions.

1432
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,080
And he is not suitable as a condition for the physical universe.

1433
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,080
So if he is a condition for the physical universe,

1434
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,080
then the physical universe becomes a kind of simulation

1435
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,080
that is created by him, is conceivable.

1436
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,080
Maybe our god is a being

1437
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,080
that existed in the next higher universe,

1438
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,080
and created this universe as a kind of computer simulation.

1439
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,080
But that doesn't change the fact,

1440
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,080
that this next higher universe

1441
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
also has to be conceivable in some language.

1442
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,080
In the broadest sense, with some mathematical language.

1443
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,080
And that's where this god has to fall out.

1444
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,080
How do I get this precondition-free universe

1445
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,080
where the world is created by itself?

1446
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,080
And this question, why is there anything at all,

1447
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:36,080
is a question that I haven't seen a satisfying answer for a long time.

1448
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,080
And for me it was the point where I realized,

1449
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,080
okay, now it's working.

1450
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,080
When I read a text by the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce,

1451
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,080
he wrote about existence and non-existence

1452
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,080
in this short chapter.

1453
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,080
And he states that you can describe the non-existence

1454
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,080
by zero and the existence by one.

1455
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,080
And then he says,

1456
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,080
you could also describe the non-existence

1457
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,080
by the negation of existence,

1458
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,080
so by minus one.

1459
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,080
So there is one way to exist

1460
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,080
and two ways not to exist.

1461
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,080
And I read that and thought,

1462
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,080
that's nonsense.

1463
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,080
You didn't discover that there is one way to exist

1464
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,080
and two ways not to exist,

1465
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,080
but you found labels

1466
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,080
for existence and non-existence.

1467
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,080
And there are infinitely many,

1468
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,080
so unlimitedly many,

1469
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,080
that you can create.

1470
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,080
And what you used

1471
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,080
and put forward for that

1472
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,080
is a system of numbers.

1473
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,080
And the piano axiom,

1474
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,080
this system of numbers,

1475
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,080
is so powerful that you can build

1476
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,080
a whole universe out of it,

1477
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,080
so it's not conditional.

1478
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,080
That means you trick yourself,

1479
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,080
you pretend that zero and one

1480
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,080
are already there out of nothing.

1481
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,080
And from that you talk about existence

1482
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,080
and non-existence.

1483
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,080
But can we talk about non-existence

1484
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,080
out of existence?

1485
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,080
Actually not, right?

1486
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,080
That means we can't talk about existence

1487
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,080
and non-existence

1488
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,080
at the lowest level of the universe

1489
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,080
because there is nothing there.

1490
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,080
That means the universe itself

1491
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,080
outside of itself

1492
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,080
is not determined

1493
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,080
about its existence and non-existence.

1494
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,080
It doesn't know if it exists or not.

1495
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,080
And that means,

1496
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,080
if I assume it's conditional,

1497
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,080
that the default,

1498
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,080
is not that the universe doesn't exist

1499
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,080
or that there is nothing there,

1500
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,080
but that you can't know

1501
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,080
if it exists or not.

1502
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,080
If the universe is possible,

1503
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,080
that means there is an existing

1504
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,080
and non-existent branch.

1505
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,080
And the non-existent branch

1506
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,080
doesn't contain any observers

1507
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
who will complain.

1508
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,080
And all the observers who have complaints

1509
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,080
are us in the existing branch.

1510
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,080
And what we have to explain now

1511
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,080
is that after we have

1512
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,080
derived from the existence

1513
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,080
and the fact that

1514
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,080
there is nothing in the universe

1515
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,080
that prevents that,

1516
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,080
why are certain things there

1517
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,080
and other things not there?

1518
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,080
Why does the universe

1519
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,080
have this structure

1520
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,080
and not everything?

1521
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,080
And the simplest answer is

1522
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,080
that the universe is simply everything.

1523
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,080
That means that the universe

1524
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,080
is possibly used by all machines.

1525
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,080
How does it look exactly?

1526
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,080
We can take one more step

1527
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,080
before the Turing machine.

1528
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,080
The Turing machine

1529
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,080
that we normally use,

1530
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,080
this tape with the one head reader,

1531
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,080
is a way to talk about

1532
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,080
the calculation.

1533
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,080
And it has an interesting feature,

1534
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,080
it has an exact sequence state

1535
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,080
for every starting state.

1536
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,080
And this sequence state

1537
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,080
is deterministic,

1538
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,080
that means there is no coincidence,

1539
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,080
but when the same starting state is

1540
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,080
exactly in the same sequence state.

1541
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,080
The difference between deterministic

1542
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,080
and non-deterministic functions

1543
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,080
from this point of view would be

1544
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,080
that a non-deterministic function

1545
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,080
that can give a different result every time,

1546
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,080
would be a deterministic function

1547
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
every time under the same conditions

1548
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,080
that gives the same result.

1549
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,080
And the other feature

1550
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,080
besides the determinism of the Turing machine

1551
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,080
is that it is linear.

1552
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,080
That means that every state

1553
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,080
has a different function.

1554
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,080
But I could also define it differently.

1555
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,080
I could make one that is stochastic,

1556
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,080
that happens to go into one of several

1557
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,080
whether it is linear or non-linear.

1558
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,080
But you need coincidence.

1559
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Yes, but the coincidence only means

1560
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,080
that I have to define a function

1561
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,080
that gives me a different result every time.

1562
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,080
And that means that it cannot be

1563
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,080
compressed over time,

1564
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,080
but it is different every time,

1565
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,080
and you can do that,

1566
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,080
it just gets very long.

1567
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,080
I could also make it branched.

1568
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,080
If I make a Turing machine

1569
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,080
that does not have one subsequent state,

1570
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,080
but has several subsequent states,

1571
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,080
then it will have more branches

1572
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,080
in every state, so to speak.

1573
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,080
And that is, in the mathematical sense,

1574
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,080
a non-deterministic Turing machine.

1575
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,080
That is one that is not so defined

1576
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,080
that I only have one subsequent state,

1577
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,080
but is less constrained.

1578
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,080
That means it can go into several,

1579
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,080
because you can't only decide for one.

1580
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,080
It's a bit of an unhappy label,

1581
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,080
because non-deterministic sounds

1582
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,080
a bit esoteric as if it's a real coincidence,

1583
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,080
but you can't define it at all,

1584
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,080
observe, formalize.

1585
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,080
Yes, we can define the real coincidence

1586
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,080
by simply saying that our function

1587
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,080
must or can give us a different value every time.

1588
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,080
But I don't quite understand that,

1589
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,080
because the real coincidence

1590
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,080
is the problem that you have to get

1591
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,080
something out of nothing.

1592
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,080
No, you don't have to.

1593
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,080
There is, for example,

1594
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,080
if you want to decode things,

1595
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,080
the problem is that you can

1596
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,080
get the key out

1597
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,080
with mathematical operations,

1598
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,080
which regularity you have

1599
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,080
executed in mathematics,

1600
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,080
to connect the key

1601
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,080
with the text,

1602
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,080
so that you get the result.

1603
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,080
But there is a trick with which

1604
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,080
you can get the key out,

1605
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,080
and that is the one-time-pad.

1606
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,080
The one-time-pad uses a key

1607
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,080
that is just as long as the text you want to decode.

1608
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,080
And you exchange it

1609
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,080
so that you only use it once.

1610
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,080
That means you meet

1611
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,080
with your secret agent at the beginning,

1612
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,080
and you both use a key

1613
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,080
that you generate in such a way

1614
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,080
that no one else can know,

1615
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,080
and it's only used once.

1616
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,080
And each of you has a copy of this key.

1617
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,080
And you calculate this key

1618
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,080
together with your text every time.

1619
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,080
And everything you used,

1620
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,080
you throw away and burn it.

1621
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,080
And you always know exactly

1622
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,080
where you are on your blog,

1623
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,080
where you have this long key on it.

1624
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,080
And because this function

1625
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,080
is not known to anyone else,

1626
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,080
so you interact with the other universe

1627
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,080
until you let it interact,

1628
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,080
this function, from the point of view

1629
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,080
of every observer, is absolutely random.

1630
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,080
Okay, yes, of course, from the point of view

1631
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,080
of every observer anyway,

1632
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,080
who often solve themselves

1633
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,080
and think that basically

1634
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,080
in the substrate universe

1635
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,080
there are undetermined things

1636
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,080
and there you don't need anything.

1637
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,080
Yes, but that just means

1638
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,080
in practice there is a bubble

1639
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,080
that is hermetically separated

1640
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,080
from the rest of the universe

1641
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,080
and is exactly the same format.

1642
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,080
There is no difference.

1643
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,080
If we formalize this in a language,

1644
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,080
it is by chance nothing else

1645
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,080
than a source that was

1646
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,080
nothing in connection with the universe

1647
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,080
and there are values that have not been known to you.

1648
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,080
Okay, I'll buy one.

1649
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,080
So in this respect this is not a problem.

1650
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,080
But the non-deterministic Turing machine

1651
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,080
was chosen for another reason,

1652
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,080
because it is deterministic.

1653
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,080
That is, if I have a machine

1654
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,080
that goes into several states at the same time,

1655
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,080
that goes in parallel,

1656
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,080
there is no coincidence in it,

1657
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,080
but it just goes into all these states.

1658
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,080
The non-determinism comes about

1659
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,080
by the fact that when I am calculated

1660
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,080
in the Turing machine,

1661
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,080
I do not know in which branch I am.

1662
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,080
Copies of me are in all other branches,

1663
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,080
but there is no criterion

1664
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,080
that tells me in which branch I go in,

1665
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,080
because these branches

1666
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,080
just all exist in parallel.

1667
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,080
They are not somehow privileged from each other.

1668
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,080
That is, it is not the case that

1669
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,080
one is calculated more than the other

1670
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,080
or has any properties that

1671
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,080
differ from the others,

1672
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,080
which you can check by looking at the others,

1673
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,080
because the branches do not see each other

1674
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,080
The thing that is a coincidence,

1675
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,080
so to speak, only affects you

1676
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,080
if you are the observer

1677
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,080
who is calculated by the machine.

1678
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,080
As a student, I got to know this

1679
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,080
non-deterministic Turing machine

1680
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,080
as an undergrad,

1681
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,080
in basic studies,

1682
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,080
in complexity theory,

1683
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,080
as a method to measure

1684
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,080
how the complexity of algorithms is.

1685
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,080
I saw this as unimportant,

1686
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,080
because I can emulate this

1687
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,080
non-deterministic Turing machine

1688
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,080
by simply giving the normal Turing machine

1689
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,080
a stack, and every time

1690
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,080
I do a branch,

1691
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,080
I add the condition to the stack,

1692
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,080
and later I go back to this point

1693
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,080
and then have to calculate

1694
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,080
the branch in the other direction.

1695
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,080
This makes it completely equivalent.

1696
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,080
The disadvantage is that

1697
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,080
this non-deterministic Turing machine

1698
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,080
of course needs more memory.

1699
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,080
I have to calculate the stack

1700
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,080
and need more calculation steps.

1701
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080
And vice versa,

1702
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,080
it is also equivalent.

1703
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,080
I can calculate the non-deterministic Turing machine

1704
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,080
by simply ensuring

1705
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,080
that there is only one path

1706
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,080
that I look at.

1707
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,080
This is a real amount,

1708
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,080
and they are

1709
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,080
at a certain point

1710
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,080
equivalent,

1711
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,080
if I take into account that

1712
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,080
one needs more memory

1713
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,080
and calculation time than the other.

1714
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,080
But there are practical differences.

1715
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,080
For example, I imagine

1716
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,080
that our brain

1717
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,080
is not a Turing machine,

1718
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,080
but the individual neuron

1719
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,080
does not go through

1720
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,080
100% determinism in the next state

1721
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,080
when its environment is in this and that state,

1722
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,080
but it goes through a certain

1723
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,080
probability in that state.

1724
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,080
This means that if I have

1725
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,080
a population of neurons next to each other

1726
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,080
that have about the same environment

1727
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,080
and have a certain amount of coincidence,

1728
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,080
then they behave

1729
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,080
similarly to a non-deterministic Turing machine.

1730
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,080
That is, they are not so constrained

1731
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,080
that they only go down one path,

1732
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,080
but they sample a whole state space.

1733
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,080
They not only do one function,

1734
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,080
but they calculate several variants

1735
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,080
of this function at the same time.

1736
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,080
The substrate, of course,

1737
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,080
has a limited resolution,

1738
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,080
that is, the paths interact with each other

1739
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,080
and this leads to the fact that

1740
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,080
these states can collapse,

1741
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,080
the neurons can finally vote

1742
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,080
on the result.

1743
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,080
But the interesting thing is that our brain

1744
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,080
and our reasoning processes,

1745
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,080
which our mind runs through,

1746
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,080
have to be described in such a way that we do not

1747
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,080
go through a sequence of states step by step,

1748
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,080
but that we at the same time go through

1749
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,080
a space of possible states in parallel.

1750
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,080
And this space then votes with each other

1751
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,080
and collapses again.

1752
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,080
And if we try to go backwards through our thoughts,

1753
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,080
we do not know in what states we have been,

1754
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,080
because all these paths

1755
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,080
have no traces left.

1756
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,080
Nobody has noticed in what states we have all been.

1757
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,080
And we can reconstruct a path,

1758
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,080
that is, if we model our brain

1759
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,080
as a stochastic,

1760
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,080
non-deterministic Turing machine

1761
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,080
with a limited substrate resolution,

1762
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,080
we have a slightly different paradigm

1763
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,080
than a deterministic Turing machine

1764
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,080
that is calculated on a von Neumann computer.

1765
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,080
Even if it would still be implementable on it?

1766
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,080
Yes, it is still implementable on it, exactly.

1767
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,080
This leads to confusion

1768
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,080
in some philosophers,

1769
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,080
for example the integrated information theory,

1770
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,080
which is the consciousness theory

1771
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,080
of Tononi and his students.

1772
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,080
Philosophers believe in something like this.

1773
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,080
Tononi says that

1774
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,080
he can imagine

1775
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,080
that you can build a neuromorphic computer,

1776
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,080
one that behaves similarly,

1777
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,080
even if it is built artificially,

1778
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,080
like the distributed processes

1779
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,080
of the information calculation of our brain,

1780
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,080
that it can be conscious.

1781
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,080
That it says, I feel, so I have consciousness.

1782
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,080
But a von Neumann computer,

1783
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,080
the one we have implemented

1784
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,080
as a digital computer,

1785
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,080
which works sequentially, does not.

1786
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,080
And this leads to a problem,

1787
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,080
namely that

1788
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,080
we can,

1789
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,080
through the Turing thesis,

1790
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,080
which Tononi does not agree on,

1791
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,080
prove that we can

1792
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,080
emulate the neuromorphic computer

1793
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,080
on the sequential computer.

1794
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,080
That means we can build a computer

1795
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,080
on the von Neumann computer

1796
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,080
that behaves exactly like the neuromorphic computer.

1797
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,080
They are completely equivalent.

1798
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,080
And that means that it also says,

1799
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,080
I feel, so I am.

1800
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,080
In any case, it is a lie,

1801
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:43,080
because it cannot feel anything

1802
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,080
in the way it is conscious.

1803
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,080
And that leads to the problem

1804
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,080
that consciousness would be an epiphenomenon.

1805
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,080
That is, that our statements,

1806
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,080
that we are conscious,

1807
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,080
are not caused by consciousness itself,

1808
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,080
but we move our mouth mechanically by chance

1809
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,080
as if it were caused by consciousness,

1810
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,080
but it is not.

1811
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,080
Consciousness, so to speak,

1812
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,080
quietly on the side and observes

1813
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,080
our physical realities in our mind,

1814
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,080
which some people say, I have no consciousness,

1815
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,080
others say, I have a consciousness,

1816
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,080
and it cannot influence it somehow.

1817
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,080
And epiphenomenonism is therefore

1818
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,080
not a good theory,

1819
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,080
because epiphenomenonists are not epiphenomenonists,

1820
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,080
so they say, my consciousness

1821
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,080
will not be physically effective,

1822
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,080
because they have consciousness.

1823
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,080
Consciousness does not cause epiphenomenonism.

1824
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,080
The mouth movements of epiphenomenonist

1825
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,080
philosophers are not caused by his consciousness.

1826
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,080
And that is a very stupid theory,

1827
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,080
which is why Tononi would not sign.

1828
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,080
And that means, however,

1829
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,080
that the integrated information theory,

1830
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,080
if you have it in such a form,

1831
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,080
as Tononi has it,

1832
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,080
leads to a completely insolvent contradiction.

1833
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,080
If you dissolve it, then only

1834
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,080
global workspace theory remains.

1835
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,080
But this is not a real theory,

1836
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,080
but a framework, actually.

1837
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,080
It is more of a framework.

1838
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,080
But it does not explain functionally

1839
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,080
how it comes to such states.

1840
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,080
But that's what it means for me as a computer scientist,

1841
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,080
I look at it with a certain indifference

1842
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,080
and do not quite understand how you can do that.

1843
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,080
For me, this is more of a control group,

1844
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,080
a theory that has such an obvious logical contradiction

1845
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,080
that a computer scientist in elementary school

1846
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,080
recognizes that. How can you represent that?

1847
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,080
So we have existence and non-existence at the same time.

1848
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,080
And we are now in the second phase of existence.

1849
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,080
And the simplest form of this

1850
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,080
existing phase is

1851
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,080
that we apply all operators

1852
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,080
in parallel.

1853
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,080
And this means that the universe simply

1854
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,080
branches, in every step,

1855
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,080
maximum branching,

1856
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,080
because there is no selection function

1857
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,080
for the operators. That means

1858
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,080
that all operators are simply applied.

1859
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,080
And an operator is a function

1860
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,080
that takes a pattern from noticeable differences

1861
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,080
and converts it into another

1862
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,080
pattern from noticeable differences.

1863
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,080
And all operators are simply

1864
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,080
applied, and some of these operators

1865
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,080
are very often applied, because they are

1866
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,080
simple and often, and others are very rare.

1867
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,080
And this leads to an interesting concept

1868
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,080
of identity, because

1869
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,080
there is no one.

1870
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,080
What exists now is, for example, that

1871
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,080
the photon would be, in this way,

1872
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,080
an operator,

1873
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,080
which always takes place

1874
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,080
when there is an environment on which this operator

1875
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,080
fits. So if, so to speak,

1876
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,080
there is a photon-shaped hole in the universe,

1877
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,080
then this photon operator is used

1878
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,080
and shifts the environment

1879
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,080
so that

1880
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,080
the same hole is created,

1881
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,080
plus a little bit further away.

1882
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,080
And this way this photon operator

1883
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,080
fits again in the next step.

1884
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,080
That is, this is a sequence of

1885
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,080
related operators

1886
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,080
that can be applied one by one,

1887
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,080
which leads to the fact that a pattern

1888
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,080
continues in the space,

1889
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,080
just like the glider in Game of Life.

1890
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,080
With the difference that the space is not

1891
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,080
given at all, regardless of the patterns,

1892
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,080
but the space first arises by

1893
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,080
the fact that I collect certain noticeable

1894
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,080
differences in such a way that a

1895
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,080
pattern is created that can be described as a space.

1896
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,080
That is, the photon is an operator

1897
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,080
or a sequence of operator

1898
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,080
applications that lead to

1899
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,080
that first a regularity is created

1900
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,080
in which information can

1901
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,080
spread and interact with

1902
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,080
other information.

1903
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,080
And that just results

1904
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,080
by the fact that these operators

1905
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,080
are possible.

1906
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,080
And again to translate,

1907
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,080
the base level reality,

1908
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,080
that is, the lowest level of reality,

1909
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,080
has nothing that goes ahead of it.

1910
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,080
That is practically the definition of base level reality.

1911
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,080
Every other reality that goes ahead

1912
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,080
is practically a kind of simulation reality

1913
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,080
where in the

1914
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,080
parents' universe a computer

1915
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,080
stands in some form

1916
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,080
on which this underlying reality

1917
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,080
runs. And the physicalism

1918
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:43,080
is the idea that in our world

1919
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,080
there is a mechanical amount of rules,

1920
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,080
so not some refined

1921
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,080
computer program in which

1922
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,080
a programmer can intervene at any time,

1923
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,080
but simply

1924
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,080
a causally closed

1925
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,080
amount of simple rules

1926
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,080
from which everything emerges.

1927
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,080
And that we are already in this base reality.

1928
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,080
And the idea that is here

1929
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,080
is that this base level

1930
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,080
reality, because it has no priors,

1931
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,080
nothing that goes ahead of it,

1932
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,080
can be described

1933
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,080
as simply everything that is possible

1934
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,080
exists in it. And that

1935
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,080
we exist in the space of all these

1936
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,080
possibilities.

1937
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,080
And the universe is a

1938
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,080
tautology, so mathematically

1939
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,080
tautology is something that exists

1940
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,080
without conditions, for example A is equal to A

1941
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,080
exists through the axiom of identity

1942
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,080
in classical logic.

1943
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,080
And that means that nothing new is said,

1944
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,080
but it just results

1945
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,080
from the assumption of these rules

1946
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,080
as if there are no conditions.

1947
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,080
Tautology are all these conditions

1948
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,080
where nothing new is said.

1949
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,080
And it can be described

1950
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,080
as a non-deterministic

1951
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,080
Turing machine,

1952
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,080
so this machine that branches,

1953
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,080
in this case in all branches,

1954
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,080
and with all

1955
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,080
Kolmogorov complexity of zero.

1956
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,080
And Kolmogorov complexity

1957
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,080
describes how complicated the algorithm

1958
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,080
is.

1959
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,080
Kolmogorov had the idea

1960
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,080
that you can describe for different computer programs

1961
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,080
or for different

1962
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,080
functions how complicated they are.

1963
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,080
By this, how long

1964
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,080
is the program that you need

1965
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,080
to define this function?

1966
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,080
If you, like

1967
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,080
Stephen Wolfram, try to find a function

1968
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,080
from which our universe emerges,

1969
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,080
then this function has

1970
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,080
no length of zero, but it is an

1971
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,080
automatic machine that needs a certain

1972
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,080
number of steps to write it down

1973
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,080
and a certain number of bits

1974
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,080
to write it down.

1975
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,080
And that would be the number of bits

1976
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,080
that you need to write down an algorithm,

1977
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,080
that would be the Kolmogorov complexity.

1978
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,080
There is a problem

1979
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,080
with Kolmogorov complexity.

1980
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,080
When I write down the different computer languages,

1981
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,080
they are different in length, depending on the language.

1982
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,080
In practice, the problem is not that big,

1983
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,080
because I can often

1984
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:59,080
translate into these languages,

1985
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,080
and this translation program is not very long,

1986
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,080
so that I have a pretty good idea of what

1987
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,080
the shortest is.

1988
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,080
There are limits

1989
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,080
where it is difficult, but in practice

1990
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,080
the problem is not that big.

1991
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,080
The Solomonov induction has similar problems.

1992
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,080
Exactly.

1993
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,080
The Solomonov induction basically describes

1994
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,080
what a modeling system does.

1995
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,080
For example, our mind,

1996
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,080
Ray Solomonov had the idea

1997
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,080
to systematize it

1998
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,080
through a kind of Kolmogorov complexity.

1999
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,080
He says that

2000
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,080
what a mind does at the end of the day is that

2001
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,080
it tries to predict the present

2002
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,080
from the previous observations

2003
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,080
through the shortest possible program,

2004
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,080
that is, with the shortest possible Kolmogorov complexity.

2005
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,080
For all pairs of current and

2006
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:43,080
previous observations.

2007
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,080
What I just said informally

2008
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,080
is very nice to write down formally.

2009
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,080
With this, you have a specification

2010
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,080
for a universal modeling system,

2011
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,080
which has the disadvantage

2012
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,080
that it is so general

2013
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,080
that you can't calculate it yet.

2014
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,080
That means you have to find something

2015
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,080
in practice that somehow

2016
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,080
brings the Solomonov induction closer.

2017
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,080
But back to the Kolmogorov complexity,

2018
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,080
if we are in the base-level reality,

2019
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,080
then there is no program

2020
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,080
that is below this base-level reality.

2021
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,080
That means it has to be in tautology.

2022
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,080
That means the Kolmogorov complexity

2023
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,080
of our universe should be zero.

2024
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,080
That means a program of length zero.

2025
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,080
And the easiest program of length zero,

2026
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,080
if you do not assume

2027
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,080
that length zero is nothing,

2028
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,080
but all possibilities,

2029
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,080
is simply applied to all operators.

2030
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,080
And that means every operator is applied

2031
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,080
wherever it fits.

2032
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,080
There is always an operator

2033
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,080
that fits in our world relatively often,

2034
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,080
because there are many photon-shaped holes,

2035
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,080
because the photon is relatively simple.

2036
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,080
But you and I, we are operators

2037
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,080
that are very rare, that are very rarely used,

2038
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,080
because we need a relatively complex

2039
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,080
environment to exist.

2040
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,080
And that means we only appear

2041
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,080
very, very rarely in our universe.

2042
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,080
And then there are

2043
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,080
some operators

2044
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,080
that can only appear once,

2045
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,080
namely on the one hand the Highlander.

2046
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,080
You can only enter one of them,

2047
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,080
it is defined like this.

2048
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,080
And then the universe itself,

2049
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:11,080
the entirety of all possibilities that exist.

2050
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,080
And Stephen Wolfram calls it the Rolyard.

2051
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,080
That is the thing that occurs

2052
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,080
because you apply all operators

2053
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,080
unlimitedly to each other.

2054
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,080
Can you repeat the name

2055
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,080
in English?

2056
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:25,080
The entangled limit of everything.

2057
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,080
The entangled limit of all possible computations.

2058
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,080
But say it in English.

2059
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,080
The entangled limit of all possible computations.

2060
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,080
I don't like it that much,

2061
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,080
because there are so many terms in there

2062
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,080
that you have to explain first.

2063
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,080
For example, what does entangled mean at the point?

2064
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,080
And what is meant by that?

2065
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,080
That they all hang together on one big thing.

2066
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,080
That there is a path

2067
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,080
in every direction, in every direction.

2068
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,080
And limit means in the case that

2069
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,080
it is actually unlimited.

2070
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,080
In some places it is not unlimited.

2071
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,080
Locally it is often the case

2072
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,080
that when I have this Turing machine

2073
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,080
and I have a branch,

2074
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,080
then I don't always get

2075
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,080
unlimited different states,

2076
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,080
but sometimes the pattern is created by itself.

2077
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,080
That means the branches meet

2078
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,080
in a certain way by

2079
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,080
creating the same patterns

2080
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,080
on different paths.

2081
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,080
That does not mean that they physically meet

2082
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,080
and collide again,

2083
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,080
but that when I try to write down

2084
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,080
this calculation or to model from the outside,

2085
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,080
that I often don't have so many different states

2086
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,080
in which it goes,

2087
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,080
and that means, for example,

2088
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,080
that when I describe the particle,

2089
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,080
then it is so that the individual particle

2090
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,080
is often defined in such a way

2091
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,080
that there is not only a possibility

2092
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,080
in which it can exist, but there are many paths

2093
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,080
that it can take, but many paths

2094
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,080
then meet again. And where they meet,

2095
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,080
there is again a convergence.

2096
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,080
And this convergence leads to

2097
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,080
that a part of the universe can predict

2098
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,080
what another part of the universe will do.

2099
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,080
And that is the prerequisite

2100
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,080
for the creation of structure.

2101
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,080
The structure of the universe is created

2102
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,080
by the fact that there is control.

2103
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,080
That is, a part of the universe can predict

2104
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,080
what another part of the universe can do

2105
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,080
and this part of the universe

2106
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,080
can adjust to the other

2107
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,080
and thus produce the local,

2108
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,080
more stable structures.

2109
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,080
And in a place where this does not happen,

2110
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,080
there is no interaction and therefore no control.

2111
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,080
And that means that there is then

2112
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,080
no interesting structure,

2113
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,080
but these are just random fluctuations.

2114
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:23,080
And what you would expect

2115
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,080
is that you find a lowest level

2116
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,080
in which there are very, very many

2117
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,080
random fluctuations,

2118
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,080
which lead to nothing,

2119
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,080
which are therefore not predictable

2120
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,080
and are created by the fact that you do not know

2121
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,080
in which path you end.

2122
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,080
All paths are going at the same time,

2123
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,080
you are always on a certain path of them

2124
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,080
and in your path,

2125
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,080
which splits up all the time,

2126
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,080
that is, every bit in your universe

2127
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,080
changes in a random way all the time,

2128
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,080
there are these whole splinters

2129
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,080
and most of these splinters

2130
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,080
do nothing and sometimes

2131
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,080
they swing up to a structure

2132
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,080
and this structure gets bigger and bigger

2133
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,080
depending on how strong

2134
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,080
it leads to control processes.

2135
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,080
And on the simplest level,

2136
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,080
the control processes that occur

2137
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,080
are particles that lead

2138
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,080
to something like a space

2139
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,080
being created in which

2140
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,080
the particles can be assigned a momentum.

2141
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,080
The momentum is the direction

2142
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,080
from which the particles come

2143
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,080
and the space is addressable,

2144
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:23,080
that is, you can adjust to it,

2145
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,080
what comes from this direction?

2146
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:27,080
And these structures lead to

2147
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,080
that these particles,

2148
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,080
something like elemental particles,

2149
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,080
form, that is, swirls that arise from these particles

2150
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,080
that become stable and these swirls

2151
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,080
can then, I can try mathematically

2152
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,080
to guide which swirls are technically possible

2153
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,080
because I apply such functions

2154
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,080
to each other and at some point

2155
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,080
such swirls arise from swirls

2156
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,080
and these are the atoms

2157
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,080
and there is a whole zoo

2158
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,080
of such atoms that are stable

2159
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,080
under these conditions.

2160
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,080
And this zoo of atoms,

2161
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,080
the physics has not yet figured out

2162
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,080
how they can all guide them.

2163
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,080
But the suspicion is that

2164
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,080
there is a possibility, ultimately from the theory of numbers,

2165
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,080
to guide the periodic table of elements

2166
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,080
and to think about which things

2167
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,080
are stable under which conditions

2168
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,080
for how long and in which spaces,

2169
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,080
how high-dimensional they are.

2170
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,080
And what stands out, for example, is

2171
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,080
that most things are only stable

2172
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,080
in the three-dimensional space.

2173
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,080
That is, the electromagnetism,

2174
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,080
the forces with which

2175
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,080
the atoms interact,

2176
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,080
are ultimately all in this three-dimensional space.

2177
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,080
So the photons and neutrinos

2178
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,080
and so on are generations

2179
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,080
of the same particle classes.

2180
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,080
They all find themselves in

2181
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,080
such a confined three-dimensional space

2182
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,080
in which we are.

2183
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,080
And the strong force and the weak force

2184
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,080
are only within the atomic nucleus

2185
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,080
and do not affect each other

2186
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,080
over such a long distance.

2187
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,080
Possibly this is due to the fact that

2188
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,080
they form whirlpools in higher spaces

2189
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,080
than in three-dimensional spaces.

2190
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,080
And mathematically you can show that

2191
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,080
rotation, so to speak,

2192
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,080
is possible in two dimensions,

2193
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,080
and in four dimensions,

2194
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,080
and in eight dimensions.

2195
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,080
But not more in sixteen dimensions.

2196
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,080
They get a little more complicated every time.

2197
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,080
And if you think about

2198
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:11,080
what a whirlpool formation actually is,

2199
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,080
for example, imagine

2200
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,080
that you are in a bathtub

2201
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,080
and you move your hand and observe

2202
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,080
the whirlpools that form

2203
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,080
on the surface of the bathtub,

2204
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,080
most of these waves

2205
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:25,080
disappear after a short time

2206
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,080
in the background.

2207
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,080
And the ones that are stable, so to speak,

2208
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,080
are round whirlpools that remain

2209
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,080
and that, like particles,

2210
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,080
pull along the surface of the bathtub

2211
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,080
as long as they either

2212
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,080
go into other whirlpools

2213
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,080
or disappear by friction,

2214
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,080
or by interacting

2215
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,080
with other things,

2216
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,080
for example your hand

2217
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,080
or something like that.

2218
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,080
But for themselves they are stable.

2219
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,080
This is due to the fact that

2220
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,080
they rotate exactly into themselves.

2221
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,080
That is, that they have an exact angle

2222
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,080
in their momentum,

2223
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,080
that the information remains constant

2224
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,080
in the volume and does not disappear

2225
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,080
from this volume, that is,

2226
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,080
flows out into the room.

2227
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,080
For example, if I look at rotation

2228
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,080
in some discrete vector spaces

2229
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,080
or something like that,

2230
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,080
is that the mathematical formalization

2231
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,080
of these whirlpools?

2232
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,080
Yes, so if you think about it,

2233
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,080
what is a rotation?

2234
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,080
It is an operation for 2D,

2235
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,080
a vector operation in a

2236
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,080
two-dimensional space.

2237
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,080
If we think about it,

2238
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:31,080
what do dimensions actually mean?

2239
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:33,080
We get the first dimension

2240
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,080
by taking our whole numbers

2241
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,080
in the whirlpooling scheme

2242
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,080
as a kind of number stream.

2243
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:41,080
We had found that

2244
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,080
processes and sequences are sufficient

2245
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:45,080
to move around on a number stream

2246
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:47,080
when it is ordered.

2247
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,080
And then we can use additions

2248
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,080
to teleport and zoom with multiplication.

2249
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:53,080
And the same thing works

2250
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,080
with two-dimensional numbers.

2251
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,080
Two-dimensional numbers are created

2252
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:59,080
by taking our number stream

2253
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,080
and folding it, for example.

2254
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,080
In the computer you can create

2255
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,080
the one-dimensional address space

2256
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,080
where every memory cell

2257
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,080
in the computer gets an address.

2258
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,080
From which I can determine the process

2259
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,080
like on a Turing machine

2260
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,080
where one cell moves forward and backward.

2261
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,080
You can also simply say,

2262
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,080
I'm going 100 steps forward

2263
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,080
and I get to the next cell of my array.

2264
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,080
And this simple operation,

2265
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,080
right and left, I do plus or minus 1

2266
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,080
and up and down I do plus or minus 100.

2267
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,080
This way I have a possibility

2268
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,080
to fold my number stream in the computer

2269
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,080
into a lattice.

2270
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,080
And this lattice

2271
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,080
is a simple way to make it two-dimensional.

2272
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,080
There are many possibilities.

2273
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,080
I can do this as a spiral,

2274
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,080
then I have something like polar coordinates.

2275
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,080
Or as a Hilbert curve

2276
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,080
that fills space.

2277
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,080
And there are many tricks

2278
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,080
with which you can fill the space

2279
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,080
in such a way that you always get

2280
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,080
smaller 8-core points

2281
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,080
and get such an unboundedness.

2282
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,080
And in this two-dimensional number space

2283
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:01,080
that I can calculate all together,

2284
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,080
these two-dimensional lattice,

2285
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,080
I can define a rotation

2286
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,080
as an additional operation.

2287
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,080
So first of all I can do two-dimensional addition.

2288
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:11,080
That means I teleport

2289
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,080
into two dimensions.

2290
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,080
I can also zoom into two dimensions

2291
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,080
by multiplying my vector,

2292
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,080
my coordinate pair

2293
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,080
with a one-dimensional number.

2294
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,080
I zoom in and out.

2295
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,080
But I can also rotate

2296
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,080
by using the second coordinate

2297
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,080
by multiplying with the complex number.

2298
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,080
Rotating leads to

2299
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,080
that I can build a structure

2300
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,080
that remains constant

2301
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,080
even though I move it

2302
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,080
away from the dimension.

2303
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,080
In the simplest case I rotate

2304
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:45,080
it by 90 degrees.

2305
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,080
And I can also rotate it

2306
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,080
in parts of 90 degrees

2307
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,080
if I manage to define a function

2308
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,080
with which I can make the intervals smaller.

2309
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,080
And the function

2310
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,080
with which I can keep a structure constant

2311
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,080
even though I make the intervals smaller

2312
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,080
is a rotation.

2313
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:03,080
A kind of continuous permutation.

2314
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,080
And if I want to keep a dynamic structure

2315
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,080
constant,

2316
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,080
so that the information does not dissipate

2317
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,080
under information maintenance conditions,

2318
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,080
then it has to be a kind of rotation.

2319
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,080
Something where the information

2320
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,080
rotates back in itself.

2321
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,080
And such rotations,

2322
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:23,080
the easiest ones, are a multiplication

2323
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,080
with a complex number, with a two-dimensional number.

2324
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,080
And the thing is that

2325
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,080
in two dimensions

2326
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,080
this works, but in three dimensions

2327
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:33,080
I can only

2328
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,080
perform two-dimensional rotations,

2329
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,080
not three-dimensional.

2330
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,080
If you think about it, if we rotate something in 3D,

2331
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,080
then it's always about an axis in a plane.

2332
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,080
This is because in 3D

2333
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,080
there are no complex numbers,

2334
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:49,080
like an i,

2335
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,080
in complex numbers there are no

2336
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,080
i and j,

2337
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,080
which have this property

2338
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,080
that you can define multiplications

2339
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,080
that lead to a constant

2340
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,080
of the pattern.

2341
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:03,080
This means that all three-dimensional rotations

2342
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:05,080
are two-dimensional.

2343
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,080
We only use a subset

2344
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,080
of the three dimensions.

2345
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,080
There is always a certain exception to this.

2346
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,080
For example smoke rings.

2347
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,080
A smoke ring is a torus

2348
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,080
that rotates around a circle.

2349
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,080
And this works

2350
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:21,080
because you can compress the air.

2351
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,080
In order for the torus to rotate,

2352
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:25,080
you have to compress the air

2353
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,080
on the inside of the smoke ring

2354
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:29,080
while it turns inside and

2355
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:31,080
extends outwards.

2356
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,080
This works because the air is elastic.

2357
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,080
That's why you can blow

2358
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,080
air rings underwater.

2359
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,080
Many people do it for fun,

2360
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,080
because the air is compressible.

2361
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,080
But you can't blow water rings underwater,

2362
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,080
because the water is not compressible.

2363
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,080
The compressibility of the air

2364
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:49,080
means that the space is crumpled.

2365
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,080
It is weakly four-dimensional.

2366
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,080
This smoke ring is a rotation

2367
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,080
that is only possible in three-dimensional space,

2368
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,080
because the three-dimensional space

2369
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,080
has a little more than three dimensions

2370
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,080
if you can compress it.

2371
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,080
In four dimensions,

2372
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,080
I can define new rotations.

2373
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,080
For example, I can take a ball

2374
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,080
and rotate it around itself

2375
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:13,080
so that the inside turns outwards.

2376
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,080
This is not possible in three-dimensional space,

2377
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,080
because the surface will overlap with itself.

2378
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,080
But in four-dimensional space,

2379
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,080
I have an additional dimension.

2380
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,080
That means I have a rotation

2381
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,080
where I rotate 360 degrees,

2382
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:27,080
but it is not as precise as before.

2383
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,080
I tried to rotate a circle,

2384
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,080
but I have to rotate 360 degrees

2385
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,080
another time

2386
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,080
so that I get back to my starting point.

2387
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,080
So I rotate 720 degrees

2388
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,080
so that I get around it.

2389
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,080
Interestingly,

2390
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,080
in music there are rotations

2391
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,080
where you have to rotate 360 degrees

2392
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,080
so that you get back to your starting point.

2393
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,080
These are spinors.

2394
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,080
It is really cool

2395
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,080
that you can get into mathematics

2396
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,080
and derive from the theory of numbers

2397
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,080
what rotations are possible.

2398
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,080
The cool thing is that these spinor spaces

2399
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,080
are the algebras in which rotations are possible.

2400
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,080
That is the Fredkin thing, isn't it?

2401
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,080
I don't think Fredkin discovered it.

2402
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,080
I don't know who discovered it first.

2403
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,080
I can't give a reference,

2404
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:11,080
but a friend of mine

2405
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,080
gave me a series of texts.

2406
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,080
Unfortunately, I lost the source.

2407
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,080
You have to ask who it was.

2408
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,080
It is that you can derive

2409
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:21,080
the rotations from the theory of numbers

2410
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:23,080
and create the reference to quantum mechanics.

2411
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,080
What I find interesting

2412
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,080
philosophically and genealogically

2413
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:29,080
is that with methods

2414
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,080
of natural sciences

2415
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:33,080
or computer science

2416
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,080
in the end,

2417
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,080
you define it as a new

2418
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,080
rationalist program of philosophy.

2419
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,080
Of course.

2420
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,080
And I find that funny

2421
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,080
that rationalism

2422
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:47,080
finds the way back

2423
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:49,080
into philosophy

2424
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,080
via stem or something like that.

2425
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:53,080
That is a nice way back.

2426
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:55,080
I would express it a little differently.

2427
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:57,080
In my opinion,

2428
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:59,080
we have a number of

2429
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,080
philosophical fundamental questions.

2430
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,080
The famous four questions of philosophy.

2431
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,080
What is going on?

2432
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,080
Why does this happen to me?

2433
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,080
What should I do?

2434
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,080
That is the ethics.

2435
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,080
And what can I know?

2436
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,080
Epistemology,

2437
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,080
ontology,

2438
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,080
ethics and metaphysics.

2439
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,080
These questions can be put

2440
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,080
by computationalism

2441
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,080
on a common basis.

2442
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,080
Computationalism is nothing

2443
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,080
other than the amount of all formal languages.

2444
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,080
And the subset is implementable.

2445
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:37,080
And after we have seen

2446
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,080
that some of the formal languages

2447
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,080
are not implementable,

2448
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,080
there are specifications

2449
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,080
such as the hairdresser

2450
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,080
who cuts the beard of all men

2451
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,080
who shave themselves,

2452
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:51,080
which leads to contradictions.

2453
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:53,080
We only cut out the languages

2454
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,080
that are implementable.

2455
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,080
And these are the computational languages.

2456
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:59,080
And after I realized that all these

2457
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,080
languages are also equally powerful,

2458
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,080
that I can represent each one

2459
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,080
through each other,

2460
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,080
if they are so powerful that I can build a computer with them,

2461
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:09,080
I have a system with which I can describe reality.

2462
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,080
Every possible language in which

2463
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:13,080
something can be represented,

2464
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,080
but also every language in which

2465
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,080
structural education is possible.

2466
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,080
And that allows me

2467
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,080
to unite

2468
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,080
the philosophy into a system.

2469
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,080
And of course I am not the first

2470
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,080
who has done this.

2471
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,080
But the interesting thing is that

2472
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,080
the longer I do this,

2473
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,080
the later the parties get.

2474
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,080
And what is fascinating for me

2475
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,080
is that I did not find out

2476
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,080
anything about it in my own studies.

2477
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:41,080
And I was very depressed

2478
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,080
that these things, these building blocks,

2479
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,080
were not put together in a way that was not recognizable to me.

2480
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,080
And I do not have the claim

2481
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:49,080
to say that this is a good alternative

2482
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:51,080
to what my philosophy teachers have done

2483
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,080
in my studies,

2484
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,080
but in the end I am just a guy

2485
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,080
who has existential questions

2486
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,080
and who has the same questions from other people

2487
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,080
as I do.

2488
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,080
And to form a system in which I can understand

2489
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,080
how thinking works

2490
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:07,080
and who we are, and how consciousness

2491
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:09,080
and language and representation

2492
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,080
can work, but also how existence

2493
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:13,080
can work. And all of this

2494
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,080
all fits together.

2495
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,080
In addition to the

2496
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,080
split

2497
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:23,080
by the non-deterministic Turing machine,

2498
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:25,080
on the one hand,

2499
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,080
because a lot of operators are used

2500
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:29,080
in every condition,

2501
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,080
we have a loss of information

2502
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,080
all the time.

2503
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,080
Because only the things that

2504
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,080
are controllable, that are controllable

2505
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:39,080
and stabilize, they stay.

2506
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,080
And all other things are just

2507
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,080
new to us

2508
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,080
or they disappear completely.

2509
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,080
Nevertheless, there are

2510
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,080
these branches.

2511
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,080
And that would mean that we accept

2512
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:55,080
something like a multiversum theory,

2513
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,080
unless we assume

2514
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,080
that it is only certain branches

2515
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,080
that are allowed to stabilize at all,

2516
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,080
right?

2517
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,080
That does not exclude both. The thing is

2518
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,080
that it is often the case that several branches

2519
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,080
are allowed to stabilize, but you still

2520
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,080
do not know which one you are.

2521
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:13,080
That means that you get a situation

2522
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,080
that you have a double split experiment

2523
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:17,080
and you do not know through which split

2524
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:19,080
the photon goes, because it goes

2525
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,080
through the whole split, but not

2526
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:23,080
through your path. In your path

2527
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,080
it only goes through one.

2528
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,080
And you do not know which path it is.

2529
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,080
As an observer who is embedded

2530
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:31,080
and coexists with this photon,

2531
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:33,080
you do not know if you are in the path

2532
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:35,080
where the photon goes through the right or left split.

2533
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:37,080
The only thing you can say is that

2534
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,080
if you look at millions of photons,

2535
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,080
then there will be the following statistical

2536
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:43,080
pattern about the interactions.

2537
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,080
And this statistical pattern

2538
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:47,080
you can say in advance. And the photon

2539
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,080
is also such a statistical pattern.

2540
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:51,080
That means that this is also a regularity

2541
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,080
that results in structures in the universe

2542
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,080
beginning to be so predictable

2543
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,080
for each other that they

2544
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,080
can stabilize.

2545
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,080
Okay, and how do I make sure

2546
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:03,080
that I'm always on the right path?

2547
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:05,080
Yes, I think

2548
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,080
that's a totally nice greeting

2549
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,080
that you can derive from it,

2550
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:11,080
that you say, do you always

2551
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,080
want to be in the best path

2552
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,080
in the multiverse?

2553
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:17,080
But the thing is that this multiverse

2554
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:19,080
does not, so to speak,

2555
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,080
arise from the fact that the physicists

2556
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:23,080
have gone wild and

2557
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:25,080
have connections in the world that

2558
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,080
you can not check and that

2559
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:29,080
you can never prove and then

2560
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:31,080
postulate all these additional paths,

2561
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:33,080
but that there is simply no possibility

2562
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,080
to determine a priori

2563
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,080
that there is only one path.

2564
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,080
And that in the basic reality it is probably not

2565
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:41,080
possible that there is only one path,

2566
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,080
because there is simply nothing that

2567
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:45,080
there is only one path.

2568
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:47,080
I used this thing

2569
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,080
where you use all operators on all operators

2570
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:51,080
to discuss with students

2571
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:53,080
who told me, yes, Wolfram

2572
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,080
just wrote an article

2573
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:57,080
about it, he has the same idea.

2574
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,080
And then I read it and

2575
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:01,080
realized, yes, that looks like the same idea.

2576
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,080
I also tried to understand

2577
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,080
myself with him.

2578
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,080
In the time when I worked at

2579
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,080
Interlabs, I held

2580
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,080
a number of panel discussions with

2581
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:13,080
people that I found interesting,

2582
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,080
which I then invited to discuss

2583
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,080
topics with us that interested us.

2584
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,080
And Steven Wolfram kindly

2585
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:21,080
agreed to it.

2586
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:23,080
And I tried to ask him

2587
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,080
questions about the boundaries of the role.

2588
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,080
But unfortunately

2589
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:29,080
he was not ready at the points

2590
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:31,080
where we did not know the answers

2591
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,080
to discuss further.

2592
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,080
I think he had to figure it out for himself first.

2593
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,080
If everything

2594
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:39,080
that is possible is simply the case,

2595
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:41,080
because if you do not have any

2596
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,080
prior, no bid

2597
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,080
to specify that

2598
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:47,080
the possible is not there,

2599
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:49,080
then people think very quickly, okay, then

2600
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,080
everything I can imagine is going to happen somewhere.

2601
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,080
And then we asked ourselves if it was the same as the cover.

2602
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,080
Because everything that is possible means

2603
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:57,080
that if you apply all operators

2604
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,080
that all structures that arise from it

2605
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,080
are the possible structures. But it can be very likely

2606
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,080
that you can imagine something incomplete,

2607
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:05,080
I don't know, if the unicorn

2608
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,080
flies through or something,

2609
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,080
which is still not realized.

2610
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:11,080
And I think that would be the difference to this multiversum,

2611
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,080
where then suddenly everything that is imaginable

2612
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,080
has to exist, because there is everything,

2613
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,080
versus, well, everything that

2614
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:19,080
arises from the repeated application of one operator

2615
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:21,080
on all rules is then there.

2616
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,080
But do you know the difference?

2617
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:25,080
Yes, of course, the thing is

2618
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,080
the Boltzmann universe, so to speak,

2619
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:29,080
the global state of the universe

2620
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:31,080
goes into another global state

2621
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:33,080
that is not correlated with the previous one.

2622
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,080
Yes, it is possible,

2623
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,080
but extremely unlikely,

2624
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,080
because it is an extremely complex

2625
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,080
operator, which is therefore

2626
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:43,080
very rare. And that means

2627
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:45,080
the probability that you are currently

2628
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,080
in the Boltzmann state is extremely

2629
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,080
low, because normally

2630
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,080
structured structures in the

2631
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,080
Boltzmann universe do not arise.

2632
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:55,080
And that means that the

2633
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,080
probability that you are practically in a sequential

2634
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,080
or operator sequence

2635
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,080
is much, much greater, because there are much more

2636
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,080
possibilities, more paths on which

2637
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:05,080
a universe that looks like ours

2638
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:07,080
arises. That means you can't exactly

2639
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,080
know where you are in this big fractal,

2640
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,080
that you create by the rules, that you just

2641
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,080
generate everything from one, all the time

2642
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:15,080
with all possibilities.

2643
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,080
It is the probability that you are

2644
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,080
in the thing that is created

2645
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,080
by the sequential operator application

2646
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,080
of simple operators

2647
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,080
is astronomically larger.

2648
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,080
So the Boltzmann

2649
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:29,080
brain requires a maximum complex

2650
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,080
operator, in which you transfer the whole

2651
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:33,080
universe in one step

2652
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:35,080
into a state that is not correlated.

2653
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,080
And again,

2654
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,080
I want to break it down a bit

2655
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,080
again, but on one example.

2656
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,080
In the multiverse, one would think,

2657
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:47,080
there is now also a universe

2658
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,080
in which my hand is somehow

2659
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,080
just above my head.

2660
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,080
And in fact you don't know if

2661
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:55,080
that is possible. You don't know if

2662
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,080
through the repeated applications of one operator

2663
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:59,080
somewhere

2664
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,080
such a branch ends in the situation

2665
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,080
that I raise my arm.

2666
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,080
So I don't do it on purpose so that we

2667
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:07,080
can continue to doubt whether it is possible.

2668
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,080
But with the normal, what I meant,

2669
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:11,080
multiversum theories, they would say

2670
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:13,080
that everything is there,

2671
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:15,080
what is possible. So do you know a little

2672
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,080
what I mean? I know what you mean.

2673
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:19,080
You just answered and maybe I didn't

2674
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,080
really understand it, but...

2675
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:23,080
Yes, the thing is that it is not clear

2676
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:25,080
how we should prove

2677
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:27,080
that we come to a universe through the simple

2678
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,080
application of operators

2679
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:31,080
that looks so macroscopically similar to us

2680
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:33,080
and would be allowed,

2681
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,080
but possibly does not work

2682
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,080
microscopically. Exactly, okay.

2683
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:39,080
So it could just be that many imaginable things

2684
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:41,080
are not possible

2685
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:43,080
in the real world. They are

2686
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,080
still there. Even if we

2687
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,080
think, yes, if we could

2688
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:49,080
imagine it, of course the imagination is not complete

2689
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:51,080
and it is not implemented in the imagination,

2690
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:53,080
then it would still be possible. We had

2691
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,080
questions yesterday. Did I

2692
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:57,080
satisfy what you asked?

2693
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,080
Yes.

2694
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:01,080
Yes.

2695
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,080
That is also a bit Wolfram's idea

2696
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:05,080
that through the application of all operators

2697
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,080
still something specific happens

2698
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:09,080
and not somehow,

2699
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:11,080
so everything happens, but that the roulette

2700
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,080
still somehow has a structure or something.

2701
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,080
Everything is possible, it is something specific

2702
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,080
in the end. Yes.

2703
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:19,080
Yes. Exactly, but it is something

2704
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,080
not, so to speak, one percent homogeneous

2705
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:23,080
or something like that, which always looks exactly

2706
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,080
the same in every direction and so on.

2707
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,080
You could somehow think that.

2708
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:29,080
And that means,

2709
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,080
but if we now express ourselves in this

2710
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,080
classical language of philosophy,

2711
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:35,080
then there is something

2712
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,080
that we, well, then there is a difference

2713
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:39,080
between what is possible

2714
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:41,080
and what we can imagine.

2715
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,080
You could say,

2716
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,080
for example, that somehow God's face

2717
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:47,080
appears in the clouds there or

2718
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:49,080
the unicorn flies through here or something like that.

2719
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,080
We can imagine that, but we can

2720
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:53,080
perhaps not imagine

2721
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,080
that with the complete

2722
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:57,080
causality catch up to the beginning.

2723
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,080
And that's why we don't know

2724
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:01,080
whether it is actually a possibility,

2725
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,080
even if it is a possible possibility.

2726
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:05,080
Yes, that means

2727
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:07,080
if we say imaginable,

2728
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,080
then we have to make it clear that our

2729
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,080
representations are very fluid.

2730
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:13,080
We can imagine

2731
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,080
that we are millionaires,

2732
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:17,080
but the problem is to get the causal chain

2733
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,080
that leads us to become millionaires

2734
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,080
is very complex.

2735
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:23,080
That means,

2736
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:25,080
to trigger the control process

2737
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,080
that leads to a representation

2738
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,080
being justified,

2739
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:31,080
is the problem.

2740
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,080
And the control processes are ultimately

2741
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,080
on the lowest level of causality

2742
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:37,080
of the universe and then swing up.

2743
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,080
And a control process means,

2744
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:41,080
it's a term from the theory of regulation,

2745
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,080
from the humanistic theory,

2746
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,080
that you have a system that

2747
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:47,080
stabilizes its own structure,

2748
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,080
that can be described as if it were to do so.

2749
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,080
And that means that as soon as

2750
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:53,080
it runs out of certain parameters,

2751
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,080
a counter-force appears that leads

2752
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:57,080
to push it back into these parameters.

2753
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,080
And in the case of the

2754
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,080
whirl on the surface of the water,

2755
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,080
it is as simple as possible.

2756
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:05,080
Because with the whirl in the surface of the water,

2757
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,080
you move your hand at the beginning

2758
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:09,080
and all vectors arise in the water molecules.

2759
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,080
And most of these lead

2760
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,080
to the fact that the information

2761
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,080
that is created by the whirl

2762
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,080
is no longer recognizable.

2763
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,080
After a short time, the waves scatter

2764
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:21,080
and only a very small part of this information

2765
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:23,080
leads to the stable whirl structure.

2766
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,080
The rest

2767
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,080
simply dissipates out.

2768
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,080
It simply evaporates.

2769
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,080
It evaporates into the background.

2770
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:33,080
And only the part that, so to speak,

2771
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:35,080
selects itself for it,

2772
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,080
by having the exact right vector

2773
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:39,080
to keep itself in this circle, stays there.

2774
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:41,080
And at the next higher level,

2775
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:43,080
these systems can interact with each other.

2776
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:45,080
And they form stable systems

2777
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,080
that you can squish a little.

2778
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,080
And they come back

2779
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,080
to their starting point.

2780
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:53,080
This ideal whirl, as soon as you squish it,

2781
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,080
it dissolves.

2782
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,080
But in the whirl

2783
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:59,080
that you see in the surface of the water,

2784
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:01,080
it is already a bit more stable.

2785
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:03,080
For example, the surface of the water has viscosity.

2786
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,080
That means the molecules

2787
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,080
target the surface of the water

2788
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:09,080
in a certain way, so that it tries

2789
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,080
to stay stable, but is also stretchable.

2790
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:13,080
And that means that the thing already has a certain

2791
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,080
robustness when you push against it

2792
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:17,080
and cause disturbance,

2793
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:19,080
so that it moves back to its original form

2794
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:21,080
and is elastic.

2795
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:23,080
Or imagine a soap bubble.

2796
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,080
A soap bubble is such a thing

2797
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,080
where you have a structure

2798
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:29,080
in 3D

2799
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:31,080
that balances several

2800
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,080
criteria against each other,

2801
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:35,080
namely the surface tension of the fluid

2802
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,080
that forms the border of the soap bubble

2803
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,080
and the pressure of the air inside.

2804
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:41,080
And the two of them push against each other

2805
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:43,080
so strongly that a stable structure

2806
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,080
exists that can withstand many disturbances.

2807
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:47,080
Or imagine

2808
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:49,080
a water molecule

2809
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,080
in which you have

2810
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:53,080
two hydrogen atoms

2811
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:55,080
and a oxygen atom.

2812
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:57,080
And they are bound together

2813
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,080
by the actinomatism

2814
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:01,080
that arises in the atom shells

2815
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,080
and leads to electron pairs.

2816
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:05,080
You can squish the thing

2817
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:07,080
to a certain extent

2818
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:09,080
and it comes back to its original state.

2819
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,080
And the things that are stable

2820
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:13,080
over a wide range of squishings

2821
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,080
are the periodic table of elements.

2822
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:17,080
And those that are not, are things

2823
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,080
that fall apart relatively quickly.

2824
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,080
Or fall apart immediately.

2825
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:23,080
And the rare elements are the ones

2826
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:25,080
that fall apart very quickly

2827
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:27,080
under the conditions in which they exist.

2828
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:29,080
That is, they do not stay stable for long,

2829
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:31,080
but fall apart when there are small disturbances.

2830
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:33,080
But the interesting thing about them

2831
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:35,080
is that the disturbances

2832
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:37,080
are always regulated instantly.

2833
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,080
So similar to the thermostat.

2834
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,080
The thermostat is a controller

2835
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,080
that only measures the current

2836
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,080
and only regulates in the current.

2837
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,080
And the really interesting control systems

2838
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:49,080
are the ones that regulate the future.

2839
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:51,080
So they are prepared

2840
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,080
for a number of possible disturbances

2841
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,080
in the future and are able

2842
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,080
to intervene on future disturbances

2843
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:59,080
in such a way that they now

2844
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,080
lead the appropriate future.

2845
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:03,080
We call them agents.

2846
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,080
An agent is a controller

2847
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:07,080
for future conditions.

2848
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,080
And then it turns out that the easiest

2849
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:11,080
agents that we can see in nature,

2850
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:13,080
which at least I can see, are cells.

2851
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,080
It is a kind of super molecule

2852
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,080
that I can keep stable

2853
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:19,080
over many, many types of environmental conditions

2854
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,080
so that it can predict the future.

2855
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:23,080
And the cell is a totally fascinating system.

2856
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:25,080
It consists on the one hand

2857
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:27,080
of a self-replicator

2858
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:29,080
and on the other hand of a Turing machine.

2859
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:31,080
The Turing machine has a typewriter,

2860
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,080
the reprisome,

2861
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:35,080
and the DNA.

2862
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:37,080
And all of these are small tapes

2863
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:39,080
that spin around additionally.

2864
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:41,080
And then there is a neck entropy extractor,

2865
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,080
a system that is able

2866
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:45,080
to become stable against disturbances

2867
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,080
by spilling these disturbances

2868
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:49,080
out of the system.

2869
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:51,080
And the structures on which

2870
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:53,080
these disturbances are written,

2871
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:55,080
such as molecules that move quickly

2872
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,080
and are warm, are spilt out of the cell

2873
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,080
that you collect,

2874
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:01,080
do not have this information that disturbs you.

2875
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:03,080
In order to be stable,

2876
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,080
an agent has to be able to forget

2877
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:07,080
the disturbances that are added to him.

2878
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,080
Otherwise, the knowledge about these disturbances

2879
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:11,080
accumulates in the information collection.

2880
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,080
And in order to achieve this,

2881
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,080
you have to, so to speak,

2882
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:19,080
clean yourself all the time.

2883
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,080
And if you do something clean,

2884
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:23,080
something else becomes dirty.

2885
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,080
And what becomes dirty, you have to push out of yourself.

2886
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:27,080
We all live on Earth in a way

2887
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:29,080
that it encodes disturbances

2888
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:31,080
into particles,

2889
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:33,080
mostly as speed differences

2890
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:35,080
in particles.

2891
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,080
And this statistic of speed differences

2892
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:39,080
in particles is called heat.

2893
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:41,080
And it is then radiated

2894
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:43,080
into the deep space.

2895
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,080
This is the sink for the whole entropy.

2896
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,080
And we fill up these particles

2897
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:49,080
by collecting fresh photons

2898
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:51,080
that are nicely sorted from the sun.

2899
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:53,080
And the sun is, so to speak,

2900
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,080
a neck entropy of order

2901
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:57,080
that we convert into disorder.

2902
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:59,080
And we, as organisms,

2903
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:01,080
exist as pumps

2904
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:03,080
from order to disorder.

2905
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:05,080
This allows us to maintain

2906
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:07,080
our structure

2907
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:09,080
and by building more and more structures,

2908
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:11,080
building more and more complexity,

2909
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:13,080
we are able to convert more and more

2910
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,080
of this neck entropy

2911
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,080
into disorder.

2912
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:21,080
You just presented

2913
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:23,080
a fascinating model

2914
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:25,080
with which one can build

2915
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,080
a foundation for the four core questions

2916
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:29,080
of philosophy.

2917
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:31,080
And you also said

2918
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:33,080
that you are not the first

2919
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,080
to do this.

2920
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:37,080
But why have so few people

2921
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:39,080
accepted this so far?

2922
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,080
In physics, in philosophy,

2923
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:43,080
also in mathematics.

2924
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:45,080
Of course, I could say that many people

2925
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:47,080
in computer science have accepted this.

2926
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:49,080
You just talked about

2927
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,080
Paul Bauer,

2928
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:53,080
who has already tried

2929
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,080
to lead this struggle

2930
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,080
in the academy, so to speak.

2931
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:59,080
And I think,

2932
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:01,080
yes, exactly,

2933
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:03,080
Wildberger does it too.

2934
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:05,080
And I don't know, probably Ed Friedkin

2935
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:07,080
did it. And there are some people

2936
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:09,080
who have tried it.

2937
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:11,080
And the best explanation

2938
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:13,080
that I've heard so far

2939
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,080
why they don't accept it

2940
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,080
– well, I know a little bit

2941
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:19,080
about mathematics – is because

2942
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:21,080
the proofs are simply so inelegant.

2943
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,080
That means,

2944
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:25,080
if I now

2945
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:27,080
do a constructive or

2946
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:29,080
an intuitionist mathematics,

2947
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:31,080
then I just need for some proofs

2948
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:33,080
so much longer.

2949
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:35,080
Before that, I could just say, yes,

2950
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:37,080
assuming that it is not so

2951
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,080
contradictory, done,

2952
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,080
super fast,

2953
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:43,080
not followed by P,

2954
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,080
and that went

2955
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:47,080
on for half a page. And if I

2956
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:49,080
want to do this constructively,

2957
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:51,080
then I might need ten pages

2958
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:53,080
or so for it. That means, I think,

2959
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:55,080
why mathematicians don't accept it

2960
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,080
is because they first think,

2961
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:59,080
yes, it works, what we do.

2962
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,080
We don't have any problems. Why should we change anything?

2963
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:03,080
That you can't

2964
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:05,080
put it in a computer.

2965
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,080
The pure mathematicians are not really interested in that.

2966
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:09,080
And they find it somehow

2967
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:11,080
inelegant. Do you think

2968
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:13,080
that's an argument? Can you understand that?

2969
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,080
Do you think,

2970
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:17,080
while doing that,

2971
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:19,080
do you have an idea

2972
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,080
if there are people who try it?

2973
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:23,080
I have recently read a little introduction

2974
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:25,080
to constructive analysis.

2975
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,080
I think it was from 1967 or so.

2976
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:29,080
And then

2977
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,080
the introduction was like, yes, and I'm sure

2978
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:33,080
that in the end we will be kept right.

2979
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,080
And not,

2980
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:37,080
it won't take too long.

2981
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:39,080
Now it's 50 years

2982
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:41,080
or even longer, and nothing has

2983
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:43,080
been done.

2984
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:45,080
Do you see a way?

2985
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:47,080
I have the impression that something is already happening.

2986
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:49,080
Just like in philosophy

2987
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,080
something is happening. It's just

2988
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:53,080
that the rest doesn't go away.

2989
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:55,080
And what very rarely

2990
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,080
happens in science is that a group

2991
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:59,080
of people who have built

2992
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:01,080
a tradition for a long time

2993
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,080
looks at themselves

2994
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,080
and says, okay,

2995
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:07,080
we're giving it up now, or we're done now.

2996
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,080
But in the end

2997
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:11,080
these currents are all self-contained

2998
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:13,080
if there are enough time spaces

2999
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:15,080
over time.

3000
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:17,080
And the other problem is that so and so much

3001
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:19,080
fits into the human mind over the lifetime.

3002
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:21,080
I met

3003
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:23,080
Sam Adams, a computer scientist,

3004
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:25,080
an AI researcher.

3005
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,080
I went to a conference.

3006
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:29,080
He worked at IBM for many years

3007
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:31,080
and said he had a very

3008
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:33,080
vague feeling when he went to an AI

3009
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:35,080
conference with me,

3010
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,080
because he had the impression that he

3011
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:39,080
had been out of the current

3012
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:41,080
business for 20 years,

3013
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,080
in the artificial intelligence

3014
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,080
and that he was probably completely

3015
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:47,080
detached. He had continued

3016
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:49,080
building his own things all the time,

3017
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,080
but maybe since Minsky and so on

3018
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:53,080
what he read and thought back then

3019
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,080
is already so much further

3020
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:57,080
and the new generation

3021
02:07:57,080 --> 02:07:59,080
has gone far away from him.

3022
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,080
And after we left the conference

3023
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:03,080
and went home, he said, we have to hurry.

3024
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:05,080
I mean, I'm old now, but if we can't do it,

3025
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:07,080
this generation can't do it,

3026
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,080
because they know less than we do.

3027
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:13,080
And this thing that you

3028
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:15,080
realize at some point, when I was young,

3029
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:17,080
I had the impression that a lot

3030
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:19,080
happened in cognitive science, that there was

3031
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,080
an extremely high frequency with which

3032
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:23,080
you had groundbreaking new insights

3033
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:25,080
that came in that changed everything.

3034
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:27,080
And now I have the impression

3035
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:29,080
that every generation still has to

3036
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:31,080
make all the mistakes of the previous generation

3037
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:33,080
again, because you can

3038
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:35,080
make things so difficult for yourself.

3039
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:37,080
And finally, to make progress,

3040
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:39,080
you as an individual

3041
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:41,080
have to dig yourself down a little bit

3042
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:43,080
from the basics and then come back

3043
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:45,080
to the limit and rebuild something at the limit.

3044
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:47,080
And this process takes so long

3045
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,080
that there is not always a shortcut.

3046
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,080
And you can't

3047
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,080
rely on others

3048
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,080
because there are so many schools

3049
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,080
that don't have a clear picture

3050
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:59,080
of their basics, or there are individuals

3051
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,080
that don't have a clear picture of their basics.

3052
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,080
And in computer science and mathematics

3053
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:05,080
it is even easier.

3054
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,080
In other sciences it is much more difficult.

3055
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:09,080
So, in short,

3056
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,080
the reason why

3057
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:13,080
there is no agreement about it,

3058
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:15,080
not even in mathematics itself,

3059
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:17,080
but also not about the different

3060
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,080
branches of philosophy or

3061
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:21,080
of science or of social

3062
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,080
flow that you try to recognize,

3063
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:25,080
is the Tower of Babel.

3064
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:27,080
The Tower of Babel is the idea that

3065
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,080
we are able to build

3066
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:31,080
the only building

3067
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:33,080
that conquers the entire sky.

3068
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:35,080
And the meaning of Heavens

3069
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,080
back then was different

3070
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:39,080
than what we understood later.

3071
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:41,080
Today we translate Heavens

3072
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,080
as an imaginary place that exists

3073
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:45,080
in a superstitious way

3074
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:47,080
and in which non-existent

3075
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,080
supernatural agents stay.

3076
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:51,080
God and angels and

3077
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:53,080
the souls of the dead

3078
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:55,080
or whatever.

3079
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:57,080
And I think that this is a

3080
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:59,080
very important point.

3081
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:01,080
Also a part of the Tower of Babel.

3082
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,080
Where Heaven and Earth

3083
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,080
first appear is in Genesis

3084
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:07,080
and it describes

3085
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,080
that consciousness

3086
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,080
is hanging over the substrate

3087
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:13,080
and I think that happens

3088
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,080
in every single one of us.

3089
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:17,080
And the border in the substrate

3090
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,080
is between the world model and the idea sphere.

3091
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,080
And we realize that

3092
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:23,080
in our mind there is a world model

3093
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:25,080
that is what we perceive as stuff in space

3094
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:27,080
not in the physical sense

3095
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:29,080
but in the sense where we see people

3096
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,080
with geometry and colors and ideas

3097
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:33,080
and thoughts that touch things.

3098
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:35,080
This stuff in space is a game engine

3099
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,080
that our brain generates.

3100
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:39,080
And this is a very special kind of mental state

3101
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:41,080
mental state

3102
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:43,080
because it is correlated to our perception.

3103
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:45,080
That means we are in resonance

3104
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:47,080
with the world around us

3105
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,080
through our nervous system

3106
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,080
that is coupled with the world

3107
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:53,080
and we build this world model

3108
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,080
and the processes around us are tracked.

3109
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,080
This world model is stuff in space.

3110
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,080
And in the text of Genesis 1

3111
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:01,080
they call it Earth

3112
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:03,080
or world.

3113
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:05,080
And the world is simply the world model.

3114
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:07,080
Rest extensa

3115
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:09,080
in the Dekarczian sense

3116
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,080
is not the physics

3117
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:13,080
but it is a mental state

3118
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:15,080
that describes the world model.

3119
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:17,080
And everything else

3120
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:19,080
that we have in our mind

3121
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,080
that is not the world model

3122
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:23,080
these are the heavens, the idea spheres

3123
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,080
the space in which we have thoughts

3124
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,080
about the world that are temporarily

3125
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:29,080
decoupled and can also be

3126
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:31,080
semantically decoupled from our perception.

3127
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:33,080
And in fact there are these two areas

3128
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:35,080
in our spirit and in every spirit

3129
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:37,080
that we know.

3130
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:39,080
So every human and most complicated

3131
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:41,080
animals have a world model

3132
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:43,080
and a space of ideas

3133
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:45,080
that cannot be directly reflected

3134
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:47,080
on perception in the outer environment

3135
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,080
or the proprioception.

3136
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:51,080
And if we now go back

3137
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:53,080
and think about what is heaven

3138
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,080
that is simply the idea sphere

3139
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,080
the noosphere.

3140
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:59,080
And to bring the idea into this space

3141
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:01,080
is the project of the tower

3142
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:03,080
to Babel in this myth.

3143
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:05,080
And this project failed

3144
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:07,080
because the people

3145
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:09,080
did not manage to find a common language

3146
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:11,080
that remained coherent.

3147
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:13,080
The more people worked on it

3148
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:15,080
the more special the languages were

3149
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:17,080
and the more difficult they were to translate.

3150
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:19,080
And that is why the tower fell apart.

3151
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:21,080
So the whole tower broke apart.

3152
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:23,080
God guided her somehow

3153
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:25,080
or gave her the language

3154
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,080
that she could no longer understand.

3155
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:29,080
He somehow found the project dangerous.

3156
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:31,080
How is that?

3157
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:33,080
It can be.

3158
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,080
But logically it is the case that

3159
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,080
the churches have the impression

3160
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:39,080
that the rationalists are trying

3161
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:41,080
to explain the world and forget God

3162
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:43,080
and can no longer explain

3163
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:45,080
and therefore cannot

3164
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:47,080
underline the world.

3165
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:49,080
And if we take our original definition

3166
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:51,080
of God from earlier

3167
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:53,080
from this afternoon

3168
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:55,080
then it was the small written God

3169
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:57,080
the general gods

3170
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:59,080
are simply themselves

3171
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:01,080
that surround different spirits

3172
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:03,080
and the big written God

3173
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:05,080
is the total God

3174
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:07,080
the greatest, best God

3175
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:09,080
that we can construct.

3176
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:11,080
And if we build a civilization

3177
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:13,080
like ours, then it works by doing

3178
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:15,080
even if no one is watching.

3179
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:17,080
That is, the agent that we build together

3180
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:19,080
the system of agency

3181
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,080
that we create together

3182
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:23,080
the system in which we control the future together

3183
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:25,080
in the most harmonious possible way

3184
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,080
that is God.

3185
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,080
God is created by the fact that we recognize

3186
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:31,080
that it makes sense to seek harmony

3187
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:33,080
that we make our behavior

3188
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:35,080
so coherent with each other

3189
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:37,080
as we make our behavior so coherent

3190
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,080
in our own spirit

3191
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:41,080
that our hands do something together

3192
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:43,080
In a way, a society should ideally work

3193
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,080
in such a way that the individuals

3194
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:47,080
do not work against each other

3195
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:49,080
but are coherent.

3196
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:51,080
But they are not coherent to do something similar

3197
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:53,080
but coherent according to the best possible

3198
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:55,080
set of structural principles

3199
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:57,080
that can be discovered.

3200
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:59,080
And that is what the churches

3201
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:01,080
try to stabilize.

3202
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:03,080
That is, they try to practically synchronize

3203
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:05,080
the gods with the people

3204
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:07,080
so that at the end a civilization is created

3205
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:09,080
that is harmonious

3206
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:11,080
and that the best possible survival

3207
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:13,080
and the longest possible survival is possible for us.

3208
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:15,080
That is the idea behind it.

3209
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:17,080
And the scientists often do not recognize that.

3210
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:19,080
And possibly the message

3211
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,080
why the story of the tower of Babel

3212
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,080
is told like that

3213
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:25,080
it is not only told as an observation

3214
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:27,080
but as a normative

3215
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:29,080
there is a message in it that God wants to send to the people

3216
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:31,080
is that if you believe too much

3217
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:33,080
in what you do in your private languages

3218
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:35,080
then at the end there is no coherent system

3219
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:37,080
that breaks together in your civilization.

3220
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:41,080
The interpretation is that

3221
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:43,080
I do not agree with the text.

3222
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:45,080
The thing is that there are computational languages

3223
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:47,080
that did not discover them back then.

3224
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:49,080
They did not discover the theory of the Church

3225
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:51,080
they did not discover that they are all equally powerful.

3226
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:53,080
And today we find that out.

3227
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,080
We find out why it is possible

3228
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,080
that our own spirit agrees with itself on a language

3229
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:59,080
and how it would be conceivable

3230
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:01,080
that one finds a harmonization

3231
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,080
over all possible spirits

3232
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:05,080
who are able to think so far

3233
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:07,080
that they can shape the foundations of their own thinking

3234
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:09,080
in the space of all metaphysics

3235
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:11,080
and find out which metaphysics

3236
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:13,080
can work

3237
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,080
build a metametaphysics

3238
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:17,080
from which one can derive all possible world models

3239
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:19,080
which are coherent in themselves

3240
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:21,080
and translate them into human beings.

3241
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:25,080
A short question, how is it with the light?

3242
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:27,080
It glows interesting

3243
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:29,080
but it is not a big problem

3244
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:31,080
because in front of me there are various microphones

3245
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:33,080
that I can use in between.

3246
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:35,080
How does it look on the camera?

3247
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:37,080
We can also do it like this

3248
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,080
that we turn the table

3249
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:41,080
with 90 degrees

3250
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,080
then the sun comes from the side.

3251
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:45,080
This meme is for me

3252
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,080
a strange thing

3253
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:49,080
when you express it here and say

3254
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,080
Franz that you want to hang it on the kitchen wall.

3255
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:53,080
For me it was more of a fleeting thing

3256
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:55,080
that you quickly

3257
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,080
produce within a few minutes.

3258
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,080
But it is a bit like that from the ...

3259
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:01,080
That's why I think it's so good

3260
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:03,080
because these are memes.

3261
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:05,080
It is this fleeting meme-like

3262
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:07,080
but there is so beautiful

3263
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,080
idea space in it

3264
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:11,080
and this combination makes it

3265
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:13,080
my favorite meme so far.

3266
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,080
The thing is that you ...

3267
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:17,080
The memes work because

3268
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:19,080
they capture something so quickly

3269
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:21,080
but what they capture is sometimes quite complex.

3270
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:23,080
For me the meme is a bit like

3271
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:25,080
the famous Chinese painter

3272
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:27,080
who is commissioned by the king

3273
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:29,080
to paint birds

3274
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:31,080
and he

3275
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:33,080
sits there all the time

3276
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:35,080
and sketches and throws away

3277
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:37,080
and sketches and throws away and so on and so forth

3278
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:39,080
and then the king comes to him and says to him

3279
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:41,080
where is the bird that you should paint for me?

3280
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:43,080
And the artist

3281
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,080
sits down, takes a fresh sheet of paper

3282
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:47,080
takes his brush and makes

3283
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:49,080
a complex stroke and has the bird.

3284
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:51,080
And the king is super

3285
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:53,080
disappointed and says

3286
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:55,080
why? You just did it so quickly.

3287
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:57,080
What is the thing?

3288
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:59,080
And he says, no, to make it

3289
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:01,080
I had to become the one who can do it all.

3290
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:03,080
And for me it is also like that.

3291
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:05,080
For me it is the result of

3292
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:07,080
thinking about all the stuff for several decades

3293
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:09,080
and then trying to draw my own path

3294
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:11,080
and to think about

3295
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:13,080
which steps I have come up with.

3296
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:15,080
And of course it is not the only

3297
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:17,080
possible path and probably

3298
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:19,080
not the end of the path because many details are missing.

3299
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:21,080
But it is interesting to

3300
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,080
get to know yourself.

3301
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:25,080
And the great thing about this medium Twitter

3302
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:27,080
is that you ...

3303
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:29,080
that there are so many people on it

3304
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:31,080
that you can develop very special thoughts.

3305
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:33,080
And then when you

3306
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,080
train your followers accordingly

3307
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:37,080
so that they are able to get along with it

3308
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:39,080
you just have among your

3309
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:41,080
tens of thousands of followers always some

3310
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:43,080
who can get along with your thoughts and who can interface

3311
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,080
and can bring you further into the discussion.

3312
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:49,080
And here you also have to shout out

3313
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:51,080
to the expanding brain thing itself

3314
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:53,080
because it really fits on it

3315
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:55,080
so I sometimes still get such jitters

3316
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:57,080
when I only concentrate on the pictures

3317
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,080
together with what is there

3318
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:01,080
and then it's always ...

3319
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:03,080
well.

3320
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:05,080
Yes, it was just such a spiritual ...

3321
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:07,080
it fits together so well that I quickly tap it down

3322
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:09,080
and put it on Twitter.

3323
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:13,080
It is also interesting because for me I would say

3324
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:15,080
if I had to think about

3325
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:17,080
what my intellectual

3326
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:19,080
trajectory has most influenced

3327
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,080
then it was probably

3328
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:23,080
this nerd Twitter bubble

3329
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:25,080
and for most people

3330
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:27,080
Twitter is not the place

3331
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:29,080
where you think you can find knowledge

3332
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:31,080
because at the same time so many nerdy things happen

3333
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:33,080
but also so beautiful.

3334
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:35,080
Sure, as soon as I get out of my filter bubble

3335
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,080
it gets uncomfortable.

3336
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,080
Some people think that filter bubble is something totally bad

3337
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:41,080
but filter bubble is the equivalent

3338
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:43,080
of a room in which you

3339
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:45,080
can play a concert, for example.

3340
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:47,080
Another is a box match, another is a kindergarten

3341
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:49,080
and another is a

3342
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:51,080
theater play and they can all

3343
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:53,080
only work because they are separated

3344
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:55,080
and because they can separate

3345
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:57,080
for the duration of the performance.

3346
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:01,080
We wrote a few more comments about this meme

3347
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:03,080
which was also

3348
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:05,080
part of the experience

3349
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:07,080
when the meme was aired on Twitter.

3350
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:11,080
One comment below was

3351
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:13,080
there is no independent truth

3352
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:15,080
then you answered welcome to level 2

3353
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:17,080
and the person answered with a smiley

3354
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:19,080
got me.

3355
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:21,080
Very nice interaction.

3356
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,080
At level 1 you think

3357
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,080
that logic is absolute

3358
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:27,080
and at level 2 you can see

3359
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:29,080
that the logic depends on

3360
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:31,080
the definition in the action system.

3361
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:33,080
We have not yet come to the point

3362
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:35,080
where we can have any action system

3363
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:37,080
which is not available

3364
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:39,080
so it is only level 2.

3365
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:43,080
What did you answer with level 3?

3366
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:47,080
What is that?

3367
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:51,080
What is the definition in a formal language?

3368
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,080
It can be defined in any way we want.

3369
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:15,080
What if the universe contains

3370
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:17,080
non-computable processes?

3371
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:19,080
Computation with general

3372
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:21,080
real-valued variables?

3373
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:23,080
Level 3.

3374
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:25,080
At this point we have not

3375
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:27,080
taken the step to constructive mathematics

3376
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:29,080
and believe that

3377
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:31,080
languages that are not implementable

3378
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:33,080
are suitable to

3379
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:35,080
describe truth in such a way

3380
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,080
that you can claim that all these things exist.

3381
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:39,080
Truth

3382
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:41,080
that can work with it

3383
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:43,080
must exist in the form

3384
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,080
that is, it must be implementable

3385
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:47,080
that is, it is pre-computationalist.

3386
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,080
Exactly, it is the case that

3387
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,080
he took the kettlebell

3388
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,080
but he has not yet come out

3389
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:15,080
and has understood the consequence.

3390
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:17,080
That is, he is exactly at the point

3391
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:19,080
where he sees that these languages

3392
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:21,080
that he uses to describe reality

3393
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:23,080
are running in boundaries

3394
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:25,080
because they run in self-contradictions

3395
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:27,080
and that means that the reality he builds with

3396
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,080
does not end and he does not see the way out of it.

3397
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:45,080
Universe is a computer

3398
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:47,080
but that we can build universal computers

3399
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:49,080
capable of simulating any physical system.

3400
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,080
Thoughts?

3401
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,080
Level 4.

3402
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,080
That he has not yet taken the step

3403
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:17,080
to recognize that

3404
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:19,080
the pre-computational languages

3405
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:21,080
are running in contradictions.

3406
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:23,080
The thing is, when we accept

3407
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:25,080
that nothing can be thought of

3408
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:27,080
that is not computational

3409
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:29,080
and nothing can be observed

3410
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:31,080
then we can not even

3411
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:33,080
refer to this universe

3412
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:35,080
in our thoughts.

3413
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:37,080
Of course, every system

3414
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,080
in which we speak about something

3415
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:41,080
can only refer to the system itself.

3416
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:43,080
If we have a representation system

3417
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:45,080
in which we can talk about the universe

3418
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:47,080
and think about it

3419
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:49,080
then we can only talk and think about

3420
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,080
universes that can be reproduced

3421
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:53,080
in the representation system.

3422
02:22:53,080 --> 02:22:55,080
And to claim that they can exist

3423
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:57,080
does not make sense

3424
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:59,080
because every alternative to the system

3425
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:01,080
leads to contradictions.

3426
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:03,080
That is, the systems that we can think about

3427
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:05,080
and that we can claim

3428
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:07,080
that it is a universe

3429
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:09,080
must be in the class of systems

3430
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:11,080
that can be described in languages

3431
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:13,080
that are not self-contradictory

3432
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:15,080
because the others are not existent.

3433
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:17,080
And also not thinkable in that sense.

3434
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:19,080
Yes, that's what it means.

3435
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,080
We can not think about it

3436
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:23,080
in such a way that our language does not break.

3437
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:25,080
And I think that's the big thing

3438
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:27,080
that still confuses people

3439
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:29,080
even further.

3440
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,080
That they somehow think, well,

3441
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:33,080
it could be that it is continuous

3442
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:35,080
and they still do not notice

3443
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:37,080
that the idea of continuous

3444
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:39,080
has the same meaning

3445
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:41,080
as a direct contradiction at the end.

3446
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:43,080
Yes, but each of these ideas has confused me

3447
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:45,080
for a long time.

3448
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:47,080
For me it is really a progression

3449
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:49,080
that I have made myself

3450
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:51,080
because I had to find out why it is so and so.

3451
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:53,080
And I did not have the feeling

3452
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:55,080
that someone helped me, but on the contrary.

3453
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:57,080
I tried to get it out

3454
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:59,080
against the institutions

3455
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:01,080
that explained to me that they are the axioms

3456
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:03,080
and I realize, no,

3457
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:05,080
your identity concept is not mine

3458
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:07,080
because it does not work that way

3459
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:09,080
when I try to think.

3460
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:29,080
This is a complicated question.

3461
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:31,080
The thing is that on the lowest level

3462
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:33,080
where we do not need a memory,

3463
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:35,080
so to speak, and the universe

3464
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:37,080
only exists as a condition

3465
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,080
in the space of the possible,

3466
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:41,080
the question is, is there

3467
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:43,080
a limitation?

3468
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:45,080
So is the possible

3469
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:47,080
limited by something?

3470
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:49,080
Or if there is boundlessness

3471
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:51,080
on the lowest level of the possibility,

3472
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:53,080
then of course it leads

3473
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:55,080
to an infinity.

3474
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:57,080
It is just that the operators

3475
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:59,080
who work on it

3476
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:01,080
usually cannot lead to structures

3477
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:03,080
that inevitably integrate many elements

3478
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:05,080
from one step to the next.

3479
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:07,080
And that means

3480
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:09,080
that there is a limit

3481
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:11,080
where the question for me

3482
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:13,080
is not clear and I suspect

3483
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:15,080
that the unboundedness

3484
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:17,080
on the lowest level, because we do not

3485
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:19,080
need a memory and no sequential

3486
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:21,080
addition of operations,

3487
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:23,080
theoretically could lead to an infinity.

3488
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:25,080
But it is not

3489
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:27,080
a constructive infinity.

3490
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:29,080
That is, wherever we accept that the universe

3491
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,080
is constructive, where we describe things

3492
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:33,080
as transitions through other things

3493
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:35,080
and the world in which

3494
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:37,080
we have, for example, information

3495
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:39,080
and structure formation,

3496
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:41,080
wherever information and structure

3497
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:43,080
formation play a role, it probably

3498
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:45,080
cannot work.

3499
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:47,080
And that is something where I

3500
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:49,080
do not see the clear proof. I have the impression

3501
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:51,080
that I see it, but I cannot

3502
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:53,080
write it down formally. That is why

3503
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:55,080
it is so that I hallucinate it.

3504
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:57,080
But then I have another question, if you

3505
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:59,080
talk about the lowest possible level

3506
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,080
where the unboundedness becomes a real infinity,

3507
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:03,080
then we get the same

3508
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:05,080
problems, or that you

3509
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:07,080
simply cannot keep the concept infinity

3510
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:09,080
up at all, because if you look closely,

3511
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:11,080
it is exactly the same.

3512
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:13,080
It is above all the next

3513
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:15,080
problem is that I cannot talk about it,

3514
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:17,080
that is, I cannot think about it. And since I

3515
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:19,080
cannot think about it, it cannot

3516
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,080
be claimed in any way

3517
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:23,080
that we are in it.

3518
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:25,080
Because I cannot refer to the thing where

3519
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,080
we are supposed to be in it.

3520
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:29,080
I always imagine that when I have

3521
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:31,080
continual ideas about

3522
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:33,080
the universe, or space, or time,

3523
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:35,080
I simply replace it with

3524
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:37,080
x and not x. And then I say

3525
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:39,080
that what I am currently thinking

3526
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:41,080
about has exactly the same

3527
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:43,080
meaning as this. It is simply

3528
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:45,080
another token for contradiction.

3529
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,080
And that is it.

3530
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:49,080
But that is something where I say,

3531
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:51,080
as far as I understand it logically,

3532
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:53,080
there is no possibility that we are in

3533
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:55,080
the universe. But it is also the case

3534
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:57,080
that when I go through my one progression,

3535
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:59,080
through these steps, it was often the case

3536
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:01,080
that I am at a point where I say

3537
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:03,080
I cannot logically understand why

3538
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:05,080
there is something, instead of something else.

3539
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:07,080
This question seems, in principle,

3540
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:09,080
unanswerable.

3541
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:11,080
And that confused me, because I thought

3542
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:13,080
how can it be that there are questions that

3543
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:15,080
are unanswered, because you can always find a curve.

3544
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:17,080
And at some point you

3545
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:19,080
realize, oh, there is this

3546
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:21,080
solution. But that also shows

3547
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:23,080
how fragile our own thinking is

3548
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:25,080
and how unreliable it is.

3549
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,080
And in the end, unfortunately,

3550
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:29,080
that is something that we have to leave to the machines.

3551
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:35,080
I wanted to read a quote from Einstein

3552
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:37,080
where I wonder

3553
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:39,080
if he describes

3554
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:41,080
similar problems.

3555
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:43,080
I had that in a planning concept, but I don't know

3556
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:45,080
if you read it in such detail.

3557
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:47,080
Einstein on the discreteness of space-time.

3558
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:49,080
But you have correctly

3559
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:51,080
grasped

3560
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:53,080
the drawback

3561
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:55,080
that the continuum brings.

3562
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:57,080
If the molecular view of

3563
02:27:57,080 --> 02:27:59,080
matter is the correct

3564
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:01,080
and appropriate one, that is,

3565
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:03,080
if a part of the universe

3566
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:05,080
is to be represented by a finite number

3567
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:07,080
of moving points,

3568
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,080
then the continuum

3569
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:11,080
of the present theory contains

3570
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:13,080
too great a manifold of possibilities.

3571
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,080
I also believe

3572
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:17,080
that this too great

3573
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:19,080
is responsible for the fact

3574
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:21,080
that our present means of description

3575
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:23,080
miscarry with the quantum theory.

3576
02:28:23,080 --> 02:28:25,080
The problem seems to me

3577
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:27,080
how one can formulate statements

3578
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:29,080
about a discontinuum

3579
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:31,080
without calling

3580
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:33,080
upon a continuum

3581
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:35,080
as an aid.

3582
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:37,080
The letter, the continuum,

3583
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:39,080
should be banned from the theory

3584
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:41,080
as a supplementary construction

3585
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:43,080
not justified by the essence

3586
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:45,080
of the problem, which corresponds

3587
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:47,080
to nothing real.

3588
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:49,080
But we still lack

3589
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:51,080
the mathematical structure, unfortunately.

3590
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:53,080
How much have I already

3591
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:55,080
plagued myself in this way?

3592
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:17,080
The idea that one

3593
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:19,080
can assemble the universe

3594
02:29:19,080 --> 02:29:21,080
from discrete units,

3595
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:23,080
but the idea that one

3596
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:25,080
derives geometry from discrete

3597
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:27,080
operations, from quantum theory

3598
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:29,080
and so on and so forth,

3599
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:31,080
he probably didn't have any tools for that.

3600
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:33,080
And even now it's problematic.

3601
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:35,080
Wolfram tries to do that,

3602
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:37,080
but it's not trivial.

3603
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:39,080
I don't know how much mathematics

3604
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:41,080
is in this area, but Einstein

3605
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:43,080
has seen this possibility.

3606
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,080
He has been confronted with the fact

3607
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:47,080
that there are singularities in space-time.

3608
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:49,080
And singularities

3609
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:51,080
are nothing positive.

3610
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:53,080
That is, that the mathematical description

3611
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,080
no longer works, that you

3612
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:57,080
practically get a division by zero

3613
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:59,080
and the value is no longer valid

3614
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:01,080
that you get.

3615
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:03,080
So singularity means

3616
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:05,080
that practically the dimensions

3617
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:07,080
in which a model is described

3618
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,080
are not sufficient to

3619
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,080
grasp the dynamics of the model.

3620
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:13,080
And he then noticed

3621
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:15,080
that one can push the singularities

3622
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,080
in space-time around,

3623
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:19,080
i.e. these places where space-time

3624
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:21,080
breaks down and then practically push them

3625
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:23,080
into the middle of masses.

3626
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:25,080
And that means that in the middle of masses

3627
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:27,080
there is a point where space-time

3628
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:29,080
no longer really works, but maybe

3629
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:31,080
it's not that bad, maybe it has to do with

3630
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:33,080
how space-time is knotted in a certain way

3631
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:35,080
and runs out of the rudder.

3632
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:37,080
But he was confronted with it relatively early

3633
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:39,080
that the possibility exists that

3634
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:41,080
the space-time description that he makes,

3635
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:43,080
i.e. the continuous geometric space-time

3636
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:45,080
is not suitable to describe the absolute

3637
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:47,080
basics of physics.

3638
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,080
And the other thing is this confrontation

3639
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:51,080
with the quantization of the universe

3640
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,080
that he saw relatively early.

3641
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:55,080
Einstein was a very broad thinker

3642
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:57,080
who did not focus on a certain idea

3643
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:59,080
because he knew

3644
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:01,080
how he made his ideas.

3645
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:03,080
He was not a member, he was not a type

3646
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:05,080
whose theories came about

3647
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:07,080
that he took over from other teachers

3648
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:09,080
that he did not modify easily.

3649
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:11,080
Instead, he is someone who has invented

3650
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:13,080
these ideas all by himself and together with

3651
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:15,080
other people who have also invented ideas

3652
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:17,080
that were discussed about it.

3653
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:19,080
That is, it is a completely different approach

3654
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:21,080
than what scientists experience today

3655
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:23,080
who practically think about subpar themes.

3656
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:25,080
That is, they marry into a school from the beginning

3657
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:27,080
and try to take over the concepts

3658
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:29,080
and try to understand as well as possible,

3659
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:31,080
to make them fit and then add an epsilon.

3660
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:33,080
So since it was clear to him

3661
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:35,080
that he had invented this continuous space-time

3662
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:37,080
to describe the world,

3663
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:39,080
that it was a good formalism,

3664
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:41,080
it is also clear to him

3665
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:43,080
that one can get out of it

3666
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:45,080
and find alternatives.

3667
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:07,080
...

3668
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:09,080
