60000	86520	So, for me, it was with the Meme that I had this ghostly flash and thought, okay, I notice
86520	91760	that when I look back, I had a certain intellectual development and it's not quite
91760	96240	like it's in the memes, but it's such a thing that I also notice with other people
96240	102040	when they think about how logic works. And I thought, okay, we could just
102040	106560	express it with this meme as if it were a journey. And of course it's not a
106560	111480	journey, but it's more of a branch out into different branches and then you end up in
111480	115640	different areas of the meaning space. But for myself, of course, I can
115640	121880	understand my own path. And this first step is one that I haven't stayed in for a long time.
121880	127440	It's about two and a half thousand years old and goes back to Plato and Aristotle. And these
127440	134320	three laws of logic or laws of thought are derived from the syllogisms, i.e. from the forms
134320	138360	in which linguistic logic worked, from the point of view of Aristotle, who tried to
138360	143200	systematize it. And if you look at it from today's point of view, i.e. with the terms of logic
143200	148400	of Tarski and others, then you have the impression that he was right about 80 percent, which is
148400	153440	somehow much better than most contemporary philosophers, so not so bad. And the three
153440	160800	rules he describes are on the one hand the law of identity and almost identity so that a thing
160800	167120	cannot be itself if you do something about it or take it away. And that every thing
167120	172240	has to be self-identical for all things. This is an action with which you can describe identity.
172240	178120	And the next thing is that he says that a thing cannot be true and false at the same time.
178120	185320	So a statement, a statement, a proposition can either be true or false. And the next thing is,
185320	187920	every statement must be either true or false.
187920	190000	Then we get problems afterwards.
190000	194320	Yes, exactly. And I also had problems with all of these things, because at first it
194320	198840	looks like it would work, but I looked at my own thinking and found that
198920	203320	it was not like that in my own thinking. And one thing that I noticed is, for example,
203320	208000	that it starts with identity. When I try to describe things about their identity,
208000	213240	for example when I write a computer program, then it does not capture how identity really is.
213240	217280	So, for example, when I play a computer game myself, when are two objects in this
217280	221720	computer game identical from the point of view of the player? For example, two trees. I can, for example,
221720	226000	define an object in a computer game in the same way as the tree that I then use several times in the
226080	231160	computer game and put it in there. Is that the same tree or is it another tree if it has different
231160	235960	coordinates? That depends on the context. So I can say that it is the same tree that I
235960	240280	encounter several times or there are different trees that only look the same by chance.
240280	245080	Well, you want a functional description level and on certain selected description levels
245080	249920	it is the same, but it already seems to you that if you keep zooming out in the
249920	253240	description, then at some point it is no longer identical, no matter what you want.
253400	259680	There is also this famous ship of the T-Seus, which is such a philosophical paradox that
259680	265720	philosophers like to dig up. It is about the T-Seus building a ship and
265720	269640	that at some point it sank in the Mediterranean and it was so salty all around that it
269640	273360	remained relatively well preserved. And the archaeologists then pull it out at some point,
273360	278560	it is of course somehow weathered and they decide to restore it and take the
278560	283120	individual boards off the ship and replace them with new boards of the same shape and
283120	287560	color. And gradually the ship is restored and looks the same as before and
287560	292120	next to it is a pile of boards. And that is the same ship as before, just renewed. And now
292120	295920	someone else comes and takes this pile of boards and builds the original ship
295920	301160	together again. And what is the ship of the T-Seus? Intuitively, it is
301160	305720	not that easy to find out in which branch we are now entering. And what we
305720	310080	find out is that this identity is not at all a natural category, but a
310080	315240	cognitive category that we apply under certain conditions. And what these
315240	320240	concepts, what these identities are all together is, from my point of view, that we add a world
320240	329520	line to the thing. So we say that this object exists with a series of instances in time and
329520	335040	we therefore bind the instances of this object into one single object. And what is important
335040	338720	is not that it is identical in nature, but only that they share the identity. So this
338760	342440	property of identity and that means in principle have to have a kind of common
342440	347280	biography. And this attribution of the biography, i.e. an imaginary property,
347280	352120	which objects have together over time or over different observations,
352120	357960	that is the essence of the identity in the way I use it in my head. And this
357960	360800	equality of property, which I have, for example, in a certain logical system,
360800	364680	that these are two objects that are identical when they share all properties, is a much
364680	372120	narrower form of identity that I can submit to the thing, i.e. to my identity concept,
372120	378360	but only under certain conditions. We see that we can define identity in different ways
378360	382200	and from this we get different mathematical concepts in which identity can exist.
382200	388320	The next thing can be true or false. For example, I could say I have a variable
388320	392440	in a computer program and that is a variable that can contain bulges, i.e. a truth value,
392600	398320	binaries in this case, which you can have, for example, a logical true or false. And I can
398320	403000	also define a ternary logic, i.e. which I have true and false and undetermined,
403000	408960	or a probabilistic logic in which I have 100 percent or zero as true and false and the
408960	414880	things in between are then further logic values. And in our own head we realize
414880	418840	that we can use different such logics and convert between them under certain conditions.
418840	423440	So a logic that is binary and only knows true and false and a logic that is true,
423440	429440	false and undetermined. And that with the excluded third is even more complicated,
429440	436080	because this logic works what Gödel has found out under certain conditions no longer.
436080	441560	That is, these original laws of logic do not allow these axioms to be
441560	444280	maintained under all conditions. For example, when I allow infinity,
444280	448360	when I look at many features that lead to contradictions. And that was for Gödel,
448840	453560	who thought that he could maintain the axioms, a catastrophe. But for a computer scientist
453560	456520	this is not such a big problem, because the computer scientist says, okay,
456520	462600	in this programming language I define my logic and my true and false in a very specific way.
462600	467440	And that leads to the fact that I have the opportunity to calculate what I think in
467440	473560	these and all conditions for true and false. There are still essays in which it is done as
473560	478520	these three laws of thinking are absolutely elementary. And then maybe a fourth,
478520	482920	that it is all basic. So, for example, biological organisms have the ability to
482920	488240	compare things and all this is derived from them. And maybe it's very deep-seated,
488240	491400	but from my point of view it doesn't seem deep-seated. I have the impression that it doesn't
491400	493320	lead very far, I can't build a mind out of it.
503560	523800	Logic cannot provide absolute truth, because it is based on unprovable axioms.
533800	538640	Then it's not 2 and 2, 4, but 2 and 2 is 5. So maybe I could take an axiom system
538640	542160	that works like that. And that's the next step you could take in your thinking,
542160	548120	that you discover that mathematics and logic are in some way popular, that you can simply
548120	553280	derive another logic from it if you use other rules. But that doesn't necessarily
553280	559120	lead far in the end, because most of these logics are not very interesting, in the sense that they
559120	563120	don't lead to interesting structures. Namely, not to structures with which I can describe
563120	569280	any reality or interesting system. And the logics, the interesting
569280	573240	structure forms with which I can describe worlds and arithmetic and so on,
573240	576080	there are relatively few of them.
589120	613240	Level 3. Truth depends on its consistent definition in a formal language. It can be
613240	615320	defined in any way we want.
615320	621640	As far as I understand it, that means that the truth is a predicate that we
621640	631560	assign entities in our language. Is that right? What do you think I don't understand then?
631560	634560	What do you think people should understand in order to reach level 3?
634560	643000	There are often discussions at a place where people say define truth. And then you can
643160	650800	refer to Stanford and Cyclopedia on philosophy, or to Wikipedia, or to a number of other websites,
650800	659160	or to certain works by logicians, for example Tarski. And what we find is that they had
659160	663480	a few approaches to logic. In philosophy, for example, there are correspondence theories
663480	668880	that say that things become true by referring to facts in the real world. But then the
668880	673800	question arises, what is actually a fact in the real world? Or there are coherence theories
673800	679440	where you say something is true, when all statements that have a claim to truth are
679440	683480	coherent with each other in a system. That means that there are no constraints.
683480	689640	And usually these systems are not very precisely defined. And the really precise
689640	696880	definitions usually exist in formal logic. And the main traditions use axioms
696880	702480	that often lead to contradictions, for example, if you look at the Goethe proof,
702480	710080	or Tarski's undefinability theorem, which is related to the Goethe set of incompleteness.
710080	717120	I think I'd rather not go into detail. I think it is more important that we first
717120	724680	become aware of what a language can say about the world. And in this tradition
724720	728160	in which we are right now, it is the case that a language cannot say anything about a world
728160	733360	outside of itself. That is different from natural languages, because the natural
733360	737760	languages ​​that we use to communicate with each other say something about a perceptual
737760	741960	world and about a mentally represented world that is not captured in the natural language at all,
741960	748160	but which can show the natural language. And we share enough of this language of thinking
748400	756400	in which we can depict perceptions, so that it is good enough to show. But in the end,
756400	760840	we cannot prove that we are talking about the same thing if we only show, because we do not know
760840	767200	what the other person is showing. And in formal logic you try to exclude that. And the hope
767200	773040	is that what exists in the perceptual world can be depicted in a logical language. And
773040	777200	it is also necessary that I get the whole world into this logical language. And
777240	783280	what Gödel has found out is that the actions he has taken lead to contradictions. That
783280	788000	means I cannot build a machine in mathematics that allows this specification of the language that
788000	794680	Gödel has used to run without this machine flying around your ears,
794680	800720	so that this computer crashes. And it is because the actions that he has used
800720	807320	to run without this machine that the logic is state-free. This means that the truth exists
807320	813480	regardless of the processing process of a program. So you do not have to be determined step by step
813480	820560	with the algorithm, but in total. This state-freedom of mathematics has a very good
820560	824640	property, which is why the mathematicians who want to have it, they allow me to deal with
824640	830560	infinity. If I have to describe everything step by step, then I know how to do it,
830720	834880	and I can decompose and put it together, i.e. conduct constructive mathematics.
834880	840360	But the disadvantage is that I never get to infinity. I can only add step by step,
840360	844960	but something like pi, for example, i.e. a number with an infinite number of places,
844960	849200	I can never completely describe in this way. And that means I can
849200	854640	create a system that runs continuously and, for example, emits a wave. And the wave
854640	860000	is a periodic process, that is, a circle that is pulled apart over time.
860480	864480	Pi has to be known until the end, so that the wave can run completely when the
864480	869680	world is continuous. And that means if I want to describe such a world in my logic,
869680	875280	then I have to deal with infinity and continuity. And that's all I can do
875280	880160	if I have functions that take up an infinite number of bits at once as an argument,
880160	884080	and then perform operations over this infinite number of bits at once, and in the end
884080	888080	also be able to output an infinite number of bits again. If I want to do this step by step,
888160	895040	it doesn't work. And what Gödel found out is that the assumptions that he had about
895040	899520	truth in this language lead to contradictions. And how did he do that?
900480	905360	He first found out that the language should not refer to the outside world,
905360	910800	but it should build everything in itself. And if the language can only refer to things in itself,
910800	914400	then you can't talk about yourself. And that's a problem. How can I
914560	918800	make the language talk about itself? And the solution is that I have to build the language
918800	924320	in itself. So the language has to be so powerful that it can build itself from scratch and that
924320	929600	performance can build itself. In order to do that, in order for a language to be executed,
929600	936080	I need a computer, a system that can, so to speak, go from one step to the next
936080	942720	step. When Gödel did that, that was at the beginning of the 30s,
943440	946880	and he had already started to think about it beforehand, there was no computer yet.
947680	952880	So he looked for one that he could take and he actually discovered one. And those were the
952880	957920	piano axioms. The piano axioms can be derived from all the natural numbers.
957920	962080	And the nice thing is that it's really just a handful of rules with which you can define
962080	966000	how they look. It's basically a kind of number stream that consists of discrete units,
966000	970240	so if one is bigger. And what you need is an operator with which you can practically
970240	974800	take one step forward and backward. And if you use it several times, then you can define the
974800	980080	addition as simply the repeated forward and backward. And the multiplication
980080	983840	can be done by repeated addition. Addition, so to speak, by counting, actually. Yes,
983840	988800	so just counting is basically this teleporting on the number stream. And I can,
988880	992800	by not just taking one step forward and backward, but teleporting. I do that by
992800	995840	defining an operation, a function, that simply consists of the
995840	1000640	automating of the forward and backward. And the multiplication is, so to speak,
1000640	1006640	the automating of the addition, by doing that several times. And the relationship
1006640	1012320	between the addition and the multiplication is the exponentialization. The cool thing is,
1012400	1021200	I can define an operation with which I project the two numbers in a room and
1021200	1025520	perform an addition in the room and then project it back, then with a logarithm,
1025520	1029360	that's the reverse of the exponentiation, and then it's equivalent. That means,
1029360	1034080	what it shows is that addition and multiplication are the same if I send them through such a
1034080	1039120	projection. And this projection is the exponentiation or the logarithm back. And
1039120	1044640	that means, I can build up the whole math step by step, just by taking these
1044640	1049600	natural numbers. And the multiplication, so to speak, when the addition is
1049600	1054160	teleporting, then it's the multiplication of zooming. I can zoom in and zoom out,
1054160	1057920	and by doing that I can make numbers that are smaller than whole numbers,
1057920	1062720	rational numbers. And a rational number I can describe as the ratio between
1063680	1071600	two whole numbers. That's a break. And that means, just a few of the whole numbers
1071600	1077120	results in any rational number. And Pythagoras hoped, that's it now,
1077120	1083920	more won't come. But then he found out, and the people in his cult, in his
1083920	1087760	Mathematica Club back then, that there are still irrational numbers. That means,
1087920	1092400	those that unfortunately cannot be described as such, for example Pi or the root of two.
1093200	1097600	And that's a terrible result, because it's the idea that you can lead the whole world from the
1097600	1103680	integers, from the whole numbers, to nothing. And the legend says that this guy,
1103680	1108560	who secretly betrayed the world, he shouldn't have betrayed it, he let him kill him,
1108560	1114160	because it was really a secret that the world shouldn't find out. And from my point of view,
1114480	1122400	Pythagoras was right. The world wasn't ready. The thing is, that the mathematicians were confused
1122400	1127200	by that, because they thought there are these irrational numbers. And the computer scientists
1127200	1131360	later discovered that there are these irrational numbers not as numbers, not as values,
1131360	1136560	but as functions. That means, I can define such a program that calculates Pi for me,
1136560	1140080	and this program does that little by little, there are more and more places for me, Pi makes me
1140160	1144400	more and more precise. But it will never go to the point that it gives me the last place.
1144960	1150160	And that also means that there can be no computer program from this point of view
1150160	1155200	that creates a world in which a perfect circle takes place. But the circles that
1155200	1159200	are described are always rounder, so to speak, but they are never completely round.
1159920	1165280	And the world in which we are is not necessarily one in which round circles exist,
1165360	1170000	but it is one in which, in the end, the resolution becomes smaller and smaller,
1170000	1175280	but never infinitely small, but at some point the world falls apart in quantum effects.
1175280	1179280	And it never becomes continuous, but it is always continuous, continuous.
1179280	1185520	And from this point of view, there is no geometry. The geometry is not a real part of
1185520	1189520	mathematics in the calculation, but something that exists only in the scope of approximation.
1189520	1194480	That is, so to speak, the mathematics of the numbers that are too big to count them.
1194480	1198400	And in an area where numbers are too big to count them, that is the world in which we
1198400	1203040	are in general, where too many molecules are there to observe them individually,
1203760	1206560	there are sometimes operators that, so to speak, converge at the limit.
1207360	1213840	And they can be calculated efficiently. And the more the numbers get bigger,
1213840	1218160	the closer you get to a certain value. And this area is exactly the geometry.
1218240	1221680	And our own brain discovers a geometry to describe the world,
1221680	1227200	a certain function with which we can describe continuous surfaces and waves in the ocean,
1227200	1232880	and things that look like a circle and where we can zoom in at will within the resolution of our brain
1232880	1237680	and can find simple algebraic expressions with which one can calculate that, so to speak.
1237680	1241200	And we can also do that in computers. And from this point of view of constructive
1241200	1245280	mathematics, the world is just like that. So there is no continuous mathematics.
1245280	1248960	But before the calculation was discovered as a principle and the computer was discovered as a
1248960	1254080	principle, mathematicians assumed that there was a continuous world.
1254080	1258400	And what Gödel discovered was that this world, which we have, of course,
1258400	1263200	foreseen and the languages ​​we have built for it, lead to contradictions.
1263200	1267520	And that has shaken him very much. And from the point of view of computer scientists,
1267520	1274880	that is not a problem at all. Now let's go back to what Gödel said.
1275520	1277040	So we were at level three.
1277040	1281840	So we were there, the other team was looking for a computer.
1281840	1284800	The computer he found were the natural numbers.
1284800	1288480	And the great thing is that he just saw that the natural numbers with which I can
1288480	1294480	calculate any things. And so I can treat them as if I had a computer.
1294480	1298640	How can I make logic with it? And his idea was that I can write down my logic with a
1298640	1302160	formal system, i.e. as symbols, letters and characters.
1302240	1306800	For example, if I make a sign for and and a sign for or and a sign for a follows from
1306800	1310960	b and then I can have a sign for variables and then I have such a small alphabet.
1310960	1314000	And I convert that into numbers.
1314000	1317840	And ASCII code has not yet been invented, i.e. this American Standard Code of
1317840	1321600	Information Interchange, which was later solved by Unicode in the computer.
1321600	1326480	That's why he converted his alphabet into powers with prime numbers.
1326480	1328240	It was mathematically super clever.
1328320	1332320	It's called Goedelization and it's one of the main points when you try to understand
1332320	1337120	the sentence by Goedel, how he exactly converted the letters into numbers.
1337120	1339120	But that's not important, ASCII works just as well.
1339120	1341120	With huge numbers, definitely pretty fast.
1341120	1344240	Yes, but basically it's exactly like the numbers in the computer.
1344240	1347280	In your computer, there are only numbers in there that are written down with b and n
1347280	1353120	and you just have an alphabet that you can convert into numbers.
1353120	1356560	And the cool thing about it is that you can only take these numbers and that you
1356640	1364640	can develop formulas or functions that calculate your logical operations.
1364640	1370640	They just say, if these and those numbers are there with which my logical expressions
1370640	1374640	are written down and I calculate them together, how can I represent arithmetic,
1374640	1378640	simple things on peony axioms, on the operations in the natural numbers
1378640	1384640	with which I can calculate how the logic continues, what is the consequence of the logic.
1384720	1388720	So he built a practical computer out of natural numbers with which he could calculate
1388720	1390720	logical expressions, which is very clever.
1390720	1392720	Turing took a different path.
1392720	1394720	Turing invented the Turing machine for this.
1394720	1400720	The Turing machine is a tape that is infinitely long and has discrete symbols on it
1400720	1402720	that can be edited with a typewriter.
1402720	1408720	And the typewriter has a series of evidence with a small table with which it says,
1408720	1412720	if I read this symbol, I replace it with the following symbol, change my own condition
1412800	1414800	and go one field to the right or left.
1414800	1416800	And with that he can describe any operation.
1416800	1422800	And this Turing machine is closer to how our current computer works,
1422800	1426800	because there is an address pointer that points to an address in the memory of the computer
1426800	1430800	and in there is not a number from a certain alphabet,
1430800	1434800	for example a byte, 256 different values.
1434800	1440800	And I can interpret them as letters or numbers and then I can define operations
1440880	1446880	with these letters and numbers that I connect in a certain way to execute any computer program.
1446880	1450880	And with any computer program I can then define any logic.
1450880	1452880	That means they came to it on different paths.
1452880	1456880	And at the same time with Turing, who was a student of Wittgenstein,
1456880	1462880	who tried to translate the natural language into such a kind of logic,
1462880	1468880	there was Alonso Church, who came up with a different formalization
1468960	1470960	of the lambda calculation.
1470960	1474960	And the lambda calculation is simply an attempt to define calculations
1474960	1476960	by searching and substituting on symbols.
1476960	1480960	And the cool thing is that with this Hütchen calculation,
1480960	1484960	or with the lambda calculation, or with the searching and substituting calculation,
1484960	1488960	you can not only do regular expressions practically,
1488960	1490960	but you can also calculate the Turing machine with it.
1490960	1494960	And vice versa, you can define the Turing machine that calculates the lambda calculation.
1494960	1497960	And you can define the Turing machine that calculates the natural numbers.
1498040	1500040	That means they are all equal.
1500040	1504040	And the idea that all these calculation systems can do exactly the same thing
1504040	1506040	is the Church-Turing thesis.
1506040	1508040	So after naming Alonso Church and Alon Turing,
1508040	1512040	who had different approaches to calculation and found that they both can do the same thing.
1512040	1516040	So that we have a practical amount of languages that can do the same thing,
1516040	1518040	that are equal in their expressive power.
1518040	1524040	Yes, and Gödel was, so to speak, a pioneer of the whole in his thinking,
1524120	1528120	who did this with the natural numbers.
1528120	1530120	And in the end he found something similar.
1530120	1532120	And he found that I can, in my language,
1532120	1536120	which calculates itself by translating it into natural languages,
1536120	1538120	express logical expressions.
1538120	1540120	And these logical expressions can be self-reliant,
1540120	1542120	because I can now build the language on myself.
1542120	1546120	And I can unfortunately have linguistic expressions that define the truth
1546120	1548120	and then say, I am wrong myself.
1548120	1552120	And that is ultimately what Tarski did,
1552200	1556200	he expressed expressions that were self-reliant and said, I am wrong myself.
1556200	1560200	And that is not compatible with our three basic rules of logic,
1560200	1562200	because now the thing is not true or false,
1562200	1564200	but it is something else.
1564200	1568200	It changes all the time, if you would evaluate it with a computer.
1568200	1572200	And for an computer scientist this is not a big problem.
1572200	1574200	The computer scientist simply says,
1574200	1576200	in my programming language,
1576200	1580200	you try to write the lambda calculation efficiently as computer programming language,
1580280	1584280	I can define the truth with true and false.
1584280	1586280	And then I have a function that calculates it for my expression.
1586280	1588280	And now I calculate it and determine
1588280	1590280	as long as I haven't calculated it, it has no value.
1590280	1592280	And if the thing is self-reliant, it has no defined value,
1592280	1594280	but it constantly changes.
1594280	1596280	So no problem, I just defined it like that.
1596280	1598280	If you don't like it, then define it differently.
1598280	1602280	And in mathematics, is that a problem, at least in the way we understand it now?
1602280	1604280	In classical mathematics, exactly.
1604280	1606280	In pre-constructive mathematics.
1606360	1608360	But there was a time in mathematics,
1608360	1610360	before the mathematics of the way came
1610360	1612360	and the computation was invented as a concept,
1612360	1614360	already mathematicians like, for example, Brewer,
1614360	1616360	who said,
1616360	1618360	what we are doing here is not fine.
1618360	1622360	It leads to contradictions that may not be cleared up.
1622360	1624360	And he said,
1624360	1626360	the problem I see is infinity.
1626360	1628360	Maybe we shouldn't allow infinity.
1628360	1630360	And then there was,
1630360	1632360	that was called intuitionism in mathematics.
1632360	1634360	And this intuitionism in mathematics
1634440	1636440	did not go very far.
1636440	1638440	Most mathematicians found what he said not convincing.
1638440	1640440	And I think that's because
1640440	1642440	he didn't express his intuition well enough.
1642440	1644440	He saw something
1644440	1646440	and tried to formalize it,
1646440	1648440	but not so that the other mathematicians
1648440	1650440	saw everything he meant.
1650440	1652440	And that is in a certain way
1652440	1654440	that it fell on our feet
1654440	1656440	only later became visible.
1656440	1658440	And where you could guess that
1658440	1660440	were things like Hilbert's Hotel.
1660440	1662440	Hilbert's Hotel is a hotel
1662520	1664520	that has a lot of rooms.
1664520	1666520	And these rooms are all fully booked.
1666520	1668520	And now a new guest comes on the way.
1668520	1670520	And the great thing is that this hotel
1670520	1672520	can accommodate the guest
1672520	1674520	because the porter simply
1674520	1676520	calls all rooms
1676520	1678520	and tells all guests,
1678520	1680520	go all one room number to the right.
1680520	1682520	And because it has an infinite number of rooms,
1682520	1684520	it's not a problem.
1684520	1686520	We now have one room free
1686520	1688520	and can accommodate the new guest.
1688520	1690520	And that's kind of very sad, isn't it?
1690600	1692600	What do we do now?
1692600	1694600	Then the porter says to all guests,
1694600	1696600	please go to the double room number of yours.
1696600	1698600	And voila, we now have
1698600	1700600	an infinite number of rooms free
1700600	1702600	and can accommodate an infinite number of buses
1702600	1704600	with new guests.
1704600	1706600	And the mathematicians,
1706600	1708600	some of them thought it was good
1708600	1710600	because it's nice when you
1710600	1712600	get something out of nothing
1712600	1714600	and even get a lot.
1714600	1716600	But other people get stomach pain from it.
1716600	1718600	Doesn't lead to problems at some point.
1718680	1720680	And one of the problems
1720680	1722680	was seen when Kantor
1722680	1724680	dealt with it.
1724680	1726680	And then he found that
1726680	1728680	when we define numbers in such a way
1728680	1730680	that it is the cardinality,
1730680	1732680	that is, the number of members of a set,
1732680	1734680	that is, how many we count,
1734680	1736680	we define number by number.
1736680	1738680	We simply say that a number is a number
1738680	1740680	of things that are in a quantity, for example.
1740680	1742680	Then we can say that the number of members
1742680	1744680	that has a quantity is the number.
1744680	1746680	And there is an empty quantity,
1746760	1748760	and that corresponds to zero.
1748760	1750760	And otherwise we get all the numbers,
1750760	1752760	all the positive numbers,
1752760	1754760	as the number of members in there.
1754760	1756760	And because of the previous backward numbers
1756760	1758760	we also get negative numbers and so on
1758760	1760760	and can then deduct the rest from it.
1760760	1762760	And that leads to problems.
1762760	1764760	If we think about it,
1764760	1766760	that the amount of all subsets
1766760	1768760	of a quantity
1768760	1770760	can also be defined
1770760	1772760	and the amount of all subsets of a quantity
1772760	1774760	is greater than the amount of all members
1774840	1776840	It is clear, right?
1776840	1778840	So for the quantity of all subsets
1778840	1780840	for example, if we have four members,
1780840	1782840	these are all combinations
1782840	1784840	that these four members can have together.
1784840	1786840	And that is always more
1786840	1788840	than there are members.
1788840	1790840	And that would mean
1790840	1792840	if we have an infinitely large quantity
1792840	1794840	and an infinitely many members,
1794840	1796840	that the quantity of all subsets
1796840	1798840	must be greater than infinity.
1798840	1800840	So there are different infinities.
1800840	1802840	And can we do that?
1802920	1804920	But what happens
1804920	1806920	if we do the total quantity?
1806920	1808920	The quantity of all subsets
1808920	1810920	also has infinitely many members
1810920	1812920	and it is a very large kind of infinity
1812920	1814920	because it also contains the quantity of subsets.
1814920	1816920	But what about the quantity
1816920	1818920	of all subsets of the total quantity?
1818920	1820920	It also has more members
1820920	1822920	than the total quantity.
1822920	1824920	But the total quantity
1824920	1826920	must also contain all of them.
1826920	1828920	The quantity of all subsets.
1828920	1830920	And that leads to the unpleasant result
1831000	1833000	that the quantity of all subsets
1833000	1835000	does not have as many members
1835000	1837000	as the quantity of all subsets.
1837000	1839000	That is, it leads to contradiction
1839000	1841000	and this contradiction cannot be solved
1841000	1843000	without further explanation,
1843000	1845000	at least not in the quantity theory
1845000	1847000	because it is defined this way.
1847000	1849000	And for computer scientists
1849000	1851000	this is not the problem
1851000	1853000	because they never have the problem
1853000	1855000	that infinitely many members are in there.
1855000	1857000	The computer scientists would point out
1857000	1859000	that this does not work at all
1859080	1861080	because they can only multiply with two.
1861080	1863080	And that means there are always only infinitely many
1863080	1865080	even if they become very large.
1865080	1867080	It will never go to infinity.
1867080	1869080	The only thing I can deal with
1869080	1871080	is unlimited, unboundedness.
1871080	1873080	And unlimited means
1873080	1875080	that I will never have a size
1875080	1877080	but that I only look at an area
1877080	1879080	where it gets bigger and bigger
1879080	1881080	and where I can still add something.
1881080	1883080	And I can find statements
1883080	1885080	about how unlimited works.
1885080	1887080	And at some point the numbers will become very large
1887160	1889160	For example, I can find out
1889160	1891160	that many corners
1891160	1895080	that are
1895080	1897080	and that have very large numbers of corners
1897080	1899080	are getting closer and closer to a circle.
1899080	1901080	And that is when I describe the ratio
1901080	1903080	of circumference and diameter
1903080	1905080	it always comes closer to a constant
1905080	1907080	that I can never determine exactly
1907080	1909080	but can always determine more precisely
1909080	1911080	the more I add corners, so to speak.
1911080	1913080	I can do that.
1913080	1915080	And the computer scientists,
1915080	1917080	that you mathematicians always wanted to have.
1917080	1919080	You have never done more than that.
1919080	1921080	And if you want to describe the world,
1921080	1923080	that is exactly what you are doing.
1923080	1925080	And if you claimed that you have always had
1925080	1927080	infinity and continuity
1927080	1929080	and you write the outside of your function on it
1929080	1931080	and they unfold your functions
1931080	1933080	and look what you have secretly done
1933080	1935080	underneath the specification,
1935080	1937080	we notice that you never had infinity
1937080	1939080	but you have always only cheated.
1939080	1941080	In your code base of mathematics
1941080	1943080	you have always only dealt with finite things
1943080	1945080	and you have always developed tricks
1945080	1947080	with which you could deal with something similar
1947080	1949080	as infinity, but there was never infinity
1949080	1951080	but always only unlimitedness.
1951080	1953080	Well, and that is possibly important
1953080	1955080	when we describe reality
1955080	1957080	because the physicists
1957080	1959080	have already checked out this code base
1959080	1961080	from mathematics in the 19th century.
1961080	1963080	So long before Gödel and Thuring
1963080	1965080	and Wittgenstein
1965080	1967080	and have infinity in there.
1967080	1969080	And that is not a big problem for the mechanics
1969080	1971080	because the mechanics only works in a nutritional way
1971080	1973080	and it is also not a problem for thermodynamics
1973080	1975080	but it is a problem for the foundation physics.
1975080	1977080	So for the basics of physics.
1977080	1979080	Because where the lowest level of reality
1979080	1981080	is to be described,
1981080	1983080	if there are continuous objects in there
1983080	1985080	and the continuous objects can not even exist
1985080	1987080	because no reasonable language can exist
1987080	1989080	that does not fly around the ears,
1989080	1991080	then it means that we have to describe
1991080	1993080	the basics of physics
1993080	1995080	in a new way.
1995080	1997080	Yes, and all because we did not
1997080	1999080	listen to Brauer or Brewer.
1999080	2001080	Yes, exactly.
2001080	2003080	Or Pythagoras.
2003080	2005080	Yes, Pythagoras.
2005080	2007080	Yes, and Pythagoras did not know yet
2007080	2009080	how to express it.
2009080	2011080	And from the current point of view, I would say
2011080	2013080	that the computer scientists express it correctly
2013080	2015080	by saying that it must be expressed
2015080	2017080	in a formal language that is predictable.
2017080	2019080	That means not only on my particular computer
2019080	2021080	but at least on theoretically
2021080	2023080	existing computers.
2023080	2025080	So on systems that
2025080	2027080	go from state to state in any way.
2029080	2031080	Music
2059080	2061080	Music
2061080	2063080	Music
2063080	2065080	Music
2065080	2067080	Music
2067080	2069080	Music
2069080	2071080	So level 3 meant
2071080	2073080	that the formal language
2073080	2075080	in which we define the truth must be consistent.
2075080	2077080	And with Gödel we have now noticed
2077080	2079080	that at least the classical mathematics
2079080	2081080	does not have this consistency
2081080	2083080	because we have statements that are self-contradictory.
2083080	2085080	Consistency means we have no contradictions,
2085080	2087080	we obviously have contradictions.
2087080	2089080	We have a system where we eventually come out
2089080	2091080	with computation
2091080	2093080	or with state transitions
2093080	2095080	within our formal language.
2095080	2097080	Exactly.
2097080	2099080	Franz, take level 4.
2099080	2101080	Because we are currently
2101080	2103080	moving from level 4 to level 5.
2103080	2105080	We are now at level 4.
2105080	2107080	We are now at level 4.
2107080	2109080	We are now at level 4.
2109080	2111080	This follows.
2111080	2113080	Gödel's theory proves
2113080	2115080	that logic is undecidable
2115080	2117080	and truth cannot generally be determined
2117080	2119080	by a mathematical procedure.
2145080	2147080	We have to build something else
2147080	2149080	that actually works.
2149080	2151080	And the thing is that this Gödel's
2151080	2153080	theory,
2153080	2155080	his two non-completeness statements,
2155080	2157080	the philosophers
2157080	2159080	in my opinion
2159080	2161080	did not really change the fabric.
2161080	2163080	And what the philosophers
2163080	2165080	find out when you look at
2165080	2167080	the literature and the discussion in philosophy
2167080	2169080	is, on the whole,
2169080	2171080	the mathematicians have proven
2171080	2173080	that mathematics is impotent to describe reality.
2173080	2175080	Or even the ultimate relativism proof.
2175080	2177080	We can't find any statements
2177080	2179080	because everything is contradictory.
2179080	2181080	That would only be true if the philosophers
2181080	2183080	went home, which they don't do.
2183080	2185080	But what the philosophers find out is
2185080	2187080	that the mathematicians cannot describe the world.
2187080	2189080	And that gives people
2189080	2191080	who don't understand mathematics
2191080	2193080	an advantage,
2193080	2195080	namely the philosophers.
2195080	2197080	That means that the philosophers have
2197080	2199080	possibly techniques that are not accessible
2199080	2201080	to the mathematicians with their formal languages
2201080	2203080	and that the mathematicians can use
2203080	2205080	to capture reality.
2205080	2207080	And that is a very interesting question.
2207080	2209080	It leads to the assumption
2209080	2211080	that someone like Roger Penrose,
2211080	2213080	similar to the philosopher Lukas
2213080	2215080	in front of him,
2215080	2217080	that our mind is able
2217080	2219080	to perform operations
2219080	2221080	that go beyond what computers can do.
2221080	2223080	So for example to discover evidence
2223080	2225080	and to lead evidence
2225080	2227080	that computers cannot lead.
2227080	2229080	But the thing is that the evidence itself,
2229080	2231080	is a step-by-step
2233080	2235080	conversion of a statement
2235080	2237080	into axioms.
2237080	2239080	That is an algorithm,
2239080	2241080	that is what Greg Chaitin says.
2241080	2243080	And of course there are a few evidences
2243080	2245080	that work a little differently,
2245080	2247080	but these evidences can be derived from such evidences.
2247080	2249080	What do you say about the
2249080	2251080	example of ZFC or ZF,
2251080	2253080	that at least
2253080	2255080	Russell's paradox
2255080	2257080	emerges and I think
2257080	2259080	you can also avoid
2259080	2261080	the paradoxes
2261080	2263080	that you just mentioned
2263080	2265080	with the amounts of potential
2265080	2267080	and the cardinalities.
2267080	2269080	But you also can't get
2269080	2271080	out of ZF, as far as I know.
2271080	2273080	And that means
2273080	2275080	that ZF is also
2275080	2277080	condemned to failure from the perspective.
2277080	2279080	They are all formal systems
2279080	2281080	that work under certain conditions
2281080	2283080	and do not work under other conditions.
2283080	2285080	And that means that
2285080	2287080	in order to bring the whole world into it,
2287080	2289080	only certain parts fit in.
2289080	2291080	And when I try to define
2291080	2293080	numbers myself,
2293080	2295080	and I am not a mathematician
2295080	2297080	or a philosopher of mathematics,
2297080	2299080	then it is quite informal. From my point of view,
2299080	2301080	the best way to define numbers
2301080	2303080	is a subsequent labeling scheme.
2303080	2305080	So it is a procedure
2305080	2307080	that allows me to
2307080	2309080	give places a new label,
2309080	2311080	in such a way that they are ordered.
2311080	2313080	And that gives me everything
2313080	2315080	that I want. It is simply an algorithm
2315080	2317080	with which I can represent
2317080	2319080	locations,
2319080	2321080	I can assign
2321080	2323080	a symbol to them.
2323080	2325080	And the way we
2325080	2327080	represent numbers in the simplest way
2327080	2329080	is that we say
2329080	2331080	zero, we don't need anything,
2331080	2333080	one we knock once, two we knock twice,
2333080	2335080	three we knock three times, four we knock
2335080	2337080	four times, and so on. And that
2337080	2339080	becomes very boring and long-winded
2339080	2341080	very quickly. And that's why
2341080	2343080	when we as humans
2343080	2345080	talk about numbers,
2345080	2347080	we try to compress them mentally.
2347080	2349080	And the compression algorithm
2349080	2351080	that we normally use for numbers
2351080	2353080	is, in our cultural circle,
2353080	2355080	that we form a tenor logarithm.
2355080	2357080	That means that we represent the size
2357080	2359080	of numbers. And that means
2359080	2361080	that we have tenors, one,
2361080	2363080	hundreds, thousands, and so on, and so on.
2363080	2365080	But we could also do it with other powers.
2365080	2367080	And the practical thing is
2367080	2369080	that we now have numbers,
2369080	2371080	we write numbers, describe them,
2371080	2373080	these regularities of numbers
2373080	2375080	in a small area, and we learn
2375080	2377080	a hash function. That's a function
2377080	2379080	that just represents a mapping,
2379080	2381080	an image from one number
2381080	2383080	to another, to make additions
2383080	2385080	in our head more efficient.
2385080	2387080	That means that we learn that
2387080	2389080	if we put two and three together, we get five.
2389080	2391080	And we learn that by heart.
2391080	2393080	And if we don't know how to do that,
2393080	2395080	we just count on our fingers. So we go back
2395080	2397080	to the knock once, twice, three times.
2397080	2399080	And by doing that, we can remember how
2399080	2401080	this hash function worked. And also
2401080	2403080	we have to learn how to transfer.
2403080	2405080	That means how to get from one number to the other.
2405080	2407080	That means we learn in simple algorithms
2407080	2409080	with which we can transfer in numbers
2409080	2411080	that we write cleverly and efficiently.
2411080	2413080	The tenor system is not optimal.
2413080	2415080	From my point of view,
2415080	2417080	we should have taken hexadecimal,
2417080	2419080	the sixteenth system.
2419080	2421080	Because the nice thing about a sixteenth system
2421080	2423080	is that it's a two-year potential.
2423080	2425080	So that you can
2425080	2427080	multiply and divide.
2427080	2429080	Another system that is very nice
2429080	2431080	is the twelfth system.
2431080	2433080	What is totally cool about the twelfth system
2433080	2435080	is that it has so many parts. That means
2435080	2437080	you can describe circles very well with it.
2437080	2439080	And that's why we still use the twelfth system
2439080	2441080	to describe the clock and the angle.
2441080	2443080	You can also describe everything else
2443080	2445080	well with the twelfth system.
2445080	2447080	The tenor system is kind of stupid.
2447080	2449080	That's just because someone says,
2449080	2451080	I have ten fingers, let's take the tenor system.
2451080	2453080	It's totally suboptimal.
2453080	2455080	It's almost as good as the tenor system.
2455080	2457080	But you can do something much better
2457080	2459080	with twelfth potential.
2459080	2461080	There is of course another point.
2461080	2463080	The twelfth system is so cool
2463080	2465080	because you can work so well
2465080	2467080	with binary logic,
2467080	2469080	with true force 1.0,
2469080	2471080	with one polarity.
2471080	2473080	And this one polarity,
2473080	2475080	this one noticeable difference
2475080	2477080	to get back to our starting point
2477080	2479080	is so great as the minimum
2479080	2481080	from which you can build everything.
2481080	2483080	It's optimal.
2483080	2485080	Maybe you shouldn't use a fourth system
2485080	2487080	or a fifth system as optimal and so on.
2487080	2489080	And apparently the optimal
2489080	2491080	is the third system,
2491080	2493080	the tenor logic.
2493080	2495080	Why is it optimal?
2495080	2497080	That was explained to me
2497080	2499080	by the physicist Ed Fredkin.
2499080	2501080	And it has something to do with
2501080	2503080	when I imagine
2503080	2505080	I'm building a memory chip
2505080	2507080	or a CPU,
2507080	2509080	so electronics,
2509080	2511080	and I try to build up the logic optimally,
2511080	2513080	then the question is
2513080	2515080	how does the size of my circuit behave,
2515080	2517080	how many more circuits do I need
2517080	2519080	if I want to form more possible states.
2521080	2523080	And this surface growth
2523080	2525080	that I need if I want to form more information
2525080	2527080	has something to do with
2527080	2529080	how many more digits I need.
2529080	2531080	For example, in the twelfth system
2531080	2533080	I can form 256 different values
2533080	2535080	with 8 digits,
2535080	2537080	with one byte.
2537080	2539080	So a three-digit decimal number
2539080	2541080	or a two-digit hexadecimal number.
2541080	2543080	The hexadecimal would be the FF
2543080	2545080	of the 16 digits.
2545080	2547080	That's what you traditionally
2547080	2549080	call ABCDEF
2549080	2551080	for the digits
2551080	2553080	from 10 to 16.
2553080	2555080	And in the tenor system
2555080	2557080	you would take
2557080	2559080	for example 0 and minus 1 and 1
2559080	2561080	or 0, 1 and 2
2561080	2563080	and build up all the numbers from them.
2563080	2565080	And the cool thing is
2565080	2567080	that it's more about the optimal growth rate.
2567080	2569080	And the optimal growth rate
2569080	2571080	is the number E.
2571080	2573080	And E is
2573080	2575080	2.81,
2575080	2577080	it goes on, I don't know exactly,
2577080	2579080	embarrassingly.
2579080	2581080	And 3 is the number
2581080	2583080	that's next to it.
2583080	2585080	And Fredkin
2585080	2587080	was a very wild physicist
2587080	2589080	who had totally crazy ideas.
2589080	2591080	But this idea
2591080	2593080	was checked.
2593080	2595080	There was a Russian
2595080	2597080	who built a computer in the Soviet Union
2597080	2599080	who built terrestrial logic
2599080	2601080	and they could show that they are more energy efficient
2601080	2603080	and have less optimal
2603080	2605080	circuits than the binary system.
2605080	2607080	But since the world started
2607080	2609080	with the binary system and already
2609080	2611080	adjusted to it and so much theory and practice
2611080	2613080	existed, we stayed with it.
2613080	2615080	I just understand father-dependency
2615080	2617080	like the tessitura layout and things like that.
2617080	2619080	Exactly.
2619080	2621080	We have to redesign at some point.
2621080	2623080	But it's also not bad, because in the end
2623080	2625080	it's equivalent.
2625080	2627080	And the fourth shows that
2627080	2629080	we haven't been able to use
2629080	2631080	this original mathematical logic
2631080	2633080	since Ergödel.
2633080	2635080	By the way, the Russellian Antinomy
2635080	2637080	maybe we can explain it for the listeners.
2637080	2639080	Do you want to?
2639080	2641080	The Russellian Antinomy
2641080	2643080	is either used as
2643080	2645080	Barbara's paradox, right?
2645080	2647080	There's the
2647080	2649080	razor, no, what's his name?
2649080	2651080	The hairdresser.
2651080	2653080	The one who razes everyone in his village
2653080	2655080	except the ones who
2655080	2657080	shave themselves.
2657080	2659080	The ones who don't...
2659080	2661080	We didn't catch that well.
2661080	2663080	The ones who don't shave themselves.
2663080	2665080	Exactly.
2665080	2667080	And then of course the question is
2667080	2669080	does he shave himself?
2669080	2671080	That's a contradiction.
2671080	2673080	Let's go through it so that we can listen
2673080	2675080	and not think about it.
2675080	2677080	Yes.
2677080	2679080	Do you want to do it or what?
2679080	2681080	Just go close to the microphone.
2681080	2683080	You don't have to...
2683080	2685080	So that you can think about it again.
2685080	2687080	If the razor razes everyone who doesn't shave
2687080	2689080	himself, it's of course the question who
2689080	2691080	razes the razor.
2691080	2693080	And if he doesn't shave himself,
2693080	2695080	then it means he's one of the instances
2695080	2697080	that are shaved, because he razes
2697080	2699080	everyone who doesn't shave himself.
2699080	2701080	And that means he razes himself, but as soon as
2701080	2703080	he razes himself, he doesn't shave himself.
2703080	2705080	It's always stupid when you express it in
2705080	2707080	words.
2707080	2709080	Of course, it's a theoretical amount.
2709080	2711080	The amount of all the amounts that don't
2711080	2713080	shave themselves.
2713080	2715080	If they shave themselves, then they
2715080	2717080	shouldn't shave themselves.
2717080	2719080	If they don't shave themselves, then they
2719080	2721080	have to shave themselves, because they
2721080	2723080	have all the amounts that don't shave
2723080	2725080	themselves.
2725080	2727080	Maybe we'll show you some graphs.
2727080	2729080	But why is that even a problem?
2729080	2731080	It's a problem because the
2731080	2733080	way that shaving is done in this
2733080	2735080	place, and with the language they express
2735080	2737080	an expression that is valid.
2737080	2739080	It considers all rules of this
2739080	2741080	language, and yet it leads
2741080	2743080	this sentence into contradictions.
2743080	2745080	It simply leads to the fact that you can't
2745080	2747080	make a valid statement about the
2747080	2749080	hairdresser himself and find out if
2749080	2751080	he's shaving himself or not.
2751080	2753080	It's not a problem for the computer scientists.
2753080	2755080	The computer scientists are familiar with the fact
2755080	2757080	that you can make specifications for
2757080	2759080	which there is no implementation.
2759080	2761080	That means that the thing doesn't even exist.
2761080	2763080	The customer wants it,
2763080	2765080	he says,
2765080	2767080	I want this and that,
2767080	2769080	and you as a computer scientist look at it
2769080	2771080	and say, I'm sorry, it doesn't work, I can
2771080	2773080	prove that it doesn't work.
2773080	2775080	And for the computer scientists it's not a problem at all,
2775080	2777080	they're used to the fact that the world works that way.
2777080	2779080	That the language, if you use it
2779080	2781080	inappropriately, leads to
2781080	2783080	things that are said in the language
2783080	2785080	that have nothing to do with the world.
2785080	2787080	And the only languages that can say
2787080	2789080	that always agree with the world
2789080	2791080	are the languages in which
2791080	2793080	the implementation itself takes place.
2793080	2795080	That is, there is a difference between
2795080	2797080	syntax and semantics, classically.
2797080	2799080	Semantics is the meaning
2799080	2801080	that the language has, and the syntax
2801080	2803080	are the rules by which the language
2803080	2805080	is calculated, that is, in which
2805080	2807080	the language is written and evaluated.
2807080	2809080	And originally
2809080	2811080	people in mathematics
2811080	2813080	assumed that
2813080	2815080	the syntax and the semantics
2815080	2817080	are related to each other, and that
2817080	2819080	they can be depicted on top of each other,
2819080	2821080	but that they are fundamentally different.
2821080	2823080	And in computer science
2823080	2825080	the semantics of a language is the
2825080	2827080	causal structure that the language has,
2827080	2829080	so what the computer program does at the end.
2829080	2831080	And the computer program always does
2831080	2833080	something, and maybe it doesn't do
2833080	2835080	what you want, but that's not the problem
2835080	2837080	of this language, that's your problem,
2837080	2839080	that you use the language in a way
2839080	2841080	that doesn't mean what the language actually means.
2841080	2843080	And from my point of view
2843080	2845080	you can interpret existence
2845080	2847080	in such a way that you say
2847080	2849080	to exist means to be implemented.
2849080	2851080	To be implemented means
2851080	2853080	that there is a system somewhere
2853080	2855080	that works in such a way
2855080	2857080	that what is described there happens.
2857080	2859080	And that is exactly that.
2859080	2861080	This is a very general term
2861080	2863080	of implementation. You could, for example, say
2863080	2865080	is there really money, or is it just
2865080	2867080	a way of talking about things?
2867080	2869080	And you could say, is there really money
2869080	2871080	in the way that money is implemented?
2871080	2873080	So there are symbol systems
2873080	2875080	in the world, and there are agreements
2875080	2877080	and meanings, there are causal structures
2877080	2879080	that lead to money being there.
2879080	2881080	And that exists from certain points of view,
2881080	2883080	and it doesn't exist from other points of view.
2883080	2885080	It depends on the language that I use
2885080	2887080	and the causal structures
2887080	2889080	that exist from the point of view
2889080	2891080	of this language. And there are certain
2891080	2893080	moments when the money doesn't exist,
2893080	2895080	where, for example,
2895080	2897080	a central bank looks at the thing
2897080	2899080	and says, it doesn't work anymore, we have to
2899080	2901080	change the currency.
2901080	2903080	And at that moment the money stops
2903080	2905080	to exist for a moment, and
2905080	2907080	then the money is reinvented,
2907080	2909080	so to speak, as a kind of software.
2909080	2911080	And compared to our
2911080	2913080	poor hairdresser,
2913080	2915080	the whole thing looks like
2915080	2917080	that the mathematician has taken the
2917080	2919080	liberty of using a language
2919080	2921080	that doesn't describe anything
2921080	2923080	in the borderline.
2923080	2925080	Or he has the claim
2925080	2927080	that it describes something, and
2927080	2929080	doesn't do anything about it.
2929080	2931080	Because there obviously can't be this hairdresser.
2931080	2933080	What the mathematician has done now,
2933080	2935080	he has just invented a rule
2935080	2937080	for a kind of game,
2937080	2939080	and this rule is not solvable, not solvable.
2939080	2941080	There can't be a game that works like that.
2941080	2943080	And we can prove that it doesn't work like that.
2943080	2945080	And that means, don't expect it to work like that.
2945080	2947080	We can't build a computer program
2947080	2949080	that works like that.
2951080	2953080	Very briefly, sorry.
2953080	2955080	So there is no hairdresser
2955080	2957080	who doesn't shave themselves.
2957080	2959080	Yes, there simply can't be one.
2959080	2961080	There can't be one, and you can't even
2961080	2963080	really imagine it, by the way.
2963080	2965080	That's also a bit counterintuitive.
2965080	2967080	You think, oh, there you imagine something
2967080	2969080	that you can't implement, but even the
2969080	2971080	imagination doesn't work. Even that breaks
2971080	2973080	in when you switch back and forth,
2973080	2975080	and you can't stabilize it.
2975080	2977080	That's also important.
2977080	2979080	If we now move on
2979080	2981080	to the next stage,
2981080	2983080	which says
2983080	2985080	that all consistent notions
2985080	2987080	of truth are computational,
2987080	2989080	and the Church-Turing thesis says that
2989080	2991080	all computational languages are equivalent.
2991080	2993080	So what that means is
2993080	2995080	that after Gürtel's theorem has proven
2995080	2997080	to us that logic is
2997080	2999080	indecisive and that truth
2999080	3001080	cannot be defined in general by a mathematical
3001080	3003080	procedure, it means that
3003080	3005080	we have simply misdefined truth.
3005080	3007080	If truth is defined in such a way
3007080	3009080	that it doesn't have to
3009080	3011080	rely on hairdressers who don't shave themselves,
3011080	3013080	then the truth has simply been misdefined.
3013080	3015080	That means we need
3015080	3017080	a different theory of truth.
3017080	3019080	We need a theory of truth that
3019080	3021080	can be described in such a way
3021080	3023080	that you can always determine what is true.
3023080	3025080	That means the truth depends on the
3025080	3027080	procedure with which you determine it.
3027080	3029080	And that means, if you claim that
3029080	3031080	something is true, you have to indicate
3031080	3033080	with which procedure you come to the truth.
3033080	3035080	And if this procedure doesn't exist
3035080	3037080	or you can't indicate it,
3037080	3039080	then you don't have a theory of truth.
3039080	3041080	How long did it take you to come to the truth?
3041080	3043080	That's the question.
3043080	3045080	Are you able to build a system
3045080	3047080	that takes endless steps?
3047080	3049080	It's not just a practical question,
3049080	3051080	but also a theoretical question.
3051080	3053080	Is there a hypothetical universe
3053080	3055080	in which mathematics exists
3055080	3057080	where you can do that? And it doesn't work.
3057080	3059080	You get the bounding,
3059080	3061080	but what you don't get is
3061080	3063080	the infinity.
3063080	3065080	You only get the infinity
3065080	3067080	if you assume it's already there.
3067080	3069080	It's like a little black box
3069080	3071080	from which the infinity comes out.
3071080	3073080	But when you open the box,
3073080	3075080	you don't see anything in there that makes sense.
3075080	3077080	In ZF, for example, there's the infinity axiom.
3077080	3079080	It's introduced by axiom.
3079080	3081080	Exactly. That's the box you take
3081080	3083080	and you look at a real universe
3083080	3085080	as an observer.
3085080	3087080	Real doesn't necessarily mean physical,
3087080	3089080	but some hypothetical.
3089080	3091080	For example, in a computer language,
3091080	3093080	I build a hypothetical computer.
3093080	3095080	What would it look like
3095080	3097080	if I implemented it?
3097080	3099080	What would the subroutine look like?
3099080	3101080	That's not possible.
3125080	3127080	We're still at level 4-5.
3127080	3129080	We're going over to level 5.
3129080	3131080	We refer to the mathematical logic
3131080	3133080	that Götel believed in.
3133080	3135080	And we say to Götel
3135080	3137080	that the vibration doesn't come from
3137080	3139080	the fact that you realized
3139080	3141080	that mathematics doesn't work,
3141080	3143080	but that you used the wrong mathematics.
3143080	3145080	There's a mathematics that works,
3145080	3147080	and that mathematics is
3147080	3149080	the constructive mathematics.
3149080	3151080	The modern name for constructive mathematics
3151080	3153080	is computation.
3153080	3155080	We've already talked about infinity.
3155080	3157080	It's about the fact that
3157080	3159080	you can't observe infinity.
3159080	3161080	Every observation is necessarily
3161080	3163080	a discrete, finite bit vector.
3163080	3165080	You can't observe infinitely
3165080	3167080	and then close it off.
3167080	3169080	It doesn't work.
3169080	3171080	Empirically, you can't get it in.
3171080	3173080	You can't construct it.
3173080	3175080	You can't start to formulate
3175080	3177080	or build something and get it done.
3177080	3179080	If it's infinite,
3179080	3181080	it can't be finished by definition.
3181080	3183080	If it's infinite, then you get
3183080	3185080	contradictions like the razor paradox
3185080	3187080	that we just talked about
3187080	3189080	and like the problem of holding.
3189080	3191080	I wanted to talk about holding.
3191080	3193080	The question is, why is holding
3193080	3195080	a problem at all?
3195080	3197080	What Thuring tried to do
3197080	3199080	was to train
3199080	3201080	classical mathematics
3201080	3203080	into computer programs.
3203080	3205080	But that also means
3205080	3207080	that I have computer programs
3207080	3209080	that may have to run infinitely long.
3209080	3211080	Where I can't determine
3211080	3213080	the number of steps.
3213080	3215080	The holding problem says
3215080	3217080	that there is no algorithm
3217080	3219080	that can determine for any
3219080	3221080	unknown algorithm
3221080	3223080	if it ever comes to an end.
3223080	3225080	Whether you stop after an infinite number of steps
3225080	3227080	or stay in an infinite loop.
3227080	3229080	You can prove
3229080	3231080	that the holding problem
3231080	3233080	is due to
3233080	3235080	reductio ad absurdum,
3235080	3237080	through negation
3237080	3239080	of the holding problem.
3239080	3241080	If you assume
3241080	3243080	that there is a computer
3243080	3245080	that solves the holding problem,
3245080	3247080	then you could build
3247080	3249080	a loop
3249080	3251080	that determines
3251080	3253080	that the algorithm is terminated.
3253080	3255080	Then the thing runs into an infinite loop.
3255080	3257080	If I build the thing
3257080	3259080	on the next step,
3259080	3261080	to solve the holding problem,
3261080	3263080	then the assumption that
3263080	3265080	I can solve the holding problem leads
3265080	3267080	to the fact that I can never build a computer
3267080	3269080	that solves the holding problem
3269080	3271080	for mathematical abstract reasons.
3271080	3273080	In reality,
3273080	3275080	the holding problem
3275080	3277080	does not apply to computer science.
3277080	3279080	The thing is that
3279080	3281080	normally my program
3281080	3283080	should come to an end
3283080	3285080	after an infinite number of steps.
3285080	3287080	I know how many there are.
3287080	3289080	It should be finished today.
3289080	3291080	Or it should be finished before I die.
3291080	3293080	That means I can just let the computer run
3293080	3295080	until it has a result.
3295080	3297080	If it doesn't, I just stop.
3297080	3299080	In our own consciousness,
3299080	3301080	we can only perform
3301080	3303080	so many operations in our cells
3303080	3305080	and neurons.
3305080	3307080	If we don't have a result
3307080	3309080	after a certain time,
3309080	3311080	we can't remember what happened before
3311080	3313080	because we didn't live at that time
3313080	3315080	or were already dead
3315080	3317080	or asleep.
3317080	3319080	We always have to assume
3319080	3321080	that we can only perform
3321080	3323080	until we have the result.
3323080	3325080	The results of the holding problem
3325080	3327080	are of theoretical interest,
3327080	3329080	not practical.
3329080	3331080	The theoretical interest
3331080	3333080	has to do with the basics of logic
3333080	3335080	or the basics of mathematics
3335080	3337080	when I try to translate them into computer science.
3337080	3339080	The holding problem is that
3339080	3341080	there are classes of functions
3341080	3343080	that are allowed in mathematics,
3343080	3345080	but that are not determinable in computer science.
3345080	3347080	I can't build a machine
3347080	3349080	or a theory that is able
3349080	3351080	to calculate these functions.
3351080	3353080	The problem is that
3353080	3355080	before the computer was invented
3355080	3357080	or this concept was invented,
3357080	3359080	people thought that
3359080	3361080	the evaluation of logical expressions
3361080	3363080	or the mathematics and interpretation
3363080	3365080	of language worked.
3365080	3367080	They thought that they could do more
3367080	3369080	than what any interpretation system could do.
3379080	3381080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3381080	3383080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3383080	3385080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3385080	3387080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3387080	3389080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3389080	3391080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3391080	3393080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3393080	3395080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3395080	3397080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3397080	3399080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3399080	3401080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3403080	3405080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3405080	3407080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3408080	3410080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3410080	3412080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3412080	3414080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3414080	3416080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3416080	3418080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3418080	3420080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3420080	3422080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3422080	3424080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3424080	3426080	Let's go back to the beginning.
3426080	3431080	I went to the Berlin School of Mind and Brain
3431080	3433080	for some time.
3433080	3435080	I worked on 손역은 because I was
3435080	3440080	that didn't fit into the project that took place at the time.
3440080	3445080	But at the same time, I found out that I was allowed to learn
3445080	3450080	and organized a seminar on the philosophy of computationalism,
3450080	3454080	the basics of representation in computationalism.
3454080	3458080	Among other things, I went through the lambda calculus with the students,
3458080	3462080	step by step, how it works. It's not that difficult to understand.
3462080	3465080	The Turing machine, step by step, is also not that difficult to understand,
3465080	3468080	except for the lowest basics and why they are equivalent.
3468080	3472080	After that, I asked the students what they think is more powerful.
3472080	3476080	A majority of the students in the vote said that the lambda calculus is more powerful
3476080	3480080	because it can make things parallel and the Turing machine only sequentially.
3480080	3483080	The thing is, however, that time doesn't matter at all,
3483080	3485080	but I can represent them one by one.
3485080	3489080	And there are no statements about how fast it runs in the world.
3489080	3492080	In fact, they are exactly the same because I can represent them
3492080	3495080	one by one with a very simple procedure.
3495080	3500080	And this realization that all computational systems can do the same,
3500080	3502080	that's the Church-Turing thesis.
3502080	3506080	But that means that I can use any of these systems
3506080	3509080	to describe the entire reality.
3509080	3515080	That means I can just take a Turing machine and put it into nothing,
3515080	3518080	and then the whole universe runs on it.
3518080	3521080	And that brings us to the next point.
3521080	3527080	That means, every consistently described universe is equivalent
3527080	3530080	to some kind of Turing machine,
3530080	3534080	which is actually a finite but possibly unbounded automaton,
3534080	3539080	but we can never know what has put a Turing machine into the void.
3539080	3543080	Maybe we should briefly talk about the term automaton.
3543080	3547080	The automaton is a kind of calculation to be defined
3547080	3549080	by discrete state transitions.
3549080	3552080	And the cellular automaton is very well known.
3552080	3557080	The cellular automaton is a thing that uses cells next to each other.
3557080	3560080	They can be, for example, in 1D or 2D.
3560080	3564080	And then there is a rule that says that the configuration
3564080	3569080	of the states of the cells goes into the next configurations.
3570080	3574080	A well-known automaton is, for example, the Game of Life.
3574080	3578080	It is a very nice automaton that was discovered by John Conway,
3578080	3580080	and it is two-dimensional.
3580080	3583080	And that means that it is just a little box thing
3583080	3586080	where each cell, like on a little box of paper,
3586080	3588080	has eight neighbors around it.
3588080	3592080	So three times three is exactly the eight neighbors of the middle cell.
3592080	3595080	And each cell can have exactly one of two states,
3595080	3598080	namely living or dead, that is, filled or empty.
3598080	3605080	We can say in the Game of Life that if a cell has more than three neighbors,
3605080	3609080	then it dies of infection.
3609080	3614080	And if there are two or three, then you stay alive.
3614080	3617080	Because if there are exactly three, you come to life.
3617080	3619080	If there are less than two, more than three, you die.
3619080	3622080	Exactly, so actually only two rules and the other implicit is already in there.
3622080	3626080	And these rules lead to the fact that if you have a random configuration of cells
3626080	3631080	that they start blubbering and that after a certain time patterns are created there.
3631080	3635080	And these patterns are always periodic at the end.
3635080	3641080	And in the boring case, the period is one or zero.
3641080	3644080	And that means that nothing is there anymore.
3644080	3647080	But the patterns can also have relatively complex periods.
3647080	3649080	So very long, complicated patterns are created.
3649080	3652080	And sometimes it takes a long time for them to go over to such a periodic pattern.
3652080	3657080	And you can build very interesting structures in this world of the Game of Life,
3657080	3659080	for example the so-called gliders.
3659080	3663080	The glider is a kind of particle that plants itself.
3663080	3668080	That is, it is a pattern that changes its surroundings in such a way
3668080	3673080	that new cells come to life on its edge and die on the opposite edge of the cell.
3673080	3676080	And this is how this glider walks through the world one by one.
3676080	3679080	And the gliders that you see there, they are called gliders.
3680080	3685080	And the gliders that you have discovered, they move horizontally or vertically.
3685080	3690080	And from the gliders you can build structures that exchange information.
3690080	3696080	For example, computers, where the glider is a kind of bit that flies through the area
3696080	3701080	and then triggers a circuit that generates new gliders,
3701080	3704080	a glider cannon that periodically shoots new gliders.
3704080	3708080	And if you aim the glider cannon correctly, then you can shoot broken glider cannons
3708080	3713080	or shoot again functionally and can practically build transistor logic with it
3713080	3718080	and then build a new Game of Life on the next level, for example.
3718080	3723080	If you zoom out, it looks like the Game of Life and re-images itself.
3723080	3725080	The Game of Life is Turing complete.
3725080	3729080	And there was a competition between Steven Wolfram and Marvin Minsky
3729080	3733080	about what is the easiest cellular machine that is Turing complete.
3733080	3740080	And it is also such a simple rule that can be defined in one-dimensionally automated machines.
3740080	3746080	And that means that you look at the initial state as the tape of a Turing machine
3746080	3750080	and the rule that is applied on it is what describes how the evolution is going on.
3750080	3754080	Then you can convert that into any computer.
3755080	3758080	Who won? Was it Wolfram and Rohan?
3758080	3762080	They never really agreed because it depends on what you expect.
3763080	3769080	With Wolfram it was like this, that one of his employees published the machines that they had found all over the place
3769080	3771080	before Wolfram did that.
3771080	3775080	Wolfram was so smart that he sued the employee for copyright infringement.
3775080	3778080	I think in very rare cases in the history of mathematics,
3778080	3783080	where a mathematician was sued for copyright for publishing a proof,
3783080	3788080	which somehow made many people very angry at Wolfram.
3822080	3826080	When you talk about Turing complete systems or abstract computers,
3826080	3830080	they are actually only abstract definitions of computations,
3830080	3833080	so what this system can theoretically do.
3833080	3837080	And it turns out that such systems, Turing complete systems like the Game of Life
3837080	3842080	or the abstract computer that Goethe came up with about the piano axioms or a Turing machine,
3842080	3845080	what is the difference between these systems?
3845080	3848080	Turing complete systems like the Game of Life or the abstract computer
3848080	3852080	that Goethe came up with about the piano axioms or a Turing machine,
3852080	3856080	which is also an abstract thing, or lambda calculus, and the rules of Wolfram.
3856080	3859080	In the end, they are any pattern generator.
3859080	3862080	So all patterns that can be generated can be generated from these things.
3862080	3866080	A pattern is defined as a lot of recognizable differences.
3866080	3870080	So patterns are discrete, finite structures, but they can be very large.
3870080	3875080	And now you are at a point where you realize that when you talk about the universe,
3875080	3878080	you are actually only talking about a large collection of recognizable differences,
3878080	3881080	so a large collection of patterns.
3881080	3885080	And then you can say, well, the universe for me is the amount of all my observations,
3885080	3890080	in my case also the amount of all observations from other people or measuring instruments and so on and so forth.
3890080	3895080	But in the end, what you mean by the universe, when you refer to the observation,
3895080	3899080	is a very, very large and yet finally discrete bit vector.
3899080	3902080	And this can be produced by a Turing complete system.
3902080	3906080	That is, you are on the level that you simply say, well, from my perspective,
3906080	3911080	the necessary condition for the amount of all my observations is a Turing complete system,
3911080	3916080	some pattern generator. And from my perspective, the universe is a random pattern generator.
3916080	3919080	So that was my step. But I don't know why that's there.
3919080	3923080	That would be in the field of metaphysics, where cool people like Wolfram, for example,
3923080	3929080	dare to get out of the field of metaphysics and really want to explain.
3929080	3933080	Wolfram's idea of physics was, instead of, so to speak,
3933080	3938080	to reverse-engineer physics, that is, to transfer our observations from the world
3938080	3943080	into a series of formulas and then simplify these formulas so far
3943080	3946080	that you have less and less at the end. Why is that?
3946080	3949080	Standard model is practically half a page full of formulas,
3949080	3952080	where you need a long time to understand the individual formulas, what they mean,
3952080	3955080	but it's still half a page code, so to speak.
3955080	3959080	And Wolfram's idea is, of course, that it's still way too long.
3959080	3963080	There has to be a simple rule from which everything is derived.
3963080	3965080	And what do I think of this simple rule?
3965080	3969080	I could simply number all the cellular machines that exist
3969080	3973080	and search for something like our universe at the end.
3973080	3976080	And then I would find out which of these machines we are in.
3977080	3980080	And the question that is still open, the spoiler,
3980080	3983080	Wolfram has not been able to find these machines so far.
3983080	3988080	And the idea is, I think, brilliant to say that we are trying to search for physics from another series,
3988080	3991080	that we are trying to say all possible laws of the series,
3991080	3994080	through which the world can be expressed.
3994080	3999080	This is of course very difficult, because it could be that it is difficult
3999080	4002080	to simulate a computer program that comes out clearly over the clock,
4002080	4005080	simply because you have to look at so many elements at once.
4005080	4010080	And the other question is, where does this Turing machine come from now?
4010080	4013080	So what has this Turing machine done in the lesson?
4013080	4015080	Why is there something rather than nothing?
4015080	4019080	And that is the question that you are confronted with at this level.
4019080	4022080	And this question has no obvious answer.
4022080	4024080	By the way, with all theories that are still there,
4024080	4026080	even if people say they find computation strange,
4026080	4030080	so far everyone has had the problem that you need any first cause,
4030080	4033080	the first movement or something, why is there nothing?
4033080	4037080	Exactly. And Christianity was not so helpful,
4037080	4044080	because many of these considerations, which played a role in defining a civilization spirit,
4044080	4052080	so a total god, god is, I think we atheists often don't really understand what god means,
4052080	4059080	but god is a technical term, and god is something similar to the human self,
4059080	4064080	the self is a technical term, the self is a model of a person that is created in our brain
4064080	4069080	about ourselves, and that we use to move and understand ourselves in the world.
4069080	4072080	And this includes, for example, that we perceive ourselves as human beings,
4072080	4076080	and that we have a biography, and that we make decisions ourselves,
4076080	4080080	and have expectations of the future, and have certain identifications.
4080080	4084080	And all of this is in a self-model and definitely what kind of agent we are,
4084080	4087080	so this personal, human self.
4087080	4090080	And this is not identical to our consciousness.
4090080	4094080	Our consciousness is also a kind of self, but it is a more minimal self,
4094080	4098080	in which practically an observer perceives himself while observing,
4098080	4101080	even before he has a language or something else,
4101080	4104080	and this minimal self is a kind of attention self,
4104080	4111080	where practically the observer perceives himself as the thing that has attention.
4111080	4115080	And the personal self is already much more charged up, has much more properties,
4115080	4121080	it has a first-person perspective and the identification with the way we are in the world.
4121080	4128080	And besides this personal self, from which exactly one normally exists per human spirit,
4128080	4131080	then you have such a multiple personality disorder,
4131080	4137080	there are also selfs that can exist beyond several spirits, and they are called gods.
4137080	4143080	So gods are clusters of agentic properties that stabilize,
4143080	4149080	and which, for example via memes or through interactions with each other,
4149080	4155080	or through archetypes, that is, they are discovered regardless of each other on different spirits,
4155080	4159080	but because of the same observer, the same world and the same mathematical principles,
4159080	4166080	they lead to the fact that practically effective agents are created that exist beyond a single spirit.
4166080	4172080	And political societies are some in which the problem of coordination
4172080	4177080	over individual self-sufficient agents is solved in such a way that spirits are supported
4177080	4180080	in their formation beyond the different spirits.
4180080	4184080	That is, it is not only the case that the individual people in the world interact with each other,
4184080	4187080	but also selfs that do not define themselves as human beings,
4187080	4192080	but are there as principles beyond human beings, for example social principles.
4192080	4197080	For example, there is a god of harvest that leads people to coordinate themselves
4197080	4200080	so that they experience themselves as an agent who now brings in the harvest,
4200080	4203080	and they all have to serve the individual spirit, the individual body.
4203080	4209080	And in monotheism it is the case that all these gods are made illegal, forbidden,
4209080	4213080	and say, no, there is only one god, and that is the god of our civilization.
4213080	4216080	Originally for the Hebrews it is the god of the tribe,
4216080	4220080	and for the Catholics it is the attempt to transfer the Roman Empire,
4220080	4224080	which was relatively rational, but also partly political,
4224080	4229080	into a kind of cult, and they branched or forged it from the Hebrew cult,
4229080	4236080	and complemented it with Jesus, the Middle Eastern gnostic,
4236080	4239080	who was killed by the Romans at the time because he was too arrogant.
4239080	4242080	They take him in to define the aesthetics of this new cult,
4242080	4244080	and then they define a single god.
4244080	4248080	And we find this single god, each one of us,
4248080	4251080	by searching for the perfect god,
4251080	4256080	so after the one who is created by the fact that everyone does what should be done best.
4256080	4260080	If you think about it, you can deduce from it what this agent looks like.
4260080	4263080	Is that what is created when everyone does what should be done best,
4263080	4267080	an agent at all, a control system for future conditions?
4267080	4269080	Yes, otherwise it would be less perfect.
4269080	4272080	So it should be something that performs control functions,
4272080	4275080	and it should be the perfect thing that performs control functions.
4275080	4278080	And compared to the Hebrew god, who is then, for example,
4278080	4281080	jealous and angry, and makes a lot of decisions,
4281080	4285080	from which you ask yourself, is it optimal to use a shark shark rain,
4285080	4287080	or to kill the newborns, or something like that.
4287080	4290080	This is expanded in Christianity, so to speak.
4290080	4295080	Then we think, no, we are not looking for what this tribe thought back then,
4295080	4298080	what this entity then did, or not,
4298080	4300080	but we think about what would happen in the ideal case,
4300080	4302080	what is the perfect system.
4302080	4307080	And the philosophers of Catholicism, especially Thomas Aquinas,
4307080	4310080	thought very seriously about how to specify this god.
4310080	4313080	And he put a number of things into the specifications
4313080	4316080	that do not belong in there from my point of view.
4316080	4320080	And I say that now as someone who has no idea about theology
4320080	4323080	and who only says it from his personal point of view,
4323080	4326080	without any great demand to get it right.
4326080	4329080	But the idea that the perfect god,
4329080	4332080	even the one who created the universe,
4332080	4335080	is more or less an empirical question for me,
4335080	4337080	that I can decide a priori.
4337080	4339080	So to consider whether God is an agent,
4339080	4341080	if I try to see him as an optimal agent,
4341080	4344080	which results in everyone who discovers him serving him,
4344080	4347080	I see that one can derive this a priori,
4347080	4350080	under certain circumstances, without any conditions.
4350080	4355080	But the idea that our universe was created by him,
4355080	4358080	that does not really show up.
4358080	4361080	From my point of view, it is true that the monotheistic god
4361080	4363080	was discovered only 6,000 years ago,
4363080	4365080	and before that there are no traces of it.
4365080	4369080	And that means that it is in its form a human discovery.
4369080	4372080	And this human discovery is possibly not an absolute discovery,
4372080	4374080	but has had certain conditions
4374080	4377080	that people had to develop certain cultures
4377080	4379080	that brought them to these ideas.
4379080	4382080	And this entity may actually only arise
4382080	4385080	through the interaction of people
4385080	4388080	who discover this entity and want to serve it.
4388080	4390080	That means as a civilisation spirit,
4390080	4394080	not as a creator god who created a physical universe.
4394080	4396080	So there is a trick,
4396080	4399080	that you try to bring together the unknown
4399080	4402080	with an answer that is comfortable,
4402080	4405080	and the one with this god of civilisation,
4405080	4409080	with whom you try to discipline and harmonize your population,
4409080	4412080	and to make your behaviour coherent.
4412080	4414080	And I think that's how you get into trouble,
4414080	4417080	if you don't bring this back to an empirical question.
4418080	4421080	Practically, this also leads to logical contradictions,
4421080	4423080	because this god is not structureless,
4423080	4426080	he has properties, so that he can be effective.
4426080	4428080	He has to be structural.
4428080	4430080	And that means that he is not free of conditions.
4430080	4433080	And he is not suitable as a condition for the physical universe.
4433080	4436080	So if he is a condition for the physical universe,
4436080	4439080	then the physical universe becomes a kind of simulation
4439080	4441080	that is created by him, is conceivable.
4441080	4444080	Maybe our god is a being
4444080	4447080	that existed in the next higher universe,
4447080	4450080	and created this universe as a kind of computer simulation.
4450080	4452080	But that doesn't change the fact,
4452080	4454080	that this next higher universe
4454080	4456080	also has to be conceivable in some language.
4456080	4459080	In the broadest sense, with some mathematical language.
4459080	4461080	And that's where this god has to fall out.
4461080	4464080	How do I get this precondition-free universe
4464080	4467080	where the world is created by itself?
4467080	4471080	And this question, why is there anything at all,
4471080	4476080	is a question that I haven't seen a satisfying answer for a long time.
4476080	4480080	And for me it was the point where I realized,
4480080	4482080	okay, now it's working.
4482080	4486080	When I read a text by the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce,
4486080	4489080	he wrote about existence and non-existence
4489080	4491080	in this short chapter.
4491080	4494080	And he states that you can describe the non-existence
4494080	4497080	by zero and the existence by one.
4497080	4499080	And then he says,
4499080	4501080	you could also describe the non-existence
4501080	4503080	by the negation of existence,
4503080	4505080	so by minus one.
4505080	4507080	So there is one way to exist
4507080	4509080	and two ways not to exist.
4509080	4511080	And I read that and thought,
4511080	4513080	that's nonsense.
4513080	4515080	You didn't discover that there is one way to exist
4515080	4517080	and two ways not to exist,
4517080	4519080	but you found labels
4519080	4521080	for existence and non-existence.
4521080	4523080	And there are infinitely many,
4523080	4525080	so unlimitedly many,
4525080	4527080	that you can create.
4527080	4529080	And what you used
4529080	4531080	and put forward for that
4531080	4533080	is a system of numbers.
4533080	4535080	And the piano axiom,
4535080	4537080	this system of numbers,
4537080	4539080	is so powerful that you can build
4539080	4541080	a whole universe out of it,
4541080	4543080	so it's not conditional.
4543080	4545080	That means you trick yourself,
4545080	4547080	you pretend that zero and one
4547080	4549080	are already there out of nothing.
4549080	4551080	And from that you talk about existence
4551080	4553080	and non-existence.
4553080	4555080	But can we talk about non-existence
4555080	4557080	out of existence?
4557080	4559080	Actually not, right?
4559080	4561080	That means we can't talk about existence
4561080	4563080	and non-existence
4563080	4565080	at the lowest level of the universe
4565080	4567080	because there is nothing there.
4567080	4569080	That means the universe itself
4569080	4571080	outside of itself
4571080	4573080	is not determined
4573080	4575080	about its existence and non-existence.
4575080	4577080	It doesn't know if it exists or not.
4577080	4579080	And that means,
4579080	4581080	if I assume it's conditional,
4581080	4583080	that the default,
4583080	4585080	is not that the universe doesn't exist
4585080	4587080	or that there is nothing there,
4587080	4589080	but that you can't know
4589080	4591080	if it exists or not.
4591080	4593080	If the universe is possible,
4593080	4595080	that means there is an existing
4595080	4597080	and non-existent branch.
4597080	4599080	And the non-existent branch
4599080	4601080	doesn't contain any observers
4601080	4603080	who will complain.
4603080	4605080	And all the observers who have complaints
4605080	4607080	are us in the existing branch.
4607080	4609080	And what we have to explain now
4609080	4611080	is that after we have
4611080	4613080	derived from the existence
4613080	4615080	and the fact that
4615080	4617080	there is nothing in the universe
4617080	4619080	that prevents that,
4619080	4621080	why are certain things there
4621080	4623080	and other things not there?
4623080	4625080	Why does the universe
4625080	4627080	have this structure
4627080	4629080	and not everything?
4631080	4633080	And the simplest answer is
4633080	4635080	that the universe is simply everything.
4635080	4637080	That means that the universe
4637080	4639080	is possibly used by all machines.
4639080	4641080	How does it look exactly?
4641080	4643080	We can take one more step
4643080	4645080	before the Turing machine.
4645080	4647080	The Turing machine
4647080	4649080	that we normally use,
4649080	4651080	this tape with the one head reader,
4651080	4653080	is a way to talk about
4653080	4655080	the calculation.
4655080	4657080	And it has an interesting feature,
4657080	4659080	it has an exact sequence state
4659080	4661080	for every starting state.
4661080	4663080	And this sequence state
4663080	4665080	is deterministic,
4665080	4667080	that means there is no coincidence,
4667080	4669080	but when the same starting state is
4669080	4671080	exactly in the same sequence state.
4671080	4673080	The difference between deterministic
4673080	4675080	and non-deterministic functions
4675080	4677080	from this point of view would be
4677080	4679080	that a non-deterministic function
4679080	4681080	that can give a different result every time,
4681080	4683080	would be a deterministic function
4683080	4685080	every time under the same conditions
4685080	4687080	that gives the same result.
4687080	4689080	And the other feature
4689080	4691080	besides the determinism of the Turing machine
4691080	4693080	is that it is linear.
4693080	4695080	That means that every state
4695080	4697080	has a different function.
4697080	4699080	But I could also define it differently.
4699080	4701080	I could make one that is stochastic,
4701080	4703080	that happens to go into one of several
4703080	4705080	whether it is linear or non-linear.
4705080	4707080	But you need coincidence.
4707080	4709080	Yes, but the coincidence only means
4709080	4711080	that I have to define a function
4711080	4713080	that gives me a different result every time.
4713080	4715080	And that means that it cannot be
4715080	4717080	compressed over time,
4717080	4719080	but it is different every time,
4719080	4721080	and you can do that,
4721080	4723080	it just gets very long.
4723080	4725080	I could also make it branched.
4727080	4729080	If I make a Turing machine
4729080	4731080	that does not have one subsequent state,
4731080	4733080	but has several subsequent states,
4733080	4735080	then it will have more branches
4735080	4737080	in every state, so to speak.
4739080	4741080	And that is, in the mathematical sense,
4741080	4743080	a non-deterministic Turing machine.
4745080	4747080	That is one that is not so defined
4747080	4749080	that I only have one subsequent state,
4749080	4751080	but is less constrained.
4751080	4753080	That means it can go into several,
4753080	4755080	because you can't only decide for one.
4757080	4759080	It's a bit of an unhappy label,
4759080	4761080	because non-deterministic sounds
4761080	4763080	a bit esoteric as if it's a real coincidence,
4763080	4765080	but you can't define it at all,
4765080	4767080	observe, formalize.
4767080	4769080	Yes, we can define the real coincidence
4769080	4771080	by simply saying that our function
4771080	4773080	must or can give us a different value every time.
4775080	4777080	But I don't quite understand that,
4777080	4779080	because the real coincidence
4779080	4781080	is the problem that you have to get
4781080	4783080	something out of nothing.
4783080	4785080	No, you don't have to.
4785080	4787080	There is, for example,
4787080	4789080	if you want to decode things,
4789080	4791080	the problem is that you can
4791080	4793080	get the key out
4793080	4795080	with mathematical operations,
4795080	4797080	which regularity you have
4797080	4799080	executed in mathematics,
4799080	4801080	to connect the key
4801080	4803080	with the text,
4803080	4805080	so that you get the result.
4805080	4807080	But there is a trick with which
4807080	4809080	you can get the key out,
4809080	4811080	and that is the one-time-pad.
4811080	4813080	The one-time-pad uses a key
4813080	4815080	that is just as long as the text you want to decode.
4815080	4817080	And you exchange it
4817080	4819080	so that you only use it once.
4819080	4821080	That means you meet
4821080	4823080	with your secret agent at the beginning,
4823080	4825080	and you both use a key
4825080	4827080	that you generate in such a way
4827080	4829080	that no one else can know,
4829080	4831080	and it's only used once.
4831080	4833080	And each of you has a copy of this key.
4833080	4835080	And you calculate this key
4835080	4837080	together with your text every time.
4837080	4839080	And everything you used,
4839080	4841080	you throw away and burn it.
4841080	4843080	And you always know exactly
4843080	4845080	where you are on your blog,
4845080	4847080	where you have this long key on it.
4847080	4849080	And because this function
4849080	4851080	is not known to anyone else,
4851080	4853080	so you interact with the other universe
4853080	4855080	until you let it interact,
4855080	4857080	this function, from the point of view
4857080	4859080	of every observer, is absolutely random.
4859080	4861080	Okay, yes, of course, from the point of view
4861080	4863080	of every observer anyway,
4863080	4865080	who often solve themselves
4865080	4867080	and think that basically
4867080	4869080	in the substrate universe
4869080	4871080	there are undetermined things
4871080	4873080	and there you don't need anything.
4873080	4875080	Yes, but that just means
4875080	4877080	in practice there is a bubble
4877080	4879080	that is hermetically separated
4879080	4881080	from the rest of the universe
4881080	4883080	and is exactly the same format.
4883080	4885080	There is no difference.
4885080	4887080	If we formalize this in a language,
4887080	4889080	it is by chance nothing else
4889080	4891080	than a source that was
4891080	4893080	nothing in connection with the universe
4893080	4895080	and there are values that have not been known to you.
4895080	4897080	Okay, I'll buy one.
4897080	4899080	So in this respect this is not a problem.
4899080	4901080	But the non-deterministic Turing machine
4901080	4903080	was chosen for another reason,
4903080	4905080	because it is deterministic.
4905080	4907080	That is, if I have a machine
4907080	4909080	that goes into several states at the same time,
4909080	4911080	that goes in parallel,
4911080	4913080	there is no coincidence in it,
4913080	4915080	but it just goes into all these states.
4915080	4917080	The non-determinism comes about
4917080	4919080	by the fact that when I am calculated
4919080	4921080	in the Turing machine,
4921080	4923080	I do not know in which branch I am.
4923080	4925080	Copies of me are in all other branches,
4925080	4927080	but there is no criterion
4927080	4929080	that tells me in which branch I go in,
4929080	4931080	because these branches
4931080	4933080	just all exist in parallel.
4933080	4935080	They are not somehow privileged from each other.
4935080	4937080	That is, it is not the case that
4937080	4939080	one is calculated more than the other
4939080	4941080	or has any properties that
4941080	4943080	differ from the others,
4943080	4945080	which you can check by looking at the others,
4945080	4947080	because the branches do not see each other
4947080	4949080	The thing that is a coincidence,
4949080	4951080	so to speak, only affects you
4951080	4953080	if you are the observer
4953080	4955080	who is calculated by the machine.
4955080	4957080	As a student, I got to know this
4957080	4959080	non-deterministic Turing machine
4959080	4961080	as an undergrad,
4961080	4963080	in basic studies,
4963080	4965080	in complexity theory,
4965080	4967080	as a method to measure
4967080	4969080	how the complexity of algorithms is.
4969080	4971080	I saw this as unimportant,
4971080	4973080	because I can emulate this
4973080	4975080	non-deterministic Turing machine
4975080	4977080	by simply giving the normal Turing machine
4977080	4979080	a stack, and every time
4979080	4981080	I do a branch,
4981080	4983080	I add the condition to the stack,
4983080	4985080	and later I go back to this point
4985080	4987080	and then have to calculate
4987080	4989080	the branch in the other direction.
4989080	4991080	This makes it completely equivalent.
4991080	4993080	The disadvantage is that
4993080	4995080	this non-deterministic Turing machine
4995080	4997080	of course needs more memory.
4997080	4999080	I have to calculate the stack
4999080	5001080	and need more calculation steps.
5001080	5003080	And vice versa,
5003080	5005080	it is also equivalent.
5005080	5007080	I can calculate the non-deterministic Turing machine
5007080	5009080	by simply ensuring
5009080	5011080	that there is only one path
5011080	5013080	that I look at.
5013080	5015080	This is a real amount,
5015080	5017080	and they are
5017080	5019080	at a certain point
5019080	5021080	equivalent,
5021080	5023080	if I take into account that
5023080	5025080	one needs more memory
5025080	5027080	and calculation time than the other.
5027080	5029080	But there are practical differences.
5029080	5031080	For example, I imagine
5031080	5033080	that our brain
5033080	5035080	is not a Turing machine,
5035080	5037080	but the individual neuron
5037080	5039080	does not go through
5039080	5041080	100% determinism in the next state
5041080	5043080	when its environment is in this and that state,
5043080	5045080	but it goes through a certain
5045080	5047080	probability in that state.
5047080	5049080	This means that if I have
5049080	5051080	a population of neurons next to each other
5051080	5053080	that have about the same environment
5053080	5055080	and have a certain amount of coincidence,
5055080	5057080	then they behave
5057080	5059080	similarly to a non-deterministic Turing machine.
5059080	5061080	That is, they are not so constrained
5061080	5063080	that they only go down one path,
5063080	5065080	but they sample a whole state space.
5065080	5067080	They not only do one function,
5067080	5069080	but they calculate several variants
5069080	5071080	of this function at the same time.
5071080	5073080	The substrate, of course,
5073080	5075080	has a limited resolution,
5075080	5077080	that is, the paths interact with each other
5077080	5079080	and this leads to the fact that
5079080	5081080	these states can collapse,
5081080	5083080	the neurons can finally vote
5083080	5085080	on the result.
5085080	5087080	But the interesting thing is that our brain
5087080	5089080	and our reasoning processes,
5089080	5091080	which our mind runs through,
5091080	5093080	have to be described in such a way that we do not
5093080	5095080	go through a sequence of states step by step,
5095080	5097080	but that we at the same time go through
5097080	5099080	a space of possible states in parallel.
5099080	5101080	And this space then votes with each other
5101080	5103080	and collapses again.
5103080	5105080	And if we try to go backwards through our thoughts,
5105080	5107080	we do not know in what states we have been,
5107080	5109080	because all these paths
5109080	5111080	have no traces left.
5111080	5113080	Nobody has noticed in what states we have all been.
5113080	5115080	And we can reconstruct a path,
5115080	5117080	that is, if we model our brain
5117080	5119080	as a stochastic,
5119080	5121080	non-deterministic Turing machine
5121080	5123080	with a limited substrate resolution,
5123080	5125080	we have a slightly different paradigm
5125080	5127080	than a deterministic Turing machine
5127080	5129080	that is calculated on a von Neumann computer.
5129080	5131080	Even if it would still be implementable on it?
5131080	5133080	Yes, it is still implementable on it, exactly.
5133080	5135080	This leads to confusion
5135080	5137080	in some philosophers,
5137080	5139080	for example the integrated information theory,
5139080	5141080	which is the consciousness theory
5141080	5143080	of Tononi and his students.
5143080	5145080	Philosophers believe in something like this.
5145080	5147080	Tononi says that
5147080	5149080	he can imagine
5149080	5151080	that you can build a neuromorphic computer,
5151080	5153080	one that behaves similarly,
5153080	5155080	even if it is built artificially,
5155080	5157080	like the distributed processes
5157080	5159080	of the information calculation of our brain,
5159080	5161080	that it can be conscious.
5161080	5163080	That it says, I feel, so I have consciousness.
5163080	5165080	But a von Neumann computer,
5165080	5167080	the one we have implemented
5167080	5169080	as a digital computer,
5169080	5171080	which works sequentially, does not.
5171080	5173080	And this leads to a problem,
5173080	5175080	namely that
5175080	5177080	we can,
5177080	5179080	through the Turing thesis,
5179080	5181080	which Tononi does not agree on,
5181080	5183080	prove that we can
5183080	5185080	emulate the neuromorphic computer
5185080	5187080	on the sequential computer.
5187080	5189080	That means we can build a computer
5189080	5191080	on the von Neumann computer
5191080	5193080	that behaves exactly like the neuromorphic computer.
5193080	5195080	They are completely equivalent.
5195080	5197080	And that means that it also says,
5197080	5199080	I feel, so I am.
5199080	5201080	In any case, it is a lie,
5201080	5203080	because it cannot feel anything
5203080	5205080	in the way it is conscious.
5205080	5207080	And that leads to the problem
5207080	5209080	that consciousness would be an epiphenomenon.
5209080	5211080	That is, that our statements,
5211080	5213080	that we are conscious,
5213080	5215080	are not caused by consciousness itself,
5215080	5217080	but we move our mouth mechanically by chance
5217080	5219080	as if it were caused by consciousness,
5219080	5221080	but it is not.
5221080	5223080	Consciousness, so to speak,
5223080	5225080	quietly on the side and observes
5225080	5227080	our physical realities in our mind,
5227080	5229080	which some people say, I have no consciousness,
5229080	5231080	others say, I have a consciousness,
5231080	5233080	and it cannot influence it somehow.
5233080	5235080	And epiphenomenonism is therefore
5235080	5237080	not a good theory,
5237080	5239080	because epiphenomenonists are not epiphenomenonists,
5239080	5241080	so they say, my consciousness
5241080	5243080	will not be physically effective,
5243080	5245080	because they have consciousness.
5245080	5247080	Consciousness does not cause epiphenomenonism.
5247080	5249080	The mouth movements of epiphenomenonist
5249080	5251080	philosophers are not caused by his consciousness.
5251080	5253080	And that is a very stupid theory,
5253080	5255080	which is why Tononi would not sign.
5255080	5257080	And that means, however,
5257080	5259080	that the integrated information theory,
5259080	5261080	if you have it in such a form,
5261080	5263080	as Tononi has it,
5263080	5265080	leads to a completely insolvent contradiction.
5265080	5267080	If you dissolve it, then only
5267080	5269080	global workspace theory remains.
5269080	5271080	But this is not a real theory,
5271080	5273080	but a framework, actually.
5273080	5275080	It is more of a framework.
5275080	5277080	But it does not explain functionally
5277080	5279080	how it comes to such states.
5279080	5281080	But that's what it means for me as a computer scientist,
5281080	5283080	I look at it with a certain indifference
5283080	5285080	and do not quite understand how you can do that.
5285080	5287080	For me, this is more of a control group,
5287080	5289080	a theory that has such an obvious logical contradiction
5289080	5291080	that a computer scientist in elementary school
5291080	5293080	recognizes that. How can you represent that?
5295080	5297080	So we have existence and non-existence at the same time.
5297080	5299080	And we are now in the second phase of existence.
5303080	5305080	And the simplest form of this
5305080	5307080	existing phase is
5307080	5309080	that we apply all operators
5309080	5311080	in parallel.
5311080	5313080	And this means that the universe simply
5313080	5315080	branches, in every step,
5315080	5317080	maximum branching,
5317080	5319080	because there is no selection function
5319080	5321080	for the operators. That means
5321080	5323080	that all operators are simply applied.
5323080	5325080	And an operator is a function
5325080	5327080	that takes a pattern from noticeable differences
5327080	5329080	and converts it into another
5329080	5331080	pattern from noticeable differences.
5331080	5333080	And all operators are simply
5333080	5335080	applied, and some of these operators
5335080	5337080	are very often applied, because they are
5337080	5339080	simple and often, and others are very rare.
5339080	5341080	And this leads to an interesting concept
5341080	5343080	of identity, because
5343080	5345080	there is no one.
5345080	5347080	What exists now is, for example, that
5347080	5349080	the photon would be, in this way,
5349080	5351080	an operator,
5351080	5353080	which always takes place
5353080	5355080	when there is an environment on which this operator
5355080	5357080	fits. So if, so to speak,
5357080	5359080	there is a photon-shaped hole in the universe,
5359080	5361080	then this photon operator is used
5361080	5363080	and shifts the environment
5363080	5365080	so that
5365080	5367080	the same hole is created,
5367080	5369080	plus a little bit further away.
5369080	5371080	And this way this photon operator
5371080	5373080	fits again in the next step.
5373080	5375080	That is, this is a sequence of
5375080	5377080	related operators
5377080	5379080	that can be applied one by one,
5379080	5381080	which leads to the fact that a pattern
5381080	5383080	continues in the space,
5383080	5385080	just like the glider in Game of Life.
5385080	5387080	With the difference that the space is not
5387080	5389080	given at all, regardless of the patterns,
5389080	5391080	but the space first arises by
5391080	5393080	the fact that I collect certain noticeable
5393080	5395080	differences in such a way that a
5395080	5397080	pattern is created that can be described as a space.
5397080	5399080	That is, the photon is an operator
5399080	5401080	or a sequence of operator
5401080	5403080	applications that lead to
5403080	5405080	that first a regularity is created
5405080	5407080	in which information can
5407080	5409080	spread and interact with
5409080	5411080	other information.
5411080	5413080	And that just results
5413080	5415080	by the fact that these operators
5415080	5417080	are possible.
5417080	5419080	And again to translate,
5419080	5421080	the base level reality,
5421080	5423080	that is, the lowest level of reality,
5423080	5425080	has nothing that goes ahead of it.
5425080	5427080	That is practically the definition of base level reality.
5427080	5429080	Every other reality that goes ahead
5429080	5431080	is practically a kind of simulation reality
5431080	5433080	where in the
5433080	5435080	parents' universe a computer
5435080	5437080	stands in some form
5437080	5439080	on which this underlying reality
5439080	5441080	runs. And the physicalism
5441080	5443080	is the idea that in our world
5443080	5445080	there is a mechanical amount of rules,
5445080	5447080	so not some refined
5447080	5449080	computer program in which
5449080	5451080	a programmer can intervene at any time,
5451080	5453080	but simply
5453080	5455080	a causally closed
5455080	5457080	amount of simple rules
5457080	5459080	from which everything emerges.
5459080	5461080	And that we are already in this base reality.
5461080	5463080	And the idea that is here
5463080	5465080	is that this base level
5465080	5467080	reality, because it has no priors,
5467080	5469080	nothing that goes ahead of it,
5469080	5471080	can be described
5471080	5473080	as simply everything that is possible
5473080	5475080	exists in it. And that
5475080	5477080	we exist in the space of all these
5477080	5479080	possibilities.
5479080	5481080	And the universe is a
5481080	5483080	tautology, so mathematically
5483080	5485080	tautology is something that exists
5485080	5487080	without conditions, for example A is equal to A
5487080	5489080	exists through the axiom of identity
5489080	5491080	in classical logic.
5491080	5493080	And that means that nothing new is said,
5493080	5495080	but it just results
5495080	5497080	from the assumption of these rules
5497080	5499080	as if there are no conditions.
5499080	5501080	Tautology are all these conditions
5501080	5503080	where nothing new is said.
5505080	5507080	And it can be described
5507080	5509080	as a non-deterministic
5509080	5511080	Turing machine,
5511080	5513080	so this machine that branches,
5513080	5515080	in this case in all branches,
5515080	5517080	and with all
5517080	5519080	Kolmogorov complexity of zero.
5519080	5521080	And Kolmogorov complexity
5521080	5523080	describes how complicated the algorithm
5523080	5525080	is.
5525080	5527080	Kolmogorov had the idea
5527080	5529080	that you can describe for different computer programs
5529080	5531080	or for different
5531080	5533080	functions how complicated they are.
5533080	5535080	By this, how long
5535080	5537080	is the program that you need
5537080	5539080	to define this function?
5541080	5543080	If you, like
5543080	5545080	Stephen Wolfram, try to find a function
5545080	5547080	from which our universe emerges,
5547080	5549080	then this function has
5549080	5551080	no length of zero, but it is an
5551080	5553080	automatic machine that needs a certain
5553080	5555080	number of steps to write it down
5555080	5557080	and a certain number of bits
5557080	5559080	to write it down.
5559080	5561080	And that would be the number of bits
5561080	5563080	that you need to write down an algorithm,
5563080	5565080	that would be the Kolmogorov complexity.
5565080	5567080	There is a problem
5567080	5569080	with Kolmogorov complexity.
5569080	5571080	When I write down the different computer languages,
5571080	5573080	they are different in length, depending on the language.
5573080	5575080	In practice, the problem is not that big,
5575080	5577080	because I can often
5577080	5579080	translate into these languages,
5579080	5581080	and this translation program is not very long,
5581080	5583080	so that I have a pretty good idea of what
5583080	5585080	the shortest is.
5585080	5587080	There are limits
5587080	5589080	where it is difficult, but in practice
5589080	5591080	the problem is not that big.
5591080	5593080	The Solomonov induction has similar problems.
5593080	5595080	Exactly.
5595080	5597080	The Solomonov induction basically describes
5597080	5599080	what a modeling system does.
5599080	5601080	For example, our mind,
5601080	5603080	Ray Solomonov had the idea
5603080	5605080	to systematize it
5605080	5607080	through a kind of Kolmogorov complexity.
5607080	5609080	He says that
5609080	5611080	what a mind does at the end of the day is that
5611080	5613080	it tries to predict the present
5613080	5615080	from the previous observations
5615080	5617080	through the shortest possible program,
5617080	5619080	that is, with the shortest possible Kolmogorov complexity.
5619080	5621080	For all pairs of current and
5621080	5623080	previous observations.
5625080	5627080	What I just said informally
5627080	5629080	is very nice to write down formally.
5629080	5631080	With this, you have a specification
5631080	5633080	for a universal modeling system,
5633080	5635080	which has the disadvantage
5635080	5637080	that it is so general
5637080	5639080	that you can't calculate it yet.
5639080	5641080	That means you have to find something
5641080	5643080	in practice that somehow
5643080	5645080	brings the Solomonov induction closer.
5645080	5647080	But back to the Kolmogorov complexity,
5647080	5649080	if we are in the base-level reality,
5649080	5651080	then there is no program
5651080	5653080	that is below this base-level reality.
5653080	5655080	That means it has to be in tautology.
5655080	5657080	That means the Kolmogorov complexity
5657080	5659080	of our universe should be zero.
5659080	5661080	That means a program of length zero.
5661080	5663080	And the easiest program of length zero,
5663080	5665080	if you do not assume
5665080	5667080	that length zero is nothing,
5667080	5669080	but all possibilities,
5669080	5671080	is simply applied to all operators.
5671080	5673080	And that means every operator is applied
5673080	5675080	wherever it fits.
5675080	5677080	There is always an operator
5677080	5679080	that fits in our world relatively often,
5679080	5681080	because there are many photon-shaped holes,
5681080	5683080	because the photon is relatively simple.
5683080	5685080	But you and I, we are operators
5685080	5687080	that are very rare, that are very rarely used,
5687080	5689080	because we need a relatively complex
5689080	5691080	environment to exist.
5691080	5693080	And that means we only appear
5693080	5695080	very, very rarely in our universe.
5695080	5697080	And then there are
5697080	5699080	some operators
5699080	5701080	that can only appear once,
5701080	5703080	namely on the one hand the Highlander.
5703080	5705080	You can only enter one of them,
5705080	5707080	it is defined like this.
5707080	5709080	And then the universe itself,
5709080	5711080	the entirety of all possibilities that exist.
5711080	5713080	And Stephen Wolfram calls it the Rolyard.
5713080	5715080	That is the thing that occurs
5715080	5717080	because you apply all operators
5717080	5719080	unlimitedly to each other.
5719080	5721080	Can you repeat the name
5721080	5723080	in English?
5723080	5725080	The entangled limit of everything.
5725080	5727080	The entangled limit of all possible computations.
5729080	5731080	But say it in English.
5731080	5733080	The entangled limit of all possible computations.
5733080	5735080	I don't like it that much,
5735080	5737080	because there are so many terms in there
5737080	5739080	that you have to explain first.
5739080	5741080	For example, what does entangled mean at the point?
5741080	5743080	And what is meant by that?
5743080	5745080	That they all hang together on one big thing.
5745080	5747080	That there is a path
5747080	5749080	in every direction, in every direction.
5749080	5751080	And limit means in the case that
5751080	5753080	it is actually unlimited.
5753080	5755080	In some places it is not unlimited.
5755080	5757080	Locally it is often the case
5757080	5759080	that when I have this Turing machine
5759080	5761080	and I have a branch,
5761080	5763080	then I don't always get
5763080	5765080	unlimited different states,
5765080	5767080	but sometimes the pattern is created by itself.
5767080	5769080	That means the branches meet
5769080	5771080	in a certain way by
5771080	5773080	creating the same patterns
5773080	5775080	on different paths.
5775080	5777080	That does not mean that they physically meet
5777080	5779080	and collide again,
5779080	5781080	but that when I try to write down
5781080	5783080	this calculation or to model from the outside,
5783080	5785080	that I often don't have so many different states
5785080	5787080	in which it goes,
5787080	5789080	and that means, for example,
5789080	5791080	that when I describe the particle,
5791080	5793080	then it is so that the individual particle
5793080	5795080	is often defined in such a way
5795080	5797080	that there is not only a possibility
5797080	5799080	in which it can exist, but there are many paths
5799080	5801080	that it can take, but many paths
5801080	5803080	then meet again. And where they meet,
5803080	5805080	there is again a convergence.
5805080	5807080	And this convergence leads to
5807080	5809080	that a part of the universe can predict
5809080	5811080	what another part of the universe will do.
5811080	5813080	And that is the prerequisite
5813080	5815080	for the creation of structure.
5815080	5817080	The structure of the universe is created
5817080	5819080	by the fact that there is control.
5819080	5821080	That is, a part of the universe can predict
5821080	5823080	what another part of the universe can do
5823080	5825080	and this part of the universe
5825080	5827080	can adjust to the other
5827080	5829080	and thus produce the local,
5829080	5831080	more stable structures.
5831080	5833080	And in a place where this does not happen,
5833080	5835080	there is no interaction and therefore no control.
5835080	5837080	And that means that there is then
5837080	5839080	no interesting structure,
5839080	5841080	but these are just random fluctuations.
5841080	5843080	And what you would expect
5843080	5845080	is that you find a lowest level
5845080	5847080	in which there are very, very many
5847080	5849080	random fluctuations,
5849080	5851080	which lead to nothing,
5851080	5853080	which are therefore not predictable
5853080	5855080	and are created by the fact that you do not know
5855080	5857080	in which path you end.
5857080	5859080	All paths are going at the same time,
5859080	5861080	you are always on a certain path of them
5861080	5863080	and in your path,
5863080	5865080	which splits up all the time,
5865080	5867080	that is, every bit in your universe
5867080	5869080	changes in a random way all the time,
5869080	5871080	there are these whole splinters
5871080	5873080	and most of these splinters
5873080	5875080	do nothing and sometimes
5875080	5877080	they swing up to a structure
5877080	5879080	and this structure gets bigger and bigger
5879080	5881080	depending on how strong
5881080	5883080	it leads to control processes.
5883080	5885080	And on the simplest level,
5885080	5887080	the control processes that occur
5887080	5889080	are particles that lead
5889080	5891080	to something like a space
5891080	5893080	being created in which
5893080	5895080	the particles can be assigned a momentum.
5895080	5897080	The momentum is the direction
5897080	5899080	from which the particles come
5899080	5901080	and the space is addressable,
5901080	5903080	that is, you can adjust to it,
5903080	5905080	what comes from this direction?
5905080	5907080	And these structures lead to
5907080	5909080	that these particles,
5909080	5911080	something like elemental particles,
5911080	5913080	form, that is, swirls that arise from these particles
5913080	5915080	that become stable and these swirls
5915080	5917080	can then, I can try mathematically
5917080	5919080	to guide which swirls are technically possible
5919080	5921080	because I apply such functions
5921080	5923080	to each other and at some point
5923080	5925080	such swirls arise from swirls
5925080	5927080	and these are the atoms
5927080	5929080	and there is a whole zoo
5929080	5931080	of such atoms that are stable
5931080	5933080	under these conditions.
5933080	5935080	And this zoo of atoms,
5935080	5937080	the physics has not yet figured out
5937080	5939080	how they can all guide them.
5939080	5941080	But the suspicion is that
5941080	5943080	there is a possibility, ultimately from the theory of numbers,
5943080	5945080	to guide the periodic table of elements
5945080	5947080	and to think about which things
5947080	5949080	are stable under which conditions
5949080	5951080	for how long and in which spaces,
5951080	5953080	how high-dimensional they are.
5953080	5955080	And what stands out, for example, is
5955080	5957080	that most things are only stable
5957080	5959080	in the three-dimensional space.
5959080	5961080	That is, the electromagnetism,
5961080	5963080	the forces with which
5963080	5965080	the atoms interact,
5965080	5967080	are ultimately all in this three-dimensional space.
5967080	5969080	So the photons and neutrinos
5969080	5971080	and so on are generations
5971080	5973080	of the same particle classes.
5973080	5975080	They all find themselves in
5975080	5977080	such a confined three-dimensional space
5977080	5979080	in which we are.
5979080	5981080	And the strong force and the weak force
5981080	5983080	are only within the atomic nucleus
5983080	5985080	and do not affect each other
5985080	5987080	over such a long distance.
5987080	5989080	Possibly this is due to the fact that
5989080	5991080	they form whirlpools in higher spaces
5991080	5993080	than in three-dimensional spaces.
5993080	5995080	And mathematically you can show that
5995080	5997080	rotation, so to speak,
5997080	5999080	is possible in two dimensions,
5999080	6001080	and in four dimensions,
6001080	6003080	and in eight dimensions.
6003080	6005080	But not more in sixteen dimensions.
6005080	6007080	They get a little more complicated every time.
6007080	6009080	And if you think about
6009080	6011080	what a whirlpool formation actually is,
6011080	6013080	for example, imagine
6013080	6015080	that you are in a bathtub
6015080	6017080	and you move your hand and observe
6017080	6019080	the whirlpools that form
6019080	6021080	on the surface of the bathtub,
6021080	6023080	most of these waves
6023080	6025080	disappear after a short time
6025080	6027080	in the background.
6027080	6029080	And the ones that are stable, so to speak,
6029080	6031080	are round whirlpools that remain
6031080	6033080	and that, like particles,
6033080	6035080	pull along the surface of the bathtub
6035080	6037080	as long as they either
6037080	6039080	go into other whirlpools
6039080	6041080	or disappear by friction,
6041080	6043080	or by interacting
6043080	6045080	with other things,
6045080	6047080	for example your hand
6047080	6049080	or something like that.
6049080	6051080	But for themselves they are stable.
6051080	6053080	This is due to the fact that
6053080	6055080	they rotate exactly into themselves.
6055080	6057080	That is, that they have an exact angle
6057080	6059080	in their momentum,
6059080	6061080	that the information remains constant
6061080	6063080	in the volume and does not disappear
6063080	6065080	from this volume, that is,
6065080	6067080	flows out into the room.
6067080	6069080	For example, if I look at rotation
6069080	6071080	in some discrete vector spaces
6071080	6073080	or something like that,
6073080	6075080	is that the mathematical formalization
6075080	6077080	of these whirlpools?
6077080	6079080	Yes, so if you think about it,
6079080	6081080	what is a rotation?
6081080	6083080	It is an operation for 2D,
6083080	6085080	a vector operation in a
6085080	6087080	two-dimensional space.
6087080	6089080	If we think about it,
6089080	6091080	what do dimensions actually mean?
6091080	6093080	We get the first dimension
6093080	6095080	by taking our whole numbers
6095080	6097080	in the whirlpooling scheme
6097080	6099080	as a kind of number stream.
6099080	6101080	We had found that
6101080	6103080	processes and sequences are sufficient
6103080	6105080	to move around on a number stream
6105080	6107080	when it is ordered.
6107080	6109080	And then we can use additions
6109080	6111080	to teleport and zoom with multiplication.
6111080	6113080	And the same thing works
6113080	6115080	with two-dimensional numbers.
6115080	6117080	Two-dimensional numbers are created
6117080	6119080	by taking our number stream
6119080	6121080	and folding it, for example.
6121080	6123080	In the computer you can create
6123080	6125080	the one-dimensional address space
6125080	6127080	where every memory cell
6127080	6129080	in the computer gets an address.
6129080	6131080	From which I can determine the process
6131080	6133080	like on a Turing machine
6133080	6135080	where one cell moves forward and backward.
6135080	6137080	You can also simply say,
6137080	6139080	I'm going 100 steps forward
6139080	6141080	and I get to the next cell of my array.
6141080	6143080	And this simple operation,
6143080	6145080	right and left, I do plus or minus 1
6145080	6147080	and up and down I do plus or minus 100.
6147080	6149080	This way I have a possibility
6149080	6151080	to fold my number stream in the computer
6151080	6153080	into a lattice.
6153080	6155080	And this lattice
6155080	6157080	is a simple way to make it two-dimensional.
6157080	6159080	There are many possibilities.
6159080	6161080	I can do this as a spiral,
6161080	6163080	then I have something like polar coordinates.
6163080	6165080	Or as a Hilbert curve
6165080	6167080	that fills space.
6167080	6169080	And there are many tricks
6169080	6171080	with which you can fill the space
6171080	6173080	in such a way that you always get
6173080	6175080	smaller 8-core points
6175080	6177080	and get such an unboundedness.
6177080	6179080	And in this two-dimensional number space
6179080	6181080	that I can calculate all together,
6181080	6183080	these two-dimensional lattice,
6183080	6185080	I can define a rotation
6185080	6187080	as an additional operation.
6187080	6189080	So first of all I can do two-dimensional addition.
6189080	6191080	That means I teleport
6191080	6193080	into two dimensions.
6193080	6195080	I can also zoom into two dimensions
6195080	6197080	by multiplying my vector,
6197080	6199080	my coordinate pair
6199080	6201080	with a one-dimensional number.
6201080	6203080	I zoom in and out.
6203080	6205080	But I can also rotate
6205080	6207080	by using the second coordinate
6207080	6209080	by multiplying with the complex number.
6211080	6213080	Rotating leads to
6213080	6215080	that I can build a structure
6215080	6217080	that remains constant
6217080	6219080	even though I move it
6219080	6221080	away from the dimension.
6221080	6223080	In the simplest case I rotate
6223080	6225080	it by 90 degrees.
6225080	6227080	And I can also rotate it
6227080	6229080	in parts of 90 degrees
6229080	6231080	if I manage to define a function
6231080	6233080	with which I can make the intervals smaller.
6233080	6235080	And the function
6235080	6237080	with which I can keep a structure constant
6237080	6239080	even though I make the intervals smaller
6239080	6241080	is a rotation.
6241080	6243080	A kind of continuous permutation.
6245080	6247080	And if I want to keep a dynamic structure
6247080	6249080	constant,
6249080	6251080	so that the information does not dissipate
6251080	6253080	under information maintenance conditions,
6253080	6255080	then it has to be a kind of rotation.
6255080	6257080	Something where the information
6257080	6259080	rotates back in itself.
6259080	6261080	And such rotations,
6261080	6263080	the easiest ones, are a multiplication
6263080	6265080	with a complex number, with a two-dimensional number.
6265080	6267080	And the thing is that
6267080	6269080	in two dimensions
6269080	6271080	this works, but in three dimensions
6271080	6273080	I can only
6273080	6275080	perform two-dimensional rotations,
6275080	6277080	not three-dimensional.
6277080	6279080	If you think about it, if we rotate something in 3D,
6279080	6281080	then it's always about an axis in a plane.
6283080	6285080	This is because in 3D
6285080	6287080	there are no complex numbers,
6287080	6289080	like an i,
6289080	6291080	in complex numbers there are no
6291080	6293080	i and j,
6293080	6295080	which have this property
6295080	6297080	that you can define multiplications
6297080	6299080	that lead to a constant
6299080	6301080	of the pattern.
6301080	6303080	This means that all three-dimensional rotations
6303080	6305080	are two-dimensional.
6305080	6307080	We only use a subset
6307080	6309080	of the three dimensions.
6309080	6311080	There is always a certain exception to this.
6311080	6313080	For example smoke rings.
6313080	6315080	A smoke ring is a torus
6315080	6317080	that rotates around a circle.
6317080	6319080	And this works
6319080	6321080	because you can compress the air.
6321080	6323080	In order for the torus to rotate,
6323080	6325080	you have to compress the air
6325080	6327080	on the inside of the smoke ring
6327080	6329080	while it turns inside and
6329080	6331080	extends outwards.
6331080	6333080	This works because the air is elastic.
6333080	6335080	That's why you can blow
6335080	6337080	air rings underwater.
6337080	6339080	Many people do it for fun,
6339080	6341080	because the air is compressible.
6341080	6343080	But you can't blow water rings underwater,
6343080	6345080	because the water is not compressible.
6345080	6347080	The compressibility of the air
6347080	6349080	means that the space is crumpled.
6349080	6351080	It is weakly four-dimensional.
6353080	6355080	This smoke ring is a rotation
6355080	6357080	that is only possible in three-dimensional space,
6357080	6359080	because the three-dimensional space
6359080	6361080	has a little more than three dimensions
6361080	6363080	if you can compress it.
6363080	6365080	In four dimensions,
6365080	6367080	I can define new rotations.
6367080	6369080	For example, I can take a ball
6369080	6371080	and rotate it around itself
6371080	6373080	so that the inside turns outwards.
6373080	6375080	This is not possible in three-dimensional space,
6375080	6377080	because the surface will overlap with itself.
6377080	6379080	But in four-dimensional space,
6379080	6381080	I have an additional dimension.
6381080	6383080	That means I have a rotation
6383080	6385080	where I rotate 360 degrees,
6385080	6387080	but it is not as precise as before.
6387080	6389080	I tried to rotate a circle,
6389080	6391080	but I have to rotate 360 degrees
6391080	6393080	another time
6393080	6395080	so that I get back to my starting point.
6395080	6397080	So I rotate 720 degrees
6397080	6399080	so that I get around it.
6399080	6401080	Interestingly,
6401080	6403080	in music there are rotations
6403080	6405080	where you have to rotate 360 degrees
6405080	6407080	so that you get back to your starting point.
6407080	6409080	These are spinors.
6409080	6411080	It is really cool
6411080	6413080	that you can get into mathematics
6413080	6415080	and derive from the theory of numbers
6415080	6417080	what rotations are possible.
6417080	6419080	The cool thing is that these spinor spaces
6419080	6421080	are the algebras in which rotations are possible.
6421080	6423080	That is the Fredkin thing, isn't it?
6423080	6425080	I don't think Fredkin discovered it.
6425080	6427080	I don't know who discovered it first.
6427080	6429080	I can't give a reference,
6429080	6431080	but a friend of mine
6431080	6433080	gave me a series of texts.
6433080	6435080	Unfortunately, I lost the source.
6435080	6437080	You have to ask who it was.
6437080	6439080	It is that you can derive
6439080	6441080	the rotations from the theory of numbers
6441080	6443080	and create the reference to quantum mechanics.
6443080	6445080	What I find interesting
6445080	6447080	philosophically and genealogically
6447080	6449080	is that with methods
6449080	6451080	of natural sciences
6451080	6453080	or computer science
6453080	6455080	in the end,
6455080	6457080	you define it as a new
6457080	6459080	rationalist program of philosophy.
6459080	6461080	Of course.
6461080	6463080	And I find that funny
6463080	6465080	that rationalism
6465080	6467080	finds the way back
6467080	6469080	into philosophy
6469080	6471080	via stem or something like that.
6471080	6473080	That is a nice way back.
6473080	6475080	I would express it a little differently.
6475080	6477080	In my opinion,
6477080	6479080	we have a number of
6479080	6481080	philosophical fundamental questions.
6481080	6483080	The famous four questions of philosophy.
6483080	6485080	What is going on?
6485080	6487080	Why does this happen to me?
6489080	6491080	What should I do?
6491080	6493080	That is the ethics.
6493080	6495080	And what can I know?
6495080	6497080	Epistemology,
6497080	6499080	ontology,
6499080	6501080	ethics and metaphysics.
6501080	6503080	These questions can be put
6503080	6505080	by computationalism
6505080	6507080	on a common basis.
6507080	6509080	Computationalism is nothing
6509080	6511080	other than the amount of all formal languages.
6511080	6513080	And the subset is implementable.
6515080	6517080	And after we have seen
6517080	6519080	that some of the formal languages
6519080	6521080	are not implementable,
6521080	6523080	there are specifications
6523080	6525080	such as the hairdresser
6525080	6527080	who cuts the beard of all men
6527080	6529080	who shave themselves,
6529080	6531080	which leads to contradictions.
6531080	6533080	We only cut out the languages
6533080	6535080	that are implementable.
6535080	6537080	And these are the computational languages.
6537080	6539080	And after I realized that all these
6539080	6541080	languages are also equally powerful,
6541080	6543080	that I can represent each one
6543080	6545080	through each other,
6545080	6547080	if they are so powerful that I can build a computer with them,
6547080	6549080	I have a system with which I can describe reality.
6549080	6551080	Every possible language in which
6551080	6553080	something can be represented,
6553080	6555080	but also every language in which
6555080	6557080	structural education is possible.
6557080	6559080	And that allows me
6559080	6561080	to unite
6561080	6563080	the philosophy into a system.
6563080	6565080	And of course I am not the first
6565080	6567080	who has done this.
6567080	6569080	But the interesting thing is that
6569080	6571080	the longer I do this,
6571080	6573080	the later the parties get.
6573080	6575080	And what is fascinating for me
6575080	6577080	is that I did not find out
6577080	6579080	anything about it in my own studies.
6579080	6581080	And I was very depressed
6581080	6583080	that these things, these building blocks,
6583080	6585080	were not put together in a way that was not recognizable to me.
6585080	6587080	And I do not have the claim
6587080	6589080	to say that this is a good alternative
6589080	6591080	to what my philosophy teachers have done
6591080	6593080	in my studies,
6593080	6595080	but in the end I am just a guy
6595080	6597080	who has existential questions
6597080	6599080	and who has the same questions from other people
6599080	6601080	as I do.
6601080	6603080	And to form a system in which I can understand
6603080	6605080	how thinking works
6605080	6607080	and who we are, and how consciousness
6607080	6609080	and language and representation
6609080	6611080	can work, but also how existence
6611080	6613080	can work. And all of this
6613080	6615080	all fits together.
6617080	6619080	In addition to the
6619080	6621080	split
6621080	6623080	by the non-deterministic Turing machine,
6623080	6625080	on the one hand,
6625080	6627080	because a lot of operators are used
6627080	6629080	in every condition,
6629080	6631080	we have a loss of information
6631080	6633080	all the time.
6633080	6635080	Because only the things that
6635080	6637080	are controllable, that are controllable
6637080	6639080	and stabilize, they stay.
6639080	6641080	And all other things are just
6641080	6643080	new to us
6643080	6645080	or they disappear completely.
6647080	6649080	Nevertheless, there are
6649080	6651080	these branches.
6651080	6653080	And that would mean that we accept
6653080	6655080	something like a multiversum theory,
6655080	6657080	unless we assume
6657080	6659080	that it is only certain branches
6659080	6661080	that are allowed to stabilize at all,
6661080	6663080	right?
6663080	6665080	That does not exclude both. The thing is
6665080	6667080	that it is often the case that several branches
6667080	6669080	are allowed to stabilize, but you still
6669080	6671080	do not know which one you are.
6671080	6673080	That means that you get a situation
6673080	6675080	that you have a double split experiment
6675080	6677080	and you do not know through which split
6677080	6679080	the photon goes, because it goes
6679080	6681080	through the whole split, but not
6681080	6683080	through your path. In your path
6683080	6685080	it only goes through one.
6685080	6687080	And you do not know which path it is.
6687080	6689080	As an observer who is embedded
6689080	6691080	and coexists with this photon,
6691080	6693080	you do not know if you are in the path
6693080	6695080	where the photon goes through the right or left split.
6695080	6697080	The only thing you can say is that
6697080	6699080	if you look at millions of photons,
6699080	6701080	then there will be the following statistical
6701080	6703080	pattern about the interactions.
6703080	6705080	And this statistical pattern
6705080	6707080	you can say in advance. And the photon
6707080	6709080	is also such a statistical pattern.
6709080	6711080	That means that this is also a regularity
6711080	6713080	that results in structures in the universe
6713080	6715080	beginning to be so predictable
6715080	6717080	for each other that they
6717080	6719080	can stabilize.
6719080	6721080	Okay, and how do I make sure
6721080	6723080	that I'm always on the right path?
6723080	6725080	Yes, I think
6725080	6727080	that's a totally nice greeting
6727080	6729080	that you can derive from it,
6729080	6731080	that you say, do you always
6731080	6733080	want to be in the best path
6733080	6735080	in the multiverse?
6735080	6737080	But the thing is that this multiverse
6737080	6739080	does not, so to speak,
6739080	6741080	arise from the fact that the physicists
6741080	6743080	have gone wild and
6743080	6745080	have connections in the world that
6745080	6747080	you can not check and that
6747080	6749080	you can never prove and then
6749080	6751080	postulate all these additional paths,
6751080	6753080	but that there is simply no possibility
6753080	6755080	to determine a priori
6755080	6757080	that there is only one path.
6757080	6759080	And that in the basic reality it is probably not
6759080	6761080	possible that there is only one path,
6761080	6763080	because there is simply nothing that
6763080	6765080	there is only one path.
6765080	6767080	I used this thing
6767080	6769080	where you use all operators on all operators
6769080	6771080	to discuss with students
6771080	6773080	who told me, yes, Wolfram
6773080	6775080	just wrote an article
6775080	6777080	about it, he has the same idea.
6777080	6779080	And then I read it and
6779080	6781080	realized, yes, that looks like the same idea.
6781080	6783080	I also tried to understand
6783080	6785080	myself with him.
6785080	6787080	In the time when I worked at
6787080	6789080	Interlabs, I held
6789080	6791080	a number of panel discussions with
6791080	6793080	people that I found interesting,
6793080	6795080	which I then invited to discuss
6795080	6797080	topics with us that interested us.
6797080	6799080	And Steven Wolfram kindly
6799080	6801080	agreed to it.
6801080	6803080	And I tried to ask him
6803080	6805080	questions about the boundaries of the role.
6805080	6807080	But unfortunately
6807080	6809080	he was not ready at the points
6809080	6811080	where we did not know the answers
6811080	6813080	to discuss further.
6813080	6815080	I think he had to figure it out for himself first.
6815080	6817080	If everything
6817080	6819080	that is possible is simply the case,
6819080	6821080	because if you do not have any
6821080	6823080	prior, no bid
6823080	6825080	to specify that
6825080	6827080	the possible is not there,
6827080	6829080	then people think very quickly, okay, then
6829080	6831080	everything I can imagine is going to happen somewhere.
6831080	6833080	And then we asked ourselves if it was the same as the cover.
6833080	6835080	Because everything that is possible means
6835080	6837080	that if you apply all operators
6837080	6839080	that all structures that arise from it
6839080	6841080	are the possible structures. But it can be very likely
6841080	6843080	that you can imagine something incomplete,
6843080	6845080	I don't know, if the unicorn
6845080	6847080	flies through or something,
6847080	6849080	which is still not realized.
6849080	6851080	And I think that would be the difference to this multiversum,
6851080	6853080	where then suddenly everything that is imaginable
6853080	6855080	has to exist, because there is everything,
6855080	6857080	versus, well, everything that
6857080	6859080	arises from the repeated application of one operator
6859080	6861080	on all rules is then there.
6861080	6863080	But do you know the difference?
6863080	6865080	Yes, of course, the thing is
6865080	6867080	the Boltzmann universe, so to speak,
6867080	6869080	the global state of the universe
6869080	6871080	goes into another global state
6871080	6873080	that is not correlated with the previous one.
6873080	6875080	Yes, it is possible,
6875080	6877080	but extremely unlikely,
6877080	6879080	because it is an extremely complex
6879080	6881080	operator, which is therefore
6881080	6883080	very rare. And that means
6883080	6885080	the probability that you are currently
6885080	6887080	in the Boltzmann state is extremely
6887080	6889080	low, because normally
6889080	6891080	structured structures in the
6891080	6893080	Boltzmann universe do not arise.
6893080	6895080	And that means that the
6895080	6897080	probability that you are practically in a sequential
6897080	6899080	or operator sequence
6899080	6901080	is much, much greater, because there are much more
6901080	6903080	possibilities, more paths on which
6903080	6905080	a universe that looks like ours
6905080	6907080	arises. That means you can't exactly
6907080	6909080	know where you are in this big fractal,
6909080	6911080	that you create by the rules, that you just
6911080	6913080	generate everything from one, all the time
6913080	6915080	with all possibilities.
6915080	6917080	It is the probability that you are
6917080	6919080	in the thing that is created
6919080	6921080	by the sequential operator application
6921080	6923080	of simple operators
6923080	6925080	is astronomically larger.
6925080	6927080	So the Boltzmann
6927080	6929080	brain requires a maximum complex
6929080	6931080	operator, in which you transfer the whole
6931080	6933080	universe in one step
6933080	6935080	into a state that is not correlated.
6937080	6939080	And again,
6939080	6941080	I want to break it down a bit
6941080	6943080	again, but on one example.
6943080	6945080	In the multiverse, one would think,
6945080	6947080	there is now also a universe
6947080	6949080	in which my hand is somehow
6949080	6951080	just above my head.
6951080	6953080	And in fact you don't know if
6953080	6955080	that is possible. You don't know if
6955080	6957080	through the repeated applications of one operator
6957080	6959080	somewhere
6959080	6961080	such a branch ends in the situation
6961080	6963080	that I raise my arm.
6963080	6965080	So I don't do it on purpose so that we
6965080	6967080	can continue to doubt whether it is possible.
6967080	6969080	But with the normal, what I meant,
6969080	6971080	multiversum theories, they would say
6971080	6973080	that everything is there,
6973080	6975080	what is possible. So do you know a little
6975080	6977080	what I mean? I know what you mean.
6977080	6979080	You just answered and maybe I didn't
6979080	6981080	really understand it, but...
6981080	6983080	Yes, the thing is that it is not clear
6983080	6985080	how we should prove
6985080	6987080	that we come to a universe through the simple
6987080	6989080	application of operators
6989080	6991080	that looks so macroscopically similar to us
6991080	6993080	and would be allowed,
6993080	6995080	but possibly does not work
6995080	6997080	microscopically. Exactly, okay.
6997080	6999080	So it could just be that many imaginable things
6999080	7001080	are not possible
7001080	7003080	in the real world. They are
7003080	7005080	still there. Even if we
7005080	7007080	think, yes, if we could
7007080	7009080	imagine it, of course the imagination is not complete
7009080	7011080	and it is not implemented in the imagination,
7011080	7013080	then it would still be possible. We had
7013080	7015080	questions yesterday. Did I
7015080	7017080	satisfy what you asked?
7017080	7019080	Yes.
7019080	7021080	Yes.
7021080	7023080	That is also a bit Wolfram's idea
7023080	7025080	that through the application of all operators
7025080	7027080	still something specific happens
7027080	7029080	and not somehow,
7029080	7031080	so everything happens, but that the roulette
7031080	7033080	still somehow has a structure or something.
7033080	7035080	Everything is possible, it is something specific
7035080	7037080	in the end. Yes.
7037080	7039080	Yes. Exactly, but it is something
7039080	7041080	not, so to speak, one percent homogeneous
7041080	7043080	or something like that, which always looks exactly
7043080	7045080	the same in every direction and so on.
7045080	7047080	You could somehow think that.
7047080	7049080	And that means,
7049080	7051080	but if we now express ourselves in this
7051080	7053080	classical language of philosophy,
7053080	7055080	then there is something
7055080	7057080	that we, well, then there is a difference
7057080	7059080	between what is possible
7059080	7061080	and what we can imagine.
7061080	7063080	You could say,
7063080	7065080	for example, that somehow God's face
7065080	7067080	appears in the clouds there or
7067080	7069080	the unicorn flies through here or something like that.
7069080	7071080	We can imagine that, but we can
7071080	7073080	perhaps not imagine
7073080	7075080	that with the complete
7075080	7077080	causality catch up to the beginning.
7077080	7079080	And that's why we don't know
7079080	7081080	whether it is actually a possibility,
7081080	7083080	even if it is a possible possibility.
7083080	7085080	Yes, that means
7085080	7087080	if we say imaginable,
7087080	7089080	then we have to make it clear that our
7089080	7091080	representations are very fluid.
7091080	7093080	We can imagine
7093080	7095080	that we are millionaires,
7095080	7097080	but the problem is to get the causal chain
7097080	7099080	that leads us to become millionaires
7099080	7101080	is very complex.
7101080	7103080	That means,
7103080	7105080	to trigger the control process
7105080	7107080	that leads to a representation
7107080	7109080	being justified,
7109080	7111080	is the problem.
7111080	7113080	And the control processes are ultimately
7113080	7115080	on the lowest level of causality
7115080	7117080	of the universe and then swing up.
7117080	7119080	And a control process means,
7119080	7121080	it's a term from the theory of regulation,
7121080	7123080	from the humanistic theory,
7123080	7125080	that you have a system that
7125080	7127080	stabilizes its own structure,
7127080	7129080	that can be described as if it were to do so.
7129080	7131080	And that means that as soon as
7131080	7133080	it runs out of certain parameters,
7133080	7135080	a counter-force appears that leads
7135080	7137080	to push it back into these parameters.
7137080	7139080	And in the case of the
7139080	7141080	whirl on the surface of the water,
7141080	7143080	it is as simple as possible.
7143080	7145080	Because with the whirl in the surface of the water,
7145080	7147080	you move your hand at the beginning
7147080	7149080	and all vectors arise in the water molecules.
7149080	7151080	And most of these lead
7151080	7153080	to the fact that the information
7153080	7155080	that is created by the whirl
7155080	7157080	is no longer recognizable.
7157080	7159080	After a short time, the waves scatter
7159080	7161080	and only a very small part of this information
7161080	7163080	leads to the stable whirl structure.
7163080	7165080	The rest
7165080	7167080	simply dissipates out.
7167080	7169080	It simply evaporates.
7169080	7171080	It evaporates into the background.
7171080	7173080	And only the part that, so to speak,
7173080	7175080	selects itself for it,
7175080	7177080	by having the exact right vector
7177080	7179080	to keep itself in this circle, stays there.
7179080	7181080	And at the next higher level,
7181080	7183080	these systems can interact with each other.
7183080	7185080	And they form stable systems
7185080	7187080	that you can squish a little.
7187080	7189080	And they come back
7189080	7191080	to their starting point.
7191080	7193080	This ideal whirl, as soon as you squish it,
7193080	7195080	it dissolves.
7195080	7197080	But in the whirl
7197080	7199080	that you see in the surface of the water,
7199080	7201080	it is already a bit more stable.
7201080	7203080	For example, the surface of the water has viscosity.
7203080	7205080	That means the molecules
7205080	7207080	target the surface of the water
7207080	7209080	in a certain way, so that it tries
7209080	7211080	to stay stable, but is also stretchable.
7211080	7213080	And that means that the thing already has a certain
7213080	7215080	robustness when you push against it
7215080	7217080	and cause disturbance,
7217080	7219080	so that it moves back to its original form
7219080	7221080	and is elastic.
7221080	7223080	Or imagine a soap bubble.
7223080	7225080	A soap bubble is such a thing
7225080	7227080	where you have a structure
7227080	7229080	in 3D
7229080	7231080	that balances several
7231080	7233080	criteria against each other,
7233080	7235080	namely the surface tension of the fluid
7235080	7237080	that forms the border of the soap bubble
7237080	7239080	and the pressure of the air inside.
7239080	7241080	And the two of them push against each other
7241080	7243080	so strongly that a stable structure
7243080	7245080	exists that can withstand many disturbances.
7245080	7247080	Or imagine
7247080	7249080	a water molecule
7249080	7251080	in which you have
7251080	7253080	two hydrogen atoms
7253080	7255080	and a oxygen atom.
7255080	7257080	And they are bound together
7257080	7259080	by the actinomatism
7259080	7261080	that arises in the atom shells
7261080	7263080	and leads to electron pairs.
7263080	7265080	You can squish the thing
7265080	7267080	to a certain extent
7267080	7269080	and it comes back to its original state.
7269080	7271080	And the things that are stable
7271080	7273080	over a wide range of squishings
7273080	7275080	are the periodic table of elements.
7275080	7277080	And those that are not, are things
7277080	7279080	that fall apart relatively quickly.
7279080	7281080	Or fall apart immediately.
7281080	7283080	And the rare elements are the ones
7283080	7285080	that fall apart very quickly
7285080	7287080	under the conditions in which they exist.
7287080	7289080	That is, they do not stay stable for long,
7289080	7291080	but fall apart when there are small disturbances.
7291080	7293080	But the interesting thing about them
7293080	7295080	is that the disturbances
7295080	7297080	are always regulated instantly.
7297080	7299080	So similar to the thermostat.
7299080	7301080	The thermostat is a controller
7301080	7303080	that only measures the current
7303080	7305080	and only regulates in the current.
7305080	7307080	And the really interesting control systems
7307080	7309080	are the ones that regulate the future.
7309080	7311080	So they are prepared
7311080	7313080	for a number of possible disturbances
7313080	7315080	in the future and are able
7315080	7317080	to intervene on future disturbances
7317080	7319080	in such a way that they now
7319080	7321080	lead the appropriate future.
7321080	7323080	We call them agents.
7323080	7325080	An agent is a controller
7325080	7327080	for future conditions.
7327080	7329080	And then it turns out that the easiest
7329080	7331080	agents that we can see in nature,
7331080	7333080	which at least I can see, are cells.
7333080	7335080	It is a kind of super molecule
7335080	7337080	that I can keep stable
7337080	7339080	over many, many types of environmental conditions
7339080	7341080	so that it can predict the future.
7341080	7343080	And the cell is a totally fascinating system.
7343080	7345080	It consists on the one hand
7345080	7347080	of a self-replicator
7347080	7349080	and on the other hand of a Turing machine.
7349080	7351080	The Turing machine has a typewriter,
7351080	7353080	the reprisome,
7353080	7355080	and the DNA.
7355080	7357080	And all of these are small tapes
7357080	7359080	that spin around additionally.
7359080	7361080	And then there is a neck entropy extractor,
7361080	7363080	a system that is able
7363080	7365080	to become stable against disturbances
7365080	7367080	by spilling these disturbances
7367080	7369080	out of the system.
7369080	7371080	And the structures on which
7371080	7373080	these disturbances are written,
7373080	7375080	such as molecules that move quickly
7375080	7377080	and are warm, are spilt out of the cell
7377080	7379080	that you collect,
7379080	7381080	do not have this information that disturbs you.
7381080	7383080	In order to be stable,
7383080	7385080	an agent has to be able to forget
7385080	7387080	the disturbances that are added to him.
7387080	7389080	Otherwise, the knowledge about these disturbances
7389080	7391080	accumulates in the information collection.
7393080	7395080	And in order to achieve this,
7395080	7397080	you have to, so to speak,
7397080	7399080	clean yourself all the time.
7399080	7401080	And if you do something clean,
7401080	7403080	something else becomes dirty.
7403080	7405080	And what becomes dirty, you have to push out of yourself.
7405080	7407080	We all live on Earth in a way
7407080	7409080	that it encodes disturbances
7409080	7411080	into particles,
7411080	7413080	mostly as speed differences
7413080	7415080	in particles.
7415080	7417080	And this statistic of speed differences
7417080	7419080	in particles is called heat.
7419080	7421080	And it is then radiated
7421080	7423080	into the deep space.
7423080	7425080	This is the sink for the whole entropy.
7425080	7427080	And we fill up these particles
7427080	7429080	by collecting fresh photons
7429080	7431080	that are nicely sorted from the sun.
7431080	7433080	And the sun is, so to speak,
7433080	7435080	a neck entropy of order
7435080	7437080	that we convert into disorder.
7437080	7439080	And we, as organisms,
7439080	7441080	exist as pumps
7441080	7443080	from order to disorder.
7443080	7445080	This allows us to maintain
7445080	7447080	our structure
7447080	7449080	and by building more and more structures,
7449080	7451080	building more and more complexity,
7451080	7453080	we are able to convert more and more
7453080	7455080	of this neck entropy
7455080	7457080	into disorder.
7459080	7461080	You just presented
7461080	7463080	a fascinating model
7463080	7465080	with which one can build
7465080	7467080	a foundation for the four core questions
7467080	7469080	of philosophy.
7469080	7471080	And you also said
7471080	7473080	that you are not the first
7473080	7475080	to do this.
7475080	7477080	But why have so few people
7477080	7479080	accepted this so far?
7479080	7481080	In physics, in philosophy,
7481080	7483080	also in mathematics.
7483080	7485080	Of course, I could say that many people
7485080	7487080	in computer science have accepted this.
7487080	7489080	You just talked about
7489080	7491080	Paul Bauer,
7491080	7493080	who has already tried
7493080	7495080	to lead this struggle
7495080	7497080	in the academy, so to speak.
7497080	7499080	And I think,
7499080	7501080	yes, exactly,
7501080	7503080	Wildberger does it too.
7503080	7505080	And I don't know, probably Ed Friedkin
7505080	7507080	did it. And there are some people
7507080	7509080	who have tried it.
7509080	7511080	And the best explanation
7511080	7513080	that I've heard so far
7513080	7515080	why they don't accept it
7515080	7517080	– well, I know a little bit
7517080	7519080	about mathematics – is because
7519080	7521080	the proofs are simply so inelegant.
7521080	7523080	That means,
7523080	7525080	if I now
7525080	7527080	do a constructive or
7527080	7529080	an intuitionist mathematics,
7529080	7531080	then I just need for some proofs
7531080	7533080	so much longer.
7533080	7535080	Before that, I could just say, yes,
7535080	7537080	assuming that it is not so
7537080	7539080	contradictory, done,
7539080	7541080	super fast,
7541080	7543080	not followed by P,
7543080	7545080	and that went
7545080	7547080	on for half a page. And if I
7547080	7549080	want to do this constructively,
7549080	7551080	then I might need ten pages
7551080	7553080	or so for it. That means, I think,
7553080	7555080	why mathematicians don't accept it
7555080	7557080	is because they first think,
7557080	7559080	yes, it works, what we do.
7559080	7561080	We don't have any problems. Why should we change anything?
7561080	7563080	That you can't
7563080	7565080	put it in a computer.
7565080	7567080	The pure mathematicians are not really interested in that.
7567080	7569080	And they find it somehow
7569080	7571080	inelegant. Do you think
7571080	7573080	that's an argument? Can you understand that?
7573080	7575080	Do you think,
7575080	7577080	while doing that,
7577080	7579080	do you have an idea
7579080	7581080	if there are people who try it?
7581080	7583080	I have recently read a little introduction
7583080	7585080	to constructive analysis.
7585080	7587080	I think it was from 1967 or so.
7587080	7589080	And then
7589080	7591080	the introduction was like, yes, and I'm sure
7591080	7593080	that in the end we will be kept right.
7593080	7595080	And not,
7595080	7597080	it won't take too long.
7597080	7599080	Now it's 50 years
7599080	7601080	or even longer, and nothing has
7601080	7603080	been done.
7603080	7605080	Do you see a way?
7605080	7607080	I have the impression that something is already happening.
7607080	7609080	Just like in philosophy
7609080	7611080	something is happening. It's just
7611080	7613080	that the rest doesn't go away.
7613080	7615080	And what very rarely
7615080	7617080	happens in science is that a group
7617080	7619080	of people who have built
7619080	7621080	a tradition for a long time
7621080	7623080	looks at themselves
7623080	7625080	and says, okay,
7625080	7627080	we're giving it up now, or we're done now.
7627080	7629080	But in the end
7629080	7631080	these currents are all self-contained
7631080	7633080	if there are enough time spaces
7633080	7635080	over time.
7635080	7637080	And the other problem is that so and so much
7637080	7639080	fits into the human mind over the lifetime.
7639080	7641080	I met
7641080	7643080	Sam Adams, a computer scientist,
7643080	7645080	an AI researcher.
7645080	7647080	I went to a conference.
7647080	7649080	He worked at IBM for many years
7649080	7651080	and said he had a very
7651080	7653080	vague feeling when he went to an AI
7653080	7655080	conference with me,
7655080	7657080	because he had the impression that he
7657080	7659080	had been out of the current
7659080	7661080	business for 20 years,
7661080	7663080	in the artificial intelligence
7663080	7665080	and that he was probably completely
7665080	7667080	detached. He had continued
7667080	7669080	building his own things all the time,
7669080	7671080	but maybe since Minsky and so on
7671080	7673080	what he read and thought back then
7673080	7675080	is already so much further
7675080	7677080	and the new generation
7677080	7679080	has gone far away from him.
7679080	7681080	And after we left the conference
7681080	7683080	and went home, he said, we have to hurry.
7683080	7685080	I mean, I'm old now, but if we can't do it,
7685080	7687080	this generation can't do it,
7687080	7689080	because they know less than we do.
7691080	7693080	And this thing that you
7693080	7695080	realize at some point, when I was young,
7695080	7697080	I had the impression that a lot
7697080	7699080	happened in cognitive science, that there was
7699080	7701080	an extremely high frequency with which
7701080	7703080	you had groundbreaking new insights
7703080	7705080	that came in that changed everything.
7705080	7707080	And now I have the impression
7707080	7709080	that every generation still has to
7709080	7711080	make all the mistakes of the previous generation
7711080	7713080	again, because you can
7713080	7715080	make things so difficult for yourself.
7715080	7717080	And finally, to make progress,
7717080	7719080	you as an individual
7719080	7721080	have to dig yourself down a little bit
7721080	7723080	from the basics and then come back
7723080	7725080	to the limit and rebuild something at the limit.
7725080	7727080	And this process takes so long
7727080	7729080	that there is not always a shortcut.
7729080	7731080	And you can't
7731080	7733080	rely on others
7733080	7735080	because there are so many schools
7735080	7737080	that don't have a clear picture
7737080	7739080	of their basics, or there are individuals
7739080	7741080	that don't have a clear picture of their basics.
7741080	7743080	And in computer science and mathematics
7743080	7745080	it is even easier.
7745080	7747080	In other sciences it is much more difficult.
7747080	7749080	So, in short,
7749080	7751080	the reason why
7751080	7753080	there is no agreement about it,
7753080	7755080	not even in mathematics itself,
7755080	7757080	but also not about the different
7757080	7759080	branches of philosophy or
7759080	7761080	of science or of social
7761080	7763080	flow that you try to recognize,
7763080	7765080	is the Tower of Babel.
7765080	7767080	The Tower of Babel is the idea that
7767080	7769080	we are able to build
7769080	7771080	the only building
7771080	7773080	that conquers the entire sky.
7773080	7775080	And the meaning of Heavens
7775080	7777080	back then was different
7777080	7779080	than what we understood later.
7779080	7781080	Today we translate Heavens
7781080	7783080	as an imaginary place that exists
7783080	7785080	in a superstitious way
7785080	7787080	and in which non-existent
7787080	7789080	supernatural agents stay.
7789080	7791080	God and angels and
7791080	7793080	the souls of the dead
7793080	7795080	or whatever.
7795080	7797080	And I think that this is a
7797080	7799080	very important point.
7799080	7801080	Also a part of the Tower of Babel.
7801080	7803080	Where Heaven and Earth
7803080	7805080	first appear is in Genesis
7805080	7807080	and it describes
7807080	7809080	that consciousness
7809080	7811080	is hanging over the substrate
7811080	7813080	and I think that happens
7813080	7815080	in every single one of us.
7815080	7817080	And the border in the substrate
7817080	7819080	is between the world model and the idea sphere.
7819080	7821080	And we realize that
7821080	7823080	in our mind there is a world model
7823080	7825080	that is what we perceive as stuff in space
7825080	7827080	not in the physical sense
7827080	7829080	but in the sense where we see people
7829080	7831080	with geometry and colors and ideas
7831080	7833080	and thoughts that touch things.
7833080	7835080	This stuff in space is a game engine
7835080	7837080	that our brain generates.
7837080	7839080	And this is a very special kind of mental state
7839080	7841080	mental state
7841080	7843080	because it is correlated to our perception.
7843080	7845080	That means we are in resonance
7845080	7847080	with the world around us
7847080	7849080	through our nervous system
7849080	7851080	that is coupled with the world
7851080	7853080	and we build this world model
7853080	7855080	and the processes around us are tracked.
7855080	7857080	This world model is stuff in space.
7857080	7859080	And in the text of Genesis 1
7859080	7861080	they call it Earth
7861080	7863080	or world.
7863080	7865080	And the world is simply the world model.
7865080	7867080	Rest extensa
7867080	7869080	in the Dekarczian sense
7869080	7871080	is not the physics
7871080	7873080	but it is a mental state
7873080	7875080	that describes the world model.
7875080	7877080	And everything else
7877080	7879080	that we have in our mind
7879080	7881080	that is not the world model
7881080	7883080	these are the heavens, the idea spheres
7883080	7885080	the space in which we have thoughts
7885080	7887080	about the world that are temporarily
7887080	7889080	decoupled and can also be
7889080	7891080	semantically decoupled from our perception.
7891080	7893080	And in fact there are these two areas
7893080	7895080	in our spirit and in every spirit
7895080	7897080	that we know.
7897080	7899080	So every human and most complicated
7899080	7901080	animals have a world model
7901080	7903080	and a space of ideas
7903080	7905080	that cannot be directly reflected
7905080	7907080	on perception in the outer environment
7907080	7909080	or the proprioception.
7909080	7911080	And if we now go back
7911080	7913080	and think about what is heaven
7913080	7915080	that is simply the idea sphere
7915080	7917080	the noosphere.
7917080	7919080	And to bring the idea into this space
7919080	7921080	is the project of the tower
7921080	7923080	to Babel in this myth.
7923080	7925080	And this project failed
7925080	7927080	because the people
7927080	7929080	did not manage to find a common language
7929080	7931080	that remained coherent.
7931080	7933080	The more people worked on it
7933080	7935080	the more special the languages were
7935080	7937080	and the more difficult they were to translate.
7937080	7939080	And that is why the tower fell apart.
7939080	7941080	So the whole tower broke apart.
7941080	7943080	God guided her somehow
7943080	7945080	or gave her the language
7945080	7947080	that she could no longer understand.
7947080	7949080	He somehow found the project dangerous.
7949080	7951080	How is that?
7951080	7953080	It can be.
7953080	7955080	But logically it is the case that
7955080	7957080	the churches have the impression
7957080	7959080	that the rationalists are trying
7959080	7961080	to explain the world and forget God
7961080	7963080	and can no longer explain
7963080	7965080	and therefore cannot
7965080	7967080	underline the world.
7967080	7969080	And if we take our original definition
7969080	7971080	of God from earlier
7971080	7973080	from this afternoon
7973080	7975080	then it was the small written God
7975080	7977080	the general gods
7977080	7979080	are simply themselves
7979080	7981080	that surround different spirits
7981080	7983080	and the big written God
7983080	7985080	is the total God
7985080	7987080	the greatest, best God
7987080	7989080	that we can construct.
7989080	7991080	And if we build a civilization
7991080	7993080	like ours, then it works by doing
7993080	7995080	even if no one is watching.
7995080	7997080	That is, the agent that we build together
7997080	7999080	the system of agency
7999080	8001080	that we create together
8001080	8003080	the system in which we control the future together
8003080	8005080	in the most harmonious possible way
8005080	8007080	that is God.
8007080	8009080	God is created by the fact that we recognize
8009080	8011080	that it makes sense to seek harmony
8011080	8013080	that we make our behavior
8013080	8015080	so coherent with each other
8015080	8017080	as we make our behavior so coherent
8017080	8019080	in our own spirit
8019080	8021080	that our hands do something together
8021080	8023080	In a way, a society should ideally work
8023080	8025080	in such a way that the individuals
8025080	8027080	do not work against each other
8027080	8029080	but are coherent.
8029080	8031080	But they are not coherent to do something similar
8031080	8033080	but coherent according to the best possible
8033080	8035080	set of structural principles
8035080	8037080	that can be discovered.
8037080	8039080	And that is what the churches
8039080	8041080	try to stabilize.
8041080	8043080	That is, they try to practically synchronize
8043080	8045080	the gods with the people
8045080	8047080	so that at the end a civilization is created
8047080	8049080	that is harmonious
8049080	8051080	and that the best possible survival
8051080	8053080	and the longest possible survival is possible for us.
8053080	8055080	That is the idea behind it.
8055080	8057080	And the scientists often do not recognize that.
8057080	8059080	And possibly the message
8059080	8061080	why the story of the tower of Babel
8061080	8063080	is told like that
8063080	8065080	it is not only told as an observation
8065080	8067080	but as a normative
8067080	8069080	there is a message in it that God wants to send to the people
8069080	8071080	is that if you believe too much
8071080	8073080	in what you do in your private languages
8073080	8075080	then at the end there is no coherent system
8075080	8077080	that breaks together in your civilization.
8079080	8081080	The interpretation is that
8081080	8083080	I do not agree with the text.
8083080	8085080	The thing is that there are computational languages
8085080	8087080	that did not discover them back then.
8087080	8089080	They did not discover the theory of the Church
8089080	8091080	they did not discover that they are all equally powerful.
8091080	8093080	And today we find that out.
8093080	8095080	We find out why it is possible
8095080	8097080	that our own spirit agrees with itself on a language
8097080	8099080	and how it would be conceivable
8099080	8101080	that one finds a harmonization
8101080	8103080	over all possible spirits
8103080	8105080	who are able to think so far
8105080	8107080	that they can shape the foundations of their own thinking
8107080	8109080	in the space of all metaphysics
8109080	8111080	and find out which metaphysics
8111080	8113080	can work
8113080	8115080	build a metametaphysics
8115080	8117080	from which one can derive all possible world models
8117080	8119080	which are coherent in themselves
8119080	8121080	and translate them into human beings.
8123080	8125080	A short question, how is it with the light?
8125080	8127080	It glows interesting
8127080	8129080	but it is not a big problem
8129080	8131080	because in front of me there are various microphones
8131080	8133080	that I can use in between.
8133080	8135080	How does it look on the camera?
8135080	8137080	We can also do it like this
8137080	8139080	that we turn the table
8139080	8141080	with 90 degrees
8141080	8143080	then the sun comes from the side.
8143080	8145080	This meme is for me
8145080	8147080	a strange thing
8147080	8149080	when you express it here and say
8149080	8151080	Franz that you want to hang it on the kitchen wall.
8151080	8153080	For me it was more of a fleeting thing
8153080	8155080	that you quickly
8155080	8157080	produce within a few minutes.
8157080	8159080	But it is a bit like that from the ...
8159080	8161080	That's why I think it's so good
8161080	8163080	because these are memes.
8163080	8165080	It is this fleeting meme-like
8165080	8167080	but there is so beautiful
8167080	8169080	idea space in it
8169080	8171080	and this combination makes it
8171080	8173080	my favorite meme so far.
8173080	8175080	The thing is that you ...
8175080	8177080	The memes work because
8177080	8179080	they capture something so quickly
8179080	8181080	but what they capture is sometimes quite complex.
8181080	8183080	For me the meme is a bit like
8183080	8185080	the famous Chinese painter
8185080	8187080	who is commissioned by the king
8187080	8189080	to paint birds
8189080	8191080	and he
8191080	8193080	sits there all the time
8193080	8195080	and sketches and throws away
8195080	8197080	and sketches and throws away and so on and so forth
8197080	8199080	and then the king comes to him and says to him
8199080	8201080	where is the bird that you should paint for me?
8201080	8203080	And the artist
8203080	8205080	sits down, takes a fresh sheet of paper
8205080	8207080	takes his brush and makes
8207080	8209080	a complex stroke and has the bird.
8209080	8211080	And the king is super
8211080	8213080	disappointed and says
8213080	8215080	why? You just did it so quickly.
8215080	8217080	What is the thing?
8217080	8219080	And he says, no, to make it
8219080	8221080	I had to become the one who can do it all.
8221080	8223080	And for me it is also like that.
8223080	8225080	For me it is the result of
8225080	8227080	thinking about all the stuff for several decades
8227080	8229080	and then trying to draw my own path
8229080	8231080	and to think about
8231080	8233080	which steps I have come up with.
8233080	8235080	And of course it is not the only
8235080	8237080	possible path and probably
8237080	8239080	not the end of the path because many details are missing.
8239080	8241080	But it is interesting to
8241080	8243080	get to know yourself.
8243080	8245080	And the great thing about this medium Twitter
8245080	8247080	is that you ...
8247080	8249080	that there are so many people on it
8249080	8251080	that you can develop very special thoughts.
8251080	8253080	And then when you
8253080	8255080	train your followers accordingly
8255080	8257080	so that they are able to get along with it
8257080	8259080	you just have among your
8259080	8261080	tens of thousands of followers always some
8261080	8263080	who can get along with your thoughts and who can interface
8263080	8265080	and can bring you further into the discussion.
8267080	8269080	And here you also have to shout out
8269080	8271080	to the expanding brain thing itself
8271080	8273080	because it really fits on it
8273080	8275080	so I sometimes still get such jitters
8275080	8277080	when I only concentrate on the pictures
8277080	8279080	together with what is there
8279080	8281080	and then it's always ...
8281080	8283080	well.
8283080	8285080	Yes, it was just such a spiritual ...
8285080	8287080	it fits together so well that I quickly tap it down
8287080	8289080	and put it on Twitter.
8291080	8293080	It is also interesting because for me I would say
8293080	8295080	if I had to think about
8295080	8297080	what my intellectual
8297080	8299080	trajectory has most influenced
8299080	8301080	then it was probably
8301080	8303080	this nerd Twitter bubble
8303080	8305080	and for most people
8305080	8307080	Twitter is not the place
8307080	8309080	where you think you can find knowledge
8309080	8311080	because at the same time so many nerdy things happen
8311080	8313080	but also so beautiful.
8313080	8315080	Sure, as soon as I get out of my filter bubble
8315080	8317080	it gets uncomfortable.
8317080	8319080	Some people think that filter bubble is something totally bad
8319080	8321080	but filter bubble is the equivalent
8321080	8323080	of a room in which you
8323080	8325080	can play a concert, for example.
8325080	8327080	Another is a box match, another is a kindergarten
8327080	8329080	and another is a
8329080	8331080	theater play and they can all
8331080	8333080	only work because they are separated
8333080	8335080	and because they can separate
8335080	8337080	for the duration of the performance.
8339080	8341080	We wrote a few more comments about this meme
8341080	8343080	which was also
8343080	8345080	part of the experience
8345080	8347080	when the meme was aired on Twitter.
8349080	8351080	One comment below was
8351080	8353080	there is no independent truth
8353080	8355080	then you answered welcome to level 2
8355080	8357080	and the person answered with a smiley
8357080	8359080	got me.
8359080	8361080	Very nice interaction.
8361080	8363080	At level 1 you think
8363080	8365080	that logic is absolute
8365080	8367080	and at level 2 you can see
8367080	8369080	that the logic depends on
8369080	8371080	the definition in the action system.
8371080	8373080	We have not yet come to the point
8373080	8375080	where we can have any action system
8375080	8377080	which is not available
8377080	8379080	so it is only level 2.
8381080	8383080	What did you answer with level 3?
8385080	8387080	What is that?
8389080	8391080	What is the definition in a formal language?
8391080	8393080	It can be defined in any way we want.
8413080	8415080	What if the universe contains
8415080	8417080	non-computable processes?
8417080	8419080	Computation with general
8419080	8421080	real-valued variables?
8421080	8423080	Level 3.
8423080	8425080	At this point we have not
8425080	8427080	taken the step to constructive mathematics
8427080	8429080	and believe that
8429080	8431080	languages that are not implementable
8431080	8433080	are suitable to
8433080	8435080	describe truth in such a way
8435080	8437080	that you can claim that all these things exist.
8437080	8439080	Truth
8439080	8441080	that can work with it
8441080	8443080	must exist in the form
8443080	8445080	that is, it must be implementable
8445080	8447080	that is, it is pre-computationalist.
8467080	8469080	Exactly, it is the case that
8469080	8471080	he took the kettlebell
8471080	8473080	but he has not yet come out
8473080	8475080	and has understood the consequence.
8475080	8477080	That is, he is exactly at the point
8477080	8479080	where he sees that these languages
8479080	8481080	that he uses to describe reality
8481080	8483080	are running in boundaries
8483080	8485080	because they run in self-contradictions
8485080	8487080	and that means that the reality he builds with
8487080	8489080	does not end and he does not see the way out of it.
8503080	8505080	Universe is a computer
8505080	8507080	but that we can build universal computers
8507080	8509080	capable of simulating any physical system.
8509080	8511080	Thoughts?
8511080	8513080	Level 4.
8533080	8535080	That he has not yet taken the step
8535080	8537080	to recognize that
8537080	8539080	the pre-computational languages
8539080	8541080	are running in contradictions.
8541080	8543080	The thing is, when we accept
8543080	8545080	that nothing can be thought of
8545080	8547080	that is not computational
8547080	8549080	and nothing can be observed
8549080	8551080	then we can not even
8551080	8553080	refer to this universe
8553080	8555080	in our thoughts.
8555080	8557080	Of course, every system
8557080	8559080	in which we speak about something
8559080	8561080	can only refer to the system itself.
8561080	8563080	If we have a representation system
8563080	8565080	in which we can talk about the universe
8565080	8567080	and think about it
8567080	8569080	then we can only talk and think about
8569080	8571080	universes that can be reproduced
8571080	8573080	in the representation system.
8573080	8575080	And to claim that they can exist
8575080	8577080	does not make sense
8577080	8579080	because every alternative to the system
8579080	8581080	leads to contradictions.
8581080	8583080	That is, the systems that we can think about
8583080	8585080	and that we can claim
8585080	8587080	that it is a universe
8587080	8589080	must be in the class of systems
8589080	8591080	that can be described in languages
8591080	8593080	that are not self-contradictory
8593080	8595080	because the others are not existent.
8595080	8597080	And also not thinkable in that sense.
8597080	8599080	Yes, that's what it means.
8599080	8601080	We can not think about it
8601080	8603080	in such a way that our language does not break.
8603080	8605080	And I think that's the big thing
8605080	8607080	that still confuses people
8607080	8609080	even further.
8609080	8611080	That they somehow think, well,
8611080	8613080	it could be that it is continuous
8613080	8615080	and they still do not notice
8615080	8617080	that the idea of continuous
8617080	8619080	has the same meaning
8619080	8621080	as a direct contradiction at the end.
8621080	8623080	Yes, but each of these ideas has confused me
8623080	8625080	for a long time.
8625080	8627080	For me it is really a progression
8627080	8629080	that I have made myself
8629080	8631080	because I had to find out why it is so and so.
8631080	8633080	And I did not have the feeling
8633080	8635080	that someone helped me, but on the contrary.
8635080	8637080	I tried to get it out
8637080	8639080	against the institutions
8639080	8641080	that explained to me that they are the axioms
8641080	8643080	and I realize, no,
8643080	8645080	your identity concept is not mine
8645080	8647080	because it does not work that way
8647080	8649080	when I try to think.
8667080	8669080	This is a complicated question.
8669080	8671080	The thing is that on the lowest level
8671080	8673080	where we do not need a memory,
8673080	8675080	so to speak, and the universe
8675080	8677080	only exists as a condition
8677080	8679080	in the space of the possible,
8679080	8681080	the question is, is there
8681080	8683080	a limitation?
8683080	8685080	So is the possible
8685080	8687080	limited by something?
8687080	8689080	Or if there is boundlessness
8689080	8691080	on the lowest level of the possibility,
8691080	8693080	then of course it leads
8693080	8695080	to an infinity.
8695080	8697080	It is just that the operators
8697080	8699080	who work on it
8699080	8701080	usually cannot lead to structures
8701080	8703080	that inevitably integrate many elements
8703080	8705080	from one step to the next.
8705080	8707080	And that means
8707080	8709080	that there is a limit
8709080	8711080	where the question for me
8711080	8713080	is not clear and I suspect
8713080	8715080	that the unboundedness
8715080	8717080	on the lowest level, because we do not
8717080	8719080	need a memory and no sequential
8719080	8721080	addition of operations,
8721080	8723080	theoretically could lead to an infinity.
8723080	8725080	But it is not
8725080	8727080	a constructive infinity.
8727080	8729080	That is, wherever we accept that the universe
8729080	8731080	is constructive, where we describe things
8731080	8733080	as transitions through other things
8733080	8735080	and the world in which
8735080	8737080	we have, for example, information
8737080	8739080	and structure formation,
8739080	8741080	wherever information and structure
8741080	8743080	formation play a role, it probably
8743080	8745080	cannot work.
8745080	8747080	And that is something where I
8747080	8749080	do not see the clear proof. I have the impression
8749080	8751080	that I see it, but I cannot
8751080	8753080	write it down formally. That is why
8753080	8755080	it is so that I hallucinate it.
8755080	8757080	But then I have another question, if you
8757080	8759080	talk about the lowest possible level
8759080	8761080	where the unboundedness becomes a real infinity,
8761080	8763080	then we get the same
8763080	8765080	problems, or that you
8765080	8767080	simply cannot keep the concept infinity
8767080	8769080	up at all, because if you look closely,
8769080	8771080	it is exactly the same.
8771080	8773080	It is above all the next
8773080	8775080	problem is that I cannot talk about it,
8775080	8777080	that is, I cannot think about it. And since I
8777080	8779080	cannot think about it, it cannot
8779080	8781080	be claimed in any way
8781080	8783080	that we are in it.
8783080	8785080	Because I cannot refer to the thing where
8785080	8787080	we are supposed to be in it.
8787080	8789080	I always imagine that when I have
8789080	8791080	continual ideas about
8791080	8793080	the universe, or space, or time,
8793080	8795080	I simply replace it with
8795080	8797080	x and not x. And then I say
8797080	8799080	that what I am currently thinking
8799080	8801080	about has exactly the same
8801080	8803080	meaning as this. It is simply
8803080	8805080	another token for contradiction.
8805080	8807080	And that is it.
8807080	8809080	But that is something where I say,
8809080	8811080	as far as I understand it logically,
8811080	8813080	there is no possibility that we are in
8813080	8815080	the universe. But it is also the case
8815080	8817080	that when I go through my one progression,
8817080	8819080	through these steps, it was often the case
8819080	8821080	that I am at a point where I say
8821080	8823080	I cannot logically understand why
8823080	8825080	there is something, instead of something else.
8825080	8827080	This question seems, in principle,
8827080	8829080	unanswerable.
8829080	8831080	And that confused me, because I thought
8831080	8833080	how can it be that there are questions that
8833080	8835080	are unanswered, because you can always find a curve.
8835080	8837080	And at some point you
8837080	8839080	realize, oh, there is this
8839080	8841080	solution. But that also shows
8841080	8843080	how fragile our own thinking is
8843080	8845080	and how unreliable it is.
8845080	8847080	And in the end, unfortunately,
8847080	8849080	that is something that we have to leave to the machines.
8853080	8855080	I wanted to read a quote from Einstein
8855080	8857080	where I wonder
8857080	8859080	if he describes
8859080	8861080	similar problems.
8861080	8863080	I had that in a planning concept, but I don't know
8863080	8865080	if you read it in such detail.
8865080	8867080	Einstein on the discreteness of space-time.
8867080	8869080	But you have correctly
8869080	8871080	grasped
8871080	8873080	the drawback
8873080	8875080	that the continuum brings.
8875080	8877080	If the molecular view of
8877080	8879080	matter is the correct
8879080	8881080	and appropriate one, that is,
8881080	8883080	if a part of the universe
8883080	8885080	is to be represented by a finite number
8885080	8887080	of moving points,
8887080	8889080	then the continuum
8889080	8891080	of the present theory contains
8891080	8893080	too great a manifold of possibilities.
8893080	8895080	I also believe
8895080	8897080	that this too great
8897080	8899080	is responsible for the fact
8899080	8901080	that our present means of description
8901080	8903080	miscarry with the quantum theory.
8903080	8905080	The problem seems to me
8905080	8907080	how one can formulate statements
8907080	8909080	about a discontinuum
8909080	8911080	without calling
8911080	8913080	upon a continuum
8913080	8915080	as an aid.
8915080	8917080	The letter, the continuum,
8917080	8919080	should be banned from the theory
8919080	8921080	as a supplementary construction
8921080	8923080	not justified by the essence
8923080	8925080	of the problem, which corresponds
8925080	8927080	to nothing real.
8927080	8929080	But we still lack
8929080	8931080	the mathematical structure, unfortunately.
8931080	8933080	How much have I already
8933080	8935080	plagued myself in this way?
8955080	8957080	The idea that one
8957080	8959080	can assemble the universe
8959080	8961080	from discrete units,
8961080	8963080	but the idea that one
8963080	8965080	derives geometry from discrete
8965080	8967080	operations, from quantum theory
8967080	8969080	and so on and so forth,
8969080	8971080	he probably didn't have any tools for that.
8971080	8973080	And even now it's problematic.
8973080	8975080	Wolfram tries to do that,
8975080	8977080	but it's not trivial.
8977080	8979080	I don't know how much mathematics
8979080	8981080	is in this area, but Einstein
8981080	8983080	has seen this possibility.
8983080	8985080	He has been confronted with the fact
8985080	8987080	that there are singularities in space-time.
8987080	8989080	And singularities
8989080	8991080	are nothing positive.
8991080	8993080	That is, that the mathematical description
8993080	8995080	no longer works, that you
8995080	8997080	practically get a division by zero
8997080	8999080	and the value is no longer valid
8999080	9001080	that you get.
9001080	9003080	So singularity means
9003080	9005080	that practically the dimensions
9005080	9007080	in which a model is described
9007080	9009080	are not sufficient to
9009080	9011080	grasp the dynamics of the model.
9011080	9013080	And he then noticed
9013080	9015080	that one can push the singularities
9015080	9017080	in space-time around,
9017080	9019080	i.e. these places where space-time
9019080	9021080	breaks down and then practically push them
9021080	9023080	into the middle of masses.
9023080	9025080	And that means that in the middle of masses
9025080	9027080	there is a point where space-time
9027080	9029080	no longer really works, but maybe
9029080	9031080	it's not that bad, maybe it has to do with
9031080	9033080	how space-time is knotted in a certain way
9033080	9035080	and runs out of the rudder.
9035080	9037080	But he was confronted with it relatively early
9037080	9039080	that the possibility exists that
9039080	9041080	the space-time description that he makes,
9041080	9043080	i.e. the continuous geometric space-time
9043080	9045080	is not suitable to describe the absolute
9045080	9047080	basics of physics.
9047080	9049080	And the other thing is this confrontation
9049080	9051080	with the quantization of the universe
9051080	9053080	that he saw relatively early.
9053080	9055080	Einstein was a very broad thinker
9055080	9057080	who did not focus on a certain idea
9057080	9059080	because he knew
9059080	9061080	how he made his ideas.
9061080	9063080	He was not a member, he was not a type
9063080	9065080	whose theories came about
9065080	9067080	that he took over from other teachers
9067080	9069080	that he did not modify easily.
9069080	9071080	Instead, he is someone who has invented
9071080	9073080	these ideas all by himself and together with
9073080	9075080	other people who have also invented ideas
9075080	9077080	that were discussed about it.
9077080	9079080	That is, it is a completely different approach
9079080	9081080	than what scientists experience today
9081080	9083080	who practically think about subpar themes.
9083080	9085080	That is, they marry into a school from the beginning
9085080	9087080	and try to take over the concepts
9087080	9089080	and try to understand as well as possible,
9089080	9091080	to make them fit and then add an epsilon.
9091080	9093080	So since it was clear to him
9093080	9095080	that he had invented this continuous space-time
