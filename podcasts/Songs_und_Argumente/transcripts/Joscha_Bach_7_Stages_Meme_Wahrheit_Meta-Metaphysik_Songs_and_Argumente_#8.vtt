01:00.000 --> 01:26.520
So, for me, it was with the Meme that I had this ghostly flash and thought, okay, I notice

01:26.520 --> 01:31.760
that when I look back, I had a certain intellectual development and it's not quite

01:31.760 --> 01:36.240
like it's in the memes, but it's such a thing that I also notice with other people

01:36.240 --> 01:42.040
when they think about how logic works. And I thought, okay, we could just

01:42.040 --> 01:46.560
express it with this meme as if it were a journey. And of course it's not a

01:46.560 --> 01:51.480
journey, but it's more of a branch out into different branches and then you end up in

01:51.480 --> 01:55.640
different areas of the meaning space. But for myself, of course, I can

01:55.640 --> 02:01.880
understand my own path. And this first step is one that I haven't stayed in for a long time.

02:01.880 --> 02:07.440
It's about two and a half thousand years old and goes back to Plato and Aristotle. And these

02:07.440 --> 02:14.320
three laws of logic or laws of thought are derived from the syllogisms, i.e. from the forms

02:14.320 --> 02:18.360
in which linguistic logic worked, from the point of view of Aristotle, who tried to

02:18.360 --> 02:23.200
systematize it. And if you look at it from today's point of view, i.e. with the terms of logic

02:23.200 --> 02:28.400
of Tarski and others, then you have the impression that he was right about 80 percent, which is

02:28.400 --> 02:33.440
somehow much better than most contemporary philosophers, so not so bad. And the three

02:33.440 --> 02:40.800
rules he describes are on the one hand the law of identity and almost identity so that a thing

02:40.800 --> 02:47.120
cannot be itself if you do something about it or take it away. And that every thing

02:47.120 --> 02:52.240
has to be self-identical for all things. This is an action with which you can describe identity.

02:52.240 --> 02:58.120
And the next thing is that he says that a thing cannot be true and false at the same time.

02:58.120 --> 03:05.320
So a statement, a statement, a proposition can either be true or false. And the next thing is,

03:05.320 --> 03:07.920
every statement must be either true or false.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.000
Then we get problems afterwards.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.320
Yes, exactly. And I also had problems with all of these things, because at first it

03:14.320 --> 03:18.840
looks like it would work, but I looked at my own thinking and found that

03:18.920 --> 03:23.320
it was not like that in my own thinking. And one thing that I noticed is, for example,

03:23.320 --> 03:28.000
that it starts with identity. When I try to describe things about their identity,

03:28.000 --> 03:33.240
for example when I write a computer program, then it does not capture how identity really is.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.280
So, for example, when I play a computer game myself, when are two objects in this

03:37.280 --> 03:41.720
computer game identical from the point of view of the player? For example, two trees. I can, for example,

03:41.720 --> 03:46.000
define an object in a computer game in the same way as the tree that I then use several times in the

03:46.080 --> 03:51.160
computer game and put it in there. Is that the same tree or is it another tree if it has different

03:51.160 --> 03:55.960
coordinates? That depends on the context. So I can say that it is the same tree that I

03:55.960 --> 04:00.280
encounter several times or there are different trees that only look the same by chance.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.080
Well, you want a functional description level and on certain selected description levels

04:05.080 --> 04:09.920
it is the same, but it already seems to you that if you keep zooming out in the

04:09.920 --> 04:13.240
description, then at some point it is no longer identical, no matter what you want.

04:13.400 --> 04:19.680
There is also this famous ship of the T-Seus, which is such a philosophical paradox that

04:19.680 --> 04:25.720
philosophers like to dig up. It is about the T-Seus building a ship and

04:25.720 --> 04:29.640
that at some point it sank in the Mediterranean and it was so salty all around that it

04:29.640 --> 04:33.360
remained relatively well preserved. And the archaeologists then pull it out at some point,

04:33.360 --> 04:38.560
it is of course somehow weathered and they decide to restore it and take the

04:38.560 --> 04:43.120
individual boards off the ship and replace them with new boards of the same shape and

04:43.120 --> 04:47.560
color. And gradually the ship is restored and looks the same as before and

04:47.560 --> 04:52.120
next to it is a pile of boards. And that is the same ship as before, just renewed. And now

04:52.120 --> 04:55.920
someone else comes and takes this pile of boards and builds the original ship

04:55.920 --> 05:01.160
together again. And what is the ship of the T-Seus? Intuitively, it is

05:01.160 --> 05:05.720
not that easy to find out in which branch we are now entering. And what we

05:05.720 --> 05:10.080
find out is that this identity is not at all a natural category, but a

05:10.080 --> 05:15.240
cognitive category that we apply under certain conditions. And what these

05:15.240 --> 05:20.240
concepts, what these identities are all together is, from my point of view, that we add a world

05:20.240 --> 05:29.520
line to the thing. So we say that this object exists with a series of instances in time and

05:29.520 --> 05:35.040
we therefore bind the instances of this object into one single object. And what is important

05:35.040 --> 05:38.720
is not that it is identical in nature, but only that they share the identity. So this

05:38.760 --> 05:42.440
property of identity and that means in principle have to have a kind of common

05:42.440 --> 05:47.280
biography. And this attribution of the biography, i.e. an imaginary property,

05:47.280 --> 05:52.120
which objects have together over time or over different observations,

05:52.120 --> 05:57.960
that is the essence of the identity in the way I use it in my head. And this

05:57.960 --> 06:00.800
equality of property, which I have, for example, in a certain logical system,

06:00.800 --> 06:04.680
that these are two objects that are identical when they share all properties, is a much

06:04.680 --> 06:12.120
narrower form of identity that I can submit to the thing, i.e. to my identity concept,

06:12.120 --> 06:18.360
but only under certain conditions. We see that we can define identity in different ways

06:18.360 --> 06:22.200
and from this we get different mathematical concepts in which identity can exist.

06:22.200 --> 06:28.320
The next thing can be true or false. For example, I could say I have a variable

06:28.320 --> 06:32.440
in a computer program and that is a variable that can contain bulges, i.e. a truth value,

06:32.600 --> 06:38.320
binaries in this case, which you can have, for example, a logical true or false. And I can

06:38.320 --> 06:43.000
also define a ternary logic, i.e. which I have true and false and undetermined,

06:43.000 --> 06:48.960
or a probabilistic logic in which I have 100 percent or zero as true and false and the

06:48.960 --> 06:54.880
things in between are then further logic values. And in our own head we realize

06:54.880 --> 06:58.840
that we can use different such logics and convert between them under certain conditions.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.440
So a logic that is binary and only knows true and false and a logic that is true,

07:03.440 --> 07:09.440
false and undetermined. And that with the excluded third is even more complicated,

07:09.440 --> 07:16.080
because this logic works what Gödel has found out under certain conditions no longer.

07:16.080 --> 07:21.560
That is, these original laws of logic do not allow these axioms to be

07:21.560 --> 07:24.280
maintained under all conditions. For example, when I allow infinity,

07:24.280 --> 07:28.360
when I look at many features that lead to contradictions. And that was for Gödel,

07:28.840 --> 07:33.560
who thought that he could maintain the axioms, a catastrophe. But for a computer scientist

07:33.560 --> 07:36.520
this is not such a big problem, because the computer scientist says, okay,

07:36.520 --> 07:42.600
in this programming language I define my logic and my true and false in a very specific way.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.440
And that leads to the fact that I have the opportunity to calculate what I think in

07:47.440 --> 07:53.560
these and all conditions for true and false. There are still essays in which it is done as

07:53.560 --> 07:58.520
these three laws of thinking are absolutely elementary. And then maybe a fourth,

07:58.520 --> 08:02.920
that it is all basic. So, for example, biological organisms have the ability to

08:02.920 --> 08:08.240
compare things and all this is derived from them. And maybe it's very deep-seated,

08:08.240 --> 08:11.400
but from my point of view it doesn't seem deep-seated. I have the impression that it doesn't

08:11.400 --> 08:13.320
lead very far, I can't build a mind out of it.

08:23.560 --> 08:43.800
Logic cannot provide absolute truth, because it is based on unprovable axioms.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.640
Then it's not 2 and 2, 4, but 2 and 2 is 5. So maybe I could take an axiom system

08:58.640 --> 09:02.160
that works like that. And that's the next step you could take in your thinking,

09:02.160 --> 09:08.120
that you discover that mathematics and logic are in some way popular, that you can simply

09:08.120 --> 09:13.280
derive another logic from it if you use other rules. But that doesn't necessarily

09:13.280 --> 09:19.120
lead far in the end, because most of these logics are not very interesting, in the sense that they

09:19.120 --> 09:23.120
don't lead to interesting structures. Namely, not to structures with which I can describe

09:23.120 --> 09:29.280
any reality or interesting system. And the logics, the interesting

09:29.280 --> 09:33.240
structure forms with which I can describe worlds and arithmetic and so on,

09:33.240 --> 09:36.080
there are relatively few of them.

09:49.120 --> 10:13.240
Level 3. Truth depends on its consistent definition in a formal language. It can be

10:13.240 --> 10:15.320
defined in any way we want.

10:15.320 --> 10:21.640
As far as I understand it, that means that the truth is a predicate that we

10:21.640 --> 10:31.560
assign entities in our language. Is that right? What do you think I don't understand then?

10:31.560 --> 10:34.560
What do you think people should understand in order to reach level 3?

10:34.560 --> 10:43.000
There are often discussions at a place where people say define truth. And then you can

10:43.160 --> 10:50.800
refer to Stanford and Cyclopedia on philosophy, or to Wikipedia, or to a number of other websites,

10:50.800 --> 10:59.160
or to certain works by logicians, for example Tarski. And what we find is that they had

10:59.160 --> 11:03.480
a few approaches to logic. In philosophy, for example, there are correspondence theories

11:03.480 --> 11:08.880
that say that things become true by referring to facts in the real world. But then the

11:08.880 --> 11:13.800
question arises, what is actually a fact in the real world? Or there are coherence theories

11:13.800 --> 11:19.440
where you say something is true, when all statements that have a claim to truth are

11:19.440 --> 11:23.480
coherent with each other in a system. That means that there are no constraints.

11:23.480 --> 11:29.640
And usually these systems are not very precisely defined. And the really precise

11:29.640 --> 11:36.880
definitions usually exist in formal logic. And the main traditions use axioms

11:36.880 --> 11:42.480
that often lead to contradictions, for example, if you look at the Goethe proof,

11:42.480 --> 11:50.080
or Tarski's undefinability theorem, which is related to the Goethe set of incompleteness.

11:50.080 --> 11:57.120
I think I'd rather not go into detail. I think it is more important that we first

11:57.120 --> 12:04.680
become aware of what a language can say about the world. And in this tradition

12:04.720 --> 12:08.160
in which we are right now, it is the case that a language cannot say anything about a world

12:08.160 --> 12:13.360
outside of itself. That is different from natural languages, because the natural

12:13.360 --> 12:17.760
languages ​​that we use to communicate with each other say something about a perceptual

12:17.760 --> 12:21.960
world and about a mentally represented world that is not captured in the natural language at all,

12:21.960 --> 12:28.160
but which can show the natural language. And we share enough of this language of thinking

12:28.400 --> 12:36.400
in which we can depict perceptions, so that it is good enough to show. But in the end,

12:36.400 --> 12:40.840
we cannot prove that we are talking about the same thing if we only show, because we do not know

12:40.840 --> 12:47.200
what the other person is showing. And in formal logic you try to exclude that. And the hope

12:47.200 --> 12:53.040
is that what exists in the perceptual world can be depicted in a logical language. And

12:53.040 --> 12:57.200
it is also necessary that I get the whole world into this logical language. And

12:57.240 --> 13:03.280
what Gödel has found out is that the actions he has taken lead to contradictions. That

13:03.280 --> 13:08.000
means I cannot build a machine in mathematics that allows this specification of the language that

13:08.000 --> 13:14.680
Gödel has used to run without this machine flying around your ears,

13:14.680 --> 13:20.720
so that this computer crashes. And it is because the actions that he has used

13:20.720 --> 13:27.320
to run without this machine that the logic is state-free. This means that the truth exists

13:27.320 --> 13:33.480
regardless of the processing process of a program. So you do not have to be determined step by step

13:33.480 --> 13:40.560
with the algorithm, but in total. This state-freedom of mathematics has a very good

13:40.560 --> 13:44.640
property, which is why the mathematicians who want to have it, they allow me to deal with

13:44.640 --> 13:50.560
infinity. If I have to describe everything step by step, then I know how to do it,

13:50.720 --> 13:54.880
and I can decompose and put it together, i.e. conduct constructive mathematics.

13:54.880 --> 14:00.360
But the disadvantage is that I never get to infinity. I can only add step by step,

14:00.360 --> 14:04.960
but something like pi, for example, i.e. a number with an infinite number of places,

14:04.960 --> 14:09.200
I can never completely describe in this way. And that means I can

14:09.200 --> 14:14.640
create a system that runs continuously and, for example, emits a wave. And the wave

14:14.640 --> 14:20.000
is a periodic process, that is, a circle that is pulled apart over time.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.480
Pi has to be known until the end, so that the wave can run completely when the

14:24.480 --> 14:29.680
world is continuous. And that means if I want to describe such a world in my logic,

14:29.680 --> 14:35.280
then I have to deal with infinity and continuity. And that's all I can do

14:35.280 --> 14:40.160
if I have functions that take up an infinite number of bits at once as an argument,

14:40.160 --> 14:44.080
and then perform operations over this infinite number of bits at once, and in the end

14:44.080 --> 14:48.080
also be able to output an infinite number of bits again. If I want to do this step by step,

14:48.160 --> 14:55.040
it doesn't work. And what Gödel found out is that the assumptions that he had about

14:55.040 --> 14:59.520
truth in this language lead to contradictions. And how did he do that?

15:00.480 --> 15:05.360
He first found out that the language should not refer to the outside world,

15:05.360 --> 15:10.800
but it should build everything in itself. And if the language can only refer to things in itself,

15:10.800 --> 15:14.400
then you can't talk about yourself. And that's a problem. How can I

15:14.560 --> 15:18.800
make the language talk about itself? And the solution is that I have to build the language

15:18.800 --> 15:24.320
in itself. So the language has to be so powerful that it can build itself from scratch and that

15:24.320 --> 15:29.600
performance can build itself. In order to do that, in order for a language to be executed,

15:29.600 --> 15:36.080
I need a computer, a system that can, so to speak, go from one step to the next

15:36.080 --> 15:42.720
step. When Gödel did that, that was at the beginning of the 30s,

15:43.440 --> 15:46.880
and he had already started to think about it beforehand, there was no computer yet.

15:47.680 --> 15:52.880
So he looked for one that he could take and he actually discovered one. And those were the

15:52.880 --> 15:57.920
piano axioms. The piano axioms can be derived from all the natural numbers.

15:57.920 --> 16:02.080
And the nice thing is that it's really just a handful of rules with which you can define

16:02.080 --> 16:06.000
how they look. It's basically a kind of number stream that consists of discrete units,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.240
so if one is bigger. And what you need is an operator with which you can practically

16:10.240 --> 16:14.800
take one step forward and backward. And if you use it several times, then you can define the

16:14.800 --> 16:20.080
addition as simply the repeated forward and backward. And the multiplication

16:20.080 --> 16:23.840
can be done by repeated addition. Addition, so to speak, by counting, actually. Yes,

16:23.840 --> 16:28.800
so just counting is basically this teleporting on the number stream. And I can,

16:28.880 --> 16:32.800
by not just taking one step forward and backward, but teleporting. I do that by

16:32.800 --> 16:35.840
defining an operation, a function, that simply consists of the

16:35.840 --> 16:40.640
automating of the forward and backward. And the multiplication is, so to speak,

16:40.640 --> 16:46.640
the automating of the addition, by doing that several times. And the relationship

16:46.640 --> 16:52.320
between the addition and the multiplication is the exponentialization. The cool thing is,

16:52.400 --> 17:01.200
I can define an operation with which I project the two numbers in a room and

17:01.200 --> 17:05.520
perform an addition in the room and then project it back, then with a logarithm,

17:05.520 --> 17:09.360
that's the reverse of the exponentiation, and then it's equivalent. That means,

17:09.360 --> 17:14.080
what it shows is that addition and multiplication are the same if I send them through such a

17:14.080 --> 17:19.120
projection. And this projection is the exponentiation or the logarithm back. And

17:19.120 --> 17:24.640
that means, I can build up the whole math step by step, just by taking these

17:24.640 --> 17:29.600
natural numbers. And the multiplication, so to speak, when the addition is

17:29.600 --> 17:34.160
teleporting, then it's the multiplication of zooming. I can zoom in and zoom out,

17:34.160 --> 17:37.920
and by doing that I can make numbers that are smaller than whole numbers,

17:37.920 --> 17:42.720
rational numbers. And a rational number I can describe as the ratio between

17:43.680 --> 17:51.600
two whole numbers. That's a break. And that means, just a few of the whole numbers

17:51.600 --> 17:57.120
results in any rational number. And Pythagoras hoped, that's it now,

17:57.120 --> 18:03.920
more won't come. But then he found out, and the people in his cult, in his

18:03.920 --> 18:07.760
Mathematica Club back then, that there are still irrational numbers. That means,

18:07.920 --> 18:12.400
those that unfortunately cannot be described as such, for example Pi or the root of two.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.600
And that's a terrible result, because it's the idea that you can lead the whole world from the

18:17.600 --> 18:23.680
integers, from the whole numbers, to nothing. And the legend says that this guy,

18:23.680 --> 18:28.560
who secretly betrayed the world, he shouldn't have betrayed it, he let him kill him,

18:28.560 --> 18:34.160
because it was really a secret that the world shouldn't find out. And from my point of view,

18:34.480 --> 18:42.400
Pythagoras was right. The world wasn't ready. The thing is, that the mathematicians were confused

18:42.400 --> 18:47.200
by that, because they thought there are these irrational numbers. And the computer scientists

18:47.200 --> 18:51.360
later discovered that there are these irrational numbers not as numbers, not as values,

18:51.360 --> 18:56.560
but as functions. That means, I can define such a program that calculates Pi for me,

18:56.560 --> 19:00.080
and this program does that little by little, there are more and more places for me, Pi makes me

19:00.160 --> 19:04.400
more and more precise. But it will never go to the point that it gives me the last place.

19:04.960 --> 19:10.160
And that also means that there can be no computer program from this point of view

19:10.160 --> 19:15.200
that creates a world in which a perfect circle takes place. But the circles that

19:15.200 --> 19:19.200
are described are always rounder, so to speak, but they are never completely round.

19:19.920 --> 19:25.280
And the world in which we are is not necessarily one in which round circles exist,

19:25.360 --> 19:30.000
but it is one in which, in the end, the resolution becomes smaller and smaller,

19:30.000 --> 19:35.280
but never infinitely small, but at some point the world falls apart in quantum effects.

19:35.280 --> 19:39.280
And it never becomes continuous, but it is always continuous, continuous.

19:39.280 --> 19:45.520
And from this point of view, there is no geometry. The geometry is not a real part of

19:45.520 --> 19:49.520
mathematics in the calculation, but something that exists only in the scope of approximation.

19:49.520 --> 19:54.480
That is, so to speak, the mathematics of the numbers that are too big to count them.

19:54.480 --> 19:58.400
And in an area where numbers are too big to count them, that is the world in which we

19:58.400 --> 20:03.040
are in general, where too many molecules are there to observe them individually,

20:03.760 --> 20:06.560
there are sometimes operators that, so to speak, converge at the limit.

20:07.360 --> 20:13.840
And they can be calculated efficiently. And the more the numbers get bigger,

20:13.840 --> 20:18.160
the closer you get to a certain value. And this area is exactly the geometry.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.680
And our own brain discovers a geometry to describe the world,

20:21.680 --> 20:27.200
a certain function with which we can describe continuous surfaces and waves in the ocean,

20:27.200 --> 20:32.880
and things that look like a circle and where we can zoom in at will within the resolution of our brain

20:32.880 --> 20:37.680
and can find simple algebraic expressions with which one can calculate that, so to speak.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.200
And we can also do that in computers. And from this point of view of constructive

20:41.200 --> 20:45.280
mathematics, the world is just like that. So there is no continuous mathematics.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.960
But before the calculation was discovered as a principle and the computer was discovered as a

20:48.960 --> 20:54.080
principle, mathematicians assumed that there was a continuous world.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.400
And what Gödel discovered was that this world, which we have, of course,

20:58.400 --> 21:03.200
foreseen and the languages ​​we have built for it, lead to contradictions.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.520
And that has shaken him very much. And from the point of view of computer scientists,

21:07.520 --> 21:14.880
that is not a problem at all. Now let's go back to what Gödel said.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.040
So we were at level three.

21:17.040 --> 21:21.840
So we were there, the other team was looking for a computer.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.800
The computer he found were the natural numbers.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.480
And the great thing is that he just saw that the natural numbers with which I can

21:28.480 --> 21:34.480
calculate any things. And so I can treat them as if I had a computer.

21:34.480 --> 21:38.640
How can I make logic with it? And his idea was that I can write down my logic with a

21:38.640 --> 21:42.160
formal system, i.e. as symbols, letters and characters.

21:42.240 --> 21:46.800
For example, if I make a sign for and and a sign for or and a sign for a follows from

21:46.800 --> 21:50.960
b and then I can have a sign for variables and then I have such a small alphabet.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.000
And I convert that into numbers.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.840
And ASCII code has not yet been invented, i.e. this American Standard Code of

21:57.840 --> 22:01.600
Information Interchange, which was later solved by Unicode in the computer.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.480
That's why he converted his alphabet into powers with prime numbers.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.240
It was mathematically super clever.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.320
It's called Goedelization and it's one of the main points when you try to understand

22:12.320 --> 22:17.120
the sentence by Goedel, how he exactly converted the letters into numbers.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.120
But that's not important, ASCII works just as well.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.120
With huge numbers, definitely pretty fast.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.240
Yes, but basically it's exactly like the numbers in the computer.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.280
In your computer, there are only numbers in there that are written down with b and n

22:27.280 --> 22:33.120
and you just have an alphabet that you can convert into numbers.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.560
And the cool thing about it is that you can only take these numbers and that you

22:36.640 --> 22:44.640
can develop formulas or functions that calculate your logical operations.

22:44.640 --> 22:50.640
They just say, if these and those numbers are there with which my logical expressions

22:50.640 --> 22:54.640
are written down and I calculate them together, how can I represent arithmetic,

22:54.640 --> 22:58.640
simple things on peony axioms, on the operations in the natural numbers

22:58.640 --> 23:04.640
with which I can calculate how the logic continues, what is the consequence of the logic.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.720
So he built a practical computer out of natural numbers with which he could calculate

23:08.720 --> 23:10.720
logical expressions, which is very clever.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.720
Turing took a different path.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.720
Turing invented the Turing machine for this.

23:14.720 --> 23:20.720
The Turing machine is a tape that is infinitely long and has discrete symbols on it

23:20.720 --> 23:22.720
that can be edited with a typewriter.

23:22.720 --> 23:28.720
And the typewriter has a series of evidence with a small table with which it says,

23:28.720 --> 23:32.720
if I read this symbol, I replace it with the following symbol, change my own condition

23:32.800 --> 23:34.800
and go one field to the right or left.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
And with that he can describe any operation.

23:36.800 --> 23:42.800
And this Turing machine is closer to how our current computer works,

23:42.800 --> 23:46.800
because there is an address pointer that points to an address in the memory of the computer

23:46.800 --> 23:50.800
and in there is not a number from a certain alphabet,

23:50.800 --> 23:54.800
for example a byte, 256 different values.

23:54.800 --> 24:00.800
And I can interpret them as letters or numbers and then I can define operations

24:00.880 --> 24:06.880
with these letters and numbers that I connect in a certain way to execute any computer program.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.880
And with any computer program I can then define any logic.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.880
That means they came to it on different paths.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.880
And at the same time with Turing, who was a student of Wittgenstein,

24:16.880 --> 24:22.880
who tried to translate the natural language into such a kind of logic,

24:22.880 --> 24:28.880
there was Alonso Church, who came up with a different formalization

24:28.960 --> 24:30.960
of the lambda calculation.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.960
And the lambda calculation is simply an attempt to define calculations

24:34.960 --> 24:36.960
by searching and substituting on symbols.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.960
And the cool thing is that with this Hütchen calculation,

24:40.960 --> 24:44.960
or with the lambda calculation, or with the searching and substituting calculation,

24:44.960 --> 24:48.960
you can not only do regular expressions practically,

24:48.960 --> 24:50.960
but you can also calculate the Turing machine with it.

24:50.960 --> 24:54.960
And vice versa, you can define the Turing machine that calculates the lambda calculation.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
And you can define the Turing machine that calculates the natural numbers.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.040
That means they are all equal.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.040
And the idea that all these calculation systems can do exactly the same thing

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
is the Church-Turing thesis.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.040
So after naming Alonso Church and Alon Turing,

25:08.040 --> 25:12.040
who had different approaches to calculation and found that they both can do the same thing.

25:12.040 --> 25:16.040
So that we have a practical amount of languages that can do the same thing,

25:16.040 --> 25:18.040
that are equal in their expressive power.

25:18.040 --> 25:24.040
Yes, and Gödel was, so to speak, a pioneer of the whole in his thinking,

25:24.120 --> 25:28.120
who did this with the natural numbers.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.120
And in the end he found something similar.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.120
And he found that I can, in my language,

25:32.120 --> 25:36.120
which calculates itself by translating it into natural languages,

25:36.120 --> 25:38.120
express logical expressions.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
And these logical expressions can be self-reliant,

25:40.120 --> 25:42.120
because I can now build the language on myself.

25:42.120 --> 25:46.120
And I can unfortunately have linguistic expressions that define the truth

25:46.120 --> 25:48.120
and then say, I am wrong myself.

25:48.120 --> 25:52.120
And that is ultimately what Tarski did,

25:52.200 --> 25:56.200
he expressed expressions that were self-reliant and said, I am wrong myself.

25:56.200 --> 26:00.200
And that is not compatible with our three basic rules of logic,

26:00.200 --> 26:02.200
because now the thing is not true or false,

26:02.200 --> 26:04.200
but it is something else.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.200
It changes all the time, if you would evaluate it with a computer.

26:08.200 --> 26:12.200
And for an computer scientist this is not a big problem.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.200
The computer scientist simply says,

26:14.200 --> 26:16.200
in my programming language,

26:16.200 --> 26:20.200
you try to write the lambda calculation efficiently as computer programming language,

26:20.280 --> 26:24.280
I can define the truth with true and false.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.280
And then I have a function that calculates it for my expression.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.280
And now I calculate it and determine

26:28.280 --> 26:30.280
as long as I haven't calculated it, it has no value.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.280
And if the thing is self-reliant, it has no defined value,

26:32.280 --> 26:34.280
but it constantly changes.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.280
So no problem, I just defined it like that.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.280
If you don't like it, then define it differently.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.280
And in mathematics, is that a problem, at least in the way we understand it now?

26:42.280 --> 26:44.280
In classical mathematics, exactly.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.280
In pre-constructive mathematics.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.360
But there was a time in mathematics,

26:48.360 --> 26:50.360
before the mathematics of the way came

26:50.360 --> 26:52.360
and the computation was invented as a concept,

26:52.360 --> 26:54.360
already mathematicians like, for example, Brewer,

26:54.360 --> 26:56.360
who said,

26:56.360 --> 26:58.360
what we are doing here is not fine.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.360
It leads to contradictions that may not be cleared up.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.360
And he said,

27:04.360 --> 27:06.360
the problem I see is infinity.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.360
Maybe we shouldn't allow infinity.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
And then there was,

27:10.360 --> 27:12.360
that was called intuitionism in mathematics.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.360
And this intuitionism in mathematics

27:14.440 --> 27:16.440
did not go very far.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.440
Most mathematicians found what he said not convincing.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.440
And I think that's because

27:20.440 --> 27:22.440
he didn't express his intuition well enough.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.440
He saw something

27:24.440 --> 27:26.440
and tried to formalize it,

27:26.440 --> 27:28.440
but not so that the other mathematicians

27:28.440 --> 27:30.440
saw everything he meant.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.440
And that is in a certain way

27:32.440 --> 27:34.440
that it fell on our feet

27:34.440 --> 27:36.440
only later became visible.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.440
And where you could guess that

27:38.440 --> 27:40.440
were things like Hilbert's Hotel.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.440
Hilbert's Hotel is a hotel

27:42.520 --> 27:44.520
that has a lot of rooms.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.520
And these rooms are all fully booked.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.520
And now a new guest comes on the way.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.520
And the great thing is that this hotel

27:50.520 --> 27:52.520
can accommodate the guest

27:52.520 --> 27:54.520
because the porter simply

27:54.520 --> 27:56.520
calls all rooms

27:56.520 --> 27:58.520
and tells all guests,

27:58.520 --> 28:00.520
go all one room number to the right.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.520
And because it has an infinite number of rooms,

28:02.520 --> 28:04.520
it's not a problem.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.520
We now have one room free

28:06.520 --> 28:08.520
and can accommodate the new guest.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.520
And that's kind of very sad, isn't it?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.600
What do we do now?

28:12.600 --> 28:14.600
Then the porter says to all guests,

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
please go to the double room number of yours.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
And voila, we now have

28:18.600 --> 28:20.600
an infinite number of rooms free

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
and can accommodate an infinite number of buses

28:22.600 --> 28:24.600
with new guests.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
And the mathematicians,

28:26.600 --> 28:28.600
some of them thought it was good

28:28.600 --> 28:30.600
because it's nice when you

28:30.600 --> 28:32.600
get something out of nothing

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
and even get a lot.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.600
But other people get stomach pain from it.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.600
Doesn't lead to problems at some point.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.680
And one of the problems

28:40.680 --> 28:42.680
was seen when Kantor

28:42.680 --> 28:44.680
dealt with it.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.680
And then he found that

28:46.680 --> 28:48.680
when we define numbers in such a way

28:48.680 --> 28:50.680
that it is the cardinality,

28:50.680 --> 28:52.680
that is, the number of members of a set,

28:52.680 --> 28:54.680
that is, how many we count,

28:54.680 --> 28:56.680
we define number by number.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.680
We simply say that a number is a number

28:58.680 --> 29:00.680
of things that are in a quantity, for example.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.680
Then we can say that the number of members

29:02.680 --> 29:04.680
that has a quantity is the number.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.680
And there is an empty quantity,

29:06.760 --> 29:08.760
and that corresponds to zero.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.760
And otherwise we get all the numbers,

29:10.760 --> 29:12.760
all the positive numbers,

29:12.760 --> 29:14.760
as the number of members in there.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.760
And because of the previous backward numbers

29:16.760 --> 29:18.760
we also get negative numbers and so on

29:18.760 --> 29:20.760
and can then deduct the rest from it.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.760
And that leads to problems.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.760
If we think about it,

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760
that the amount of all subsets

29:26.760 --> 29:28.760
of a quantity

29:28.760 --> 29:30.760
can also be defined

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
and the amount of all subsets of a quantity

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
is greater than the amount of all members

29:34.840 --> 29:36.840
It is clear, right?

29:36.840 --> 29:38.840
So for the quantity of all subsets

29:38.840 --> 29:40.840
for example, if we have four members,

29:40.840 --> 29:42.840
these are all combinations

29:42.840 --> 29:44.840
that these four members can have together.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.840
And that is always more

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
than there are members.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.840
And that would mean

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
if we have an infinitely large quantity

29:52.840 --> 29:54.840
and an infinitely many members,

29:54.840 --> 29:56.840
that the quantity of all subsets

29:56.840 --> 29:58.840
must be greater than infinity.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.840
So there are different infinities.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.840
And can we do that?

30:02.920 --> 30:04.920
But what happens

30:04.920 --> 30:06.920
if we do the total quantity?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.920
The quantity of all subsets

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
also has infinitely many members

30:10.920 --> 30:12.920
and it is a very large kind of infinity

30:12.920 --> 30:14.920
because it also contains the quantity of subsets.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.920
But what about the quantity

30:16.920 --> 30:18.920
of all subsets of the total quantity?

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
It also has more members

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
than the total quantity.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.920
But the total quantity

30:24.920 --> 30:26.920
must also contain all of them.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.920
The quantity of all subsets.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.920
And that leads to the unpleasant result

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
that the quantity of all subsets

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
does not have as many members

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
as the quantity of all subsets.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
That is, it leads to contradiction

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
and this contradiction cannot be solved

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
without further explanation,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
at least not in the quantity theory

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
because it is defined this way.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And for computer scientists

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
this is not the problem

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
because they never have the problem

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
that infinitely many members are in there.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
The computer scientists would point out

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
that this does not work at all

30:59.080 --> 31:01.080
because they can only multiply with two.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.080
And that means there are always only infinitely many

31:03.080 --> 31:05.080
even if they become very large.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.080
It will never go to infinity.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.080
The only thing I can deal with

31:09.080 --> 31:11.080
is unlimited, unboundedness.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.080
And unlimited means

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
that I will never have a size

31:15.080 --> 31:17.080
but that I only look at an area

31:17.080 --> 31:19.080
where it gets bigger and bigger

31:19.080 --> 31:21.080
and where I can still add something.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.080
And I can find statements

31:23.080 --> 31:25.080
about how unlimited works.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.080
And at some point the numbers will become very large

31:27.160 --> 31:29.160
For example, I can find out

31:29.160 --> 31:31.160
that many corners

31:31.160 --> 31:35.080
that are

31:35.080 --> 31:37.080
and that have very large numbers of corners

31:37.080 --> 31:39.080
are getting closer and closer to a circle.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.080
And that is when I describe the ratio

31:41.080 --> 31:43.080
of circumference and diameter

31:43.080 --> 31:45.080
it always comes closer to a constant

31:45.080 --> 31:47.080
that I can never determine exactly

31:47.080 --> 31:49.080
but can always determine more precisely

31:49.080 --> 31:51.080
the more I add corners, so to speak.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.080
I can do that.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.080
And the computer scientists,

31:55.080 --> 31:57.080
that you mathematicians always wanted to have.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.080
You have never done more than that.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.080
And if you want to describe the world,

32:01.080 --> 32:03.080
that is exactly what you are doing.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.080
And if you claimed that you have always had

32:05.080 --> 32:07.080
infinity and continuity

32:07.080 --> 32:09.080
and you write the outside of your function on it

32:09.080 --> 32:11.080
and they unfold your functions

32:11.080 --> 32:13.080
and look what you have secretly done

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
underneath the specification,

32:15.080 --> 32:17.080
we notice that you never had infinity

32:17.080 --> 32:19.080
but you have always only cheated.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.080
In your code base of mathematics

32:21.080 --> 32:23.080
you have always only dealt with finite things

32:23.080 --> 32:25.080
and you have always developed tricks

32:25.080 --> 32:27.080
with which you could deal with something similar

32:27.080 --> 32:29.080
as infinity, but there was never infinity

32:29.080 --> 32:31.080
but always only unlimitedness.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.080
Well, and that is possibly important

32:33.080 --> 32:35.080
when we describe reality

32:35.080 --> 32:37.080
because the physicists

32:37.080 --> 32:39.080
have already checked out this code base

32:39.080 --> 32:41.080
from mathematics in the 19th century.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.080
So long before Gödel and Thuring

32:43.080 --> 32:45.080
and Wittgenstein

32:45.080 --> 32:47.080
and have infinity in there.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.080
And that is not a big problem for the mechanics

32:49.080 --> 32:51.080
because the mechanics only works in a nutritional way

32:51.080 --> 32:53.080
and it is also not a problem for thermodynamics

32:53.080 --> 32:55.080
but it is a problem for the foundation physics.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.080
So for the basics of physics.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.080
Because where the lowest level of reality

32:59.080 --> 33:01.080
is to be described,

33:01.080 --> 33:03.080
if there are continuous objects in there

33:03.080 --> 33:05.080
and the continuous objects can not even exist

33:05.080 --> 33:07.080
because no reasonable language can exist

33:07.080 --> 33:09.080
that does not fly around the ears,

33:09.080 --> 33:11.080
then it means that we have to describe

33:11.080 --> 33:13.080
the basics of physics

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
in a new way.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.080
Yes, and all because we did not

33:17.080 --> 33:19.080
listen to Brauer or Brewer.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.080
Yes, exactly.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.080
Or Pythagoras.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.080
Yes, Pythagoras.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.080
Yes, and Pythagoras did not know yet

33:27.080 --> 33:29.080
how to express it.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.080
And from the current point of view, I would say

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
that the computer scientists express it correctly

33:33.080 --> 33:35.080
by saying that it must be expressed

33:35.080 --> 33:37.080
in a formal language that is predictable.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.080
That means not only on my particular computer

33:39.080 --> 33:41.080
but at least on theoretically

33:41.080 --> 33:43.080
existing computers.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.080
So on systems that

33:45.080 --> 33:47.080
go from state to state in any way.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.080
Music

34:19.080 --> 34:21.080
Music

34:21.080 --> 34:23.080
Music

34:23.080 --> 34:25.080
Music

34:25.080 --> 34:27.080
Music

34:27.080 --> 34:29.080
Music

34:29.080 --> 34:31.080
So level 3 meant

34:31.080 --> 34:33.080
that the formal language

34:33.080 --> 34:35.080
in which we define the truth must be consistent.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.080
And with Gödel we have now noticed

34:37.080 --> 34:39.080
that at least the classical mathematics

34:39.080 --> 34:41.080
does not have this consistency

34:41.080 --> 34:43.080
because we have statements that are self-contradictory.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.080
Consistency means we have no contradictions,

34:45.080 --> 34:47.080
we obviously have contradictions.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.080
We have a system where we eventually come out

34:49.080 --> 34:51.080
with computation

34:51.080 --> 34:53.080
or with state transitions

34:53.080 --> 34:55.080
within our formal language.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.080
Exactly.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.080
Franz, take level 4.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.080
Because we are currently

35:01.080 --> 35:03.080
moving from level 4 to level 5.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.080
We are now at level 4.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.080
We are now at level 4.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.080
We are now at level 4.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.080
This follows.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.080
Gödel's theory proves

35:13.080 --> 35:15.080
that logic is undecidable

35:15.080 --> 35:17.080
and truth cannot generally be determined

35:17.080 --> 35:19.080
by a mathematical procedure.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.080
We have to build something else

35:47.080 --> 35:49.080
that actually works.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.080
And the thing is that this Gödel's

35:51.080 --> 35:53.080
theory,

35:53.080 --> 35:55.080
his two non-completeness statements,

35:55.080 --> 35:57.080
the philosophers

35:57.080 --> 35:59.080
in my opinion

35:59.080 --> 36:01.080
did not really change the fabric.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.080
And what the philosophers

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
find out when you look at

36:05.080 --> 36:07.080
the literature and the discussion in philosophy

36:07.080 --> 36:09.080
is, on the whole,

36:09.080 --> 36:11.080
the mathematicians have proven

36:11.080 --> 36:13.080
that mathematics is impotent to describe reality.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.080
Or even the ultimate relativism proof.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.080
We can't find any statements

36:17.080 --> 36:19.080
because everything is contradictory.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.080
That would only be true if the philosophers

36:21.080 --> 36:23.080
went home, which they don't do.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.080
But what the philosophers find out is

36:25.080 --> 36:27.080
that the mathematicians cannot describe the world.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.080
And that gives people

36:29.080 --> 36:31.080
who don't understand mathematics

36:31.080 --> 36:33.080
an advantage,

36:33.080 --> 36:35.080
namely the philosophers.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.080
That means that the philosophers have

36:37.080 --> 36:39.080
possibly techniques that are not accessible

36:39.080 --> 36:41.080
to the mathematicians with their formal languages

36:41.080 --> 36:43.080
and that the mathematicians can use

36:43.080 --> 36:45.080
to capture reality.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.080
And that is a very interesting question.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.080
It leads to the assumption

36:49.080 --> 36:51.080
that someone like Roger Penrose,

36:51.080 --> 36:53.080
similar to the philosopher Lukas

36:53.080 --> 36:55.080
in front of him,

36:55.080 --> 36:57.080
that our mind is able

36:57.080 --> 36:59.080
to perform operations

36:59.080 --> 37:01.080
that go beyond what computers can do.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.080
So for example to discover evidence

37:03.080 --> 37:05.080
and to lead evidence

37:05.080 --> 37:07.080
that computers cannot lead.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.080
But the thing is that the evidence itself,

37:09.080 --> 37:11.080
is a step-by-step

37:13.080 --> 37:15.080
conversion of a statement

37:15.080 --> 37:17.080
into axioms.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.080
That is an algorithm,

37:19.080 --> 37:21.080
that is what Greg Chaitin says.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.080
And of course there are a few evidences

37:23.080 --> 37:25.080
that work a little differently,

37:25.080 --> 37:27.080
but these evidences can be derived from such evidences.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.080
What do you say about the

37:29.080 --> 37:31.080
example of ZFC or ZF,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.080
that at least

37:33.080 --> 37:35.080
Russell's paradox

37:35.080 --> 37:37.080
emerges and I think

37:37.080 --> 37:39.080
you can also avoid

37:39.080 --> 37:41.080
the paradoxes

37:41.080 --> 37:43.080
that you just mentioned

37:43.080 --> 37:45.080
with the amounts of potential

37:45.080 --> 37:47.080
and the cardinalities.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.080
But you also can't get

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
out of ZF, as far as I know.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
And that means

37:53.080 --> 37:55.080
that ZF is also

37:55.080 --> 37:57.080
condemned to failure from the perspective.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.080
They are all formal systems

37:59.080 --> 38:01.080
that work under certain conditions

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
and do not work under other conditions.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.080
And that means that

38:05.080 --> 38:07.080
in order to bring the whole world into it,

38:07.080 --> 38:09.080
only certain parts fit in.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.080
And when I try to define

38:11.080 --> 38:13.080
numbers myself,

38:13.080 --> 38:15.080
and I am not a mathematician

38:15.080 --> 38:17.080
or a philosopher of mathematics,

38:17.080 --> 38:19.080
then it is quite informal. From my point of view,

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
the best way to define numbers

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
is a subsequent labeling scheme.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.080
So it is a procedure

38:25.080 --> 38:27.080
that allows me to

38:27.080 --> 38:29.080
give places a new label,

38:29.080 --> 38:31.080
in such a way that they are ordered.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.080
And that gives me everything

38:33.080 --> 38:35.080
that I want. It is simply an algorithm

38:35.080 --> 38:37.080
with which I can represent

38:37.080 --> 38:39.080
locations,

38:39.080 --> 38:41.080
I can assign

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
a symbol to them.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.080
And the way we

38:45.080 --> 38:47.080
represent numbers in the simplest way

38:47.080 --> 38:49.080
is that we say

38:49.080 --> 38:51.080
zero, we don't need anything,

38:51.080 --> 38:53.080
one we knock once, two we knock twice,

38:53.080 --> 38:55.080
three we knock three times, four we knock

38:55.080 --> 38:57.080
four times, and so on. And that

38:57.080 --> 38:59.080
becomes very boring and long-winded

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
very quickly. And that's why

39:01.080 --> 39:03.080
when we as humans

39:03.080 --> 39:05.080
talk about numbers,

39:05.080 --> 39:07.080
we try to compress them mentally.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.080
And the compression algorithm

39:09.080 --> 39:11.080
that we normally use for numbers

39:11.080 --> 39:13.080
is, in our cultural circle,

39:13.080 --> 39:15.080
that we form a tenor logarithm.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.080
That means that we represent the size

39:17.080 --> 39:19.080
of numbers. And that means

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
that we have tenors, one,

39:21.080 --> 39:23.080
hundreds, thousands, and so on, and so on.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.080
But we could also do it with other powers.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.080
And the practical thing is

39:27.080 --> 39:29.080
that we now have numbers,

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
we write numbers, describe them,

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
these regularities of numbers

39:33.080 --> 39:35.080
in a small area, and we learn

39:35.080 --> 39:37.080
a hash function. That's a function

39:37.080 --> 39:39.080
that just represents a mapping,

39:39.080 --> 39:41.080
an image from one number

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
to another, to make additions

39:43.080 --> 39:45.080
in our head more efficient.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
That means that we learn that

39:47.080 --> 39:49.080
if we put two and three together, we get five.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.080
And we learn that by heart.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.080
And if we don't know how to do that,

39:53.080 --> 39:55.080
we just count on our fingers. So we go back

39:55.080 --> 39:57.080
to the knock once, twice, three times.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.080
And by doing that, we can remember how

39:59.080 --> 40:01.080
this hash function worked. And also

40:01.080 --> 40:03.080
we have to learn how to transfer.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.080
That means how to get from one number to the other.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.080
That means we learn in simple algorithms

40:07.080 --> 40:09.080
with which we can transfer in numbers

40:09.080 --> 40:11.080
that we write cleverly and efficiently.

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
The tenor system is not optimal.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.080
From my point of view,

40:15.080 --> 40:17.080
we should have taken hexadecimal,

40:17.080 --> 40:19.080
the sixteenth system.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.080
Because the nice thing about a sixteenth system

40:21.080 --> 40:23.080
is that it's a two-year potential.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.080
So that you can

40:25.080 --> 40:27.080
multiply and divide.

40:27.080 --> 40:29.080
Another system that is very nice

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
is the twelfth system.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.080
What is totally cool about the twelfth system

40:33.080 --> 40:35.080
is that it has so many parts. That means

40:35.080 --> 40:37.080
you can describe circles very well with it.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
And that's why we still use the twelfth system

40:39.080 --> 40:41.080
to describe the clock and the angle.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.080
You can also describe everything else

40:43.080 --> 40:45.080
well with the twelfth system.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.080
The tenor system is kind of stupid.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.080
That's just because someone says,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.080
I have ten fingers, let's take the tenor system.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.080
It's totally suboptimal.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.080
It's almost as good as the tenor system.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.080
But you can do something much better

40:57.080 --> 40:59.080
with twelfth potential.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.080
There is of course another point.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.080
The twelfth system is so cool

41:03.080 --> 41:05.080
because you can work so well

41:05.080 --> 41:07.080
with binary logic,

41:07.080 --> 41:09.080
with true force 1.0,

41:09.080 --> 41:11.080
with one polarity.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.080
And this one polarity,

41:13.080 --> 41:15.080
this one noticeable difference

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
to get back to our starting point

41:17.080 --> 41:19.080
is so great as the minimum

41:19.080 --> 41:21.080
from which you can build everything.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.080
It's optimal.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.080
Maybe you shouldn't use a fourth system

41:25.080 --> 41:27.080
or a fifth system as optimal and so on.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.080
And apparently the optimal

41:29.080 --> 41:31.080
is the third system,

41:31.080 --> 41:33.080
the tenor logic.

41:33.080 --> 41:35.080
Why is it optimal?

41:35.080 --> 41:37.080
That was explained to me

41:37.080 --> 41:39.080
by the physicist Ed Fredkin.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.080
And it has something to do with

41:41.080 --> 41:43.080
when I imagine

41:43.080 --> 41:45.080
I'm building a memory chip

41:45.080 --> 41:47.080
or a CPU,

41:47.080 --> 41:49.080
so electronics,

41:49.080 --> 41:51.080
and I try to build up the logic optimally,

41:51.080 --> 41:53.080
then the question is

41:53.080 --> 41:55.080
how does the size of my circuit behave,

41:55.080 --> 41:57.080
how many more circuits do I need

41:57.080 --> 41:59.080
if I want to form more possible states.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.080
And this surface growth

42:03.080 --> 42:05.080
that I need if I want to form more information

42:05.080 --> 42:07.080
has something to do with

42:07.080 --> 42:09.080
how many more digits I need.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.080
For example, in the twelfth system

42:11.080 --> 42:13.080
I can form 256 different values

42:13.080 --> 42:15.080
with 8 digits,

42:15.080 --> 42:17.080
with one byte.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.080
So a three-digit decimal number

42:19.080 --> 42:21.080
or a two-digit hexadecimal number.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.080
The hexadecimal would be the FF

42:23.080 --> 42:25.080
of the 16 digits.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.080
That's what you traditionally

42:27.080 --> 42:29.080
call ABCDEF

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
for the digits

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
from 10 to 16.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.080
And in the tenor system

42:35.080 --> 42:37.080
you would take

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
for example 0 and minus 1 and 1

42:39.080 --> 42:41.080
or 0, 1 and 2

42:41.080 --> 42:43.080
and build up all the numbers from them.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.080
And the cool thing is

42:45.080 --> 42:47.080
that it's more about the optimal growth rate.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
And the optimal growth rate

42:49.080 --> 42:51.080
is the number E.

42:51.080 --> 42:53.080
And E is

42:53.080 --> 42:55.080
2.81,

42:55.080 --> 42:57.080
it goes on, I don't know exactly,

42:57.080 --> 42:59.080
embarrassingly.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.080
And 3 is the number

43:01.080 --> 43:03.080
that's next to it.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.080
And Fredkin

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
was a very wild physicist

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
who had totally crazy ideas.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.080
But this idea

43:11.080 --> 43:13.080
was checked.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.080
There was a Russian

43:15.080 --> 43:17.080
who built a computer in the Soviet Union

43:17.080 --> 43:19.080
who built terrestrial logic

43:19.080 --> 43:21.080
and they could show that they are more energy efficient

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
and have less optimal

43:23.080 --> 43:25.080
circuits than the binary system.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
But since the world started

43:27.080 --> 43:29.080
with the binary system and already

43:29.080 --> 43:31.080
adjusted to it and so much theory and practice

43:31.080 --> 43:33.080
existed, we stayed with it.

43:33.080 --> 43:35.080
I just understand father-dependency

43:35.080 --> 43:37.080
like the tessitura layout and things like that.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
Exactly.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.080
We have to redesign at some point.

43:41.080 --> 43:43.080
But it's also not bad, because in the end

43:43.080 --> 43:45.080
it's equivalent.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.080
And the fourth shows that

43:47.080 --> 43:49.080
we haven't been able to use

43:49.080 --> 43:51.080
this original mathematical logic

43:51.080 --> 43:53.080
since Ergödel.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.080
By the way, the Russellian Antinomy

43:55.080 --> 43:57.080
maybe we can explain it for the listeners.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.080
Do you want to?

43:59.080 --> 44:01.080
The Russellian Antinomy

44:01.080 --> 44:03.080
is either used as

44:03.080 --> 44:05.080
Barbara's paradox, right?

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
There's the

44:07.080 --> 44:09.080
razor, no, what's his name?

44:09.080 --> 44:11.080
The hairdresser.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.080
The one who razes everyone in his village

44:13.080 --> 44:15.080
except the ones who

44:15.080 --> 44:17.080
shave themselves.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.080
The ones who don't...

44:19.080 --> 44:21.080
We didn't catch that well.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.080
The ones who don't shave themselves.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
Exactly.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.080
And then of course the question is

44:27.080 --> 44:29.080
does he shave himself?

44:29.080 --> 44:31.080
That's a contradiction.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.080
Let's go through it so that we can listen

44:33.080 --> 44:35.080
and not think about it.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.080
Yes.

44:37.080 --> 44:39.080
Do you want to do it or what?

44:39.080 --> 44:41.080
Just go close to the microphone.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.080
You don't have to...

44:43.080 --> 44:45.080
So that you can think about it again.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.080
If the razor razes everyone who doesn't shave

44:47.080 --> 44:49.080
himself, it's of course the question who

44:49.080 --> 44:51.080
razes the razor.

44:51.080 --> 44:53.080
And if he doesn't shave himself,

44:53.080 --> 44:55.080
then it means he's one of the instances

44:55.080 --> 44:57.080
that are shaved, because he razes

44:57.080 --> 44:59.080
everyone who doesn't shave himself.

44:59.080 --> 45:01.080
And that means he razes himself, but as soon as

45:01.080 --> 45:03.080
he razes himself, he doesn't shave himself.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.080
It's always stupid when you express it in

45:05.080 --> 45:07.080
words.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.080
Of course, it's a theoretical amount.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.080
The amount of all the amounts that don't

45:11.080 --> 45:13.080
shave themselves.

45:13.080 --> 45:15.080
If they shave themselves, then they

45:15.080 --> 45:17.080
shouldn't shave themselves.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
If they don't shave themselves, then they

45:19.080 --> 45:21.080
have to shave themselves, because they

45:21.080 --> 45:23.080
have all the amounts that don't shave

45:23.080 --> 45:25.080
themselves.

45:25.080 --> 45:27.080
Maybe we'll show you some graphs.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.080
But why is that even a problem?

45:29.080 --> 45:31.080
It's a problem because the

45:31.080 --> 45:33.080
way that shaving is done in this

45:33.080 --> 45:35.080
place, and with the language they express

45:35.080 --> 45:37.080
an expression that is valid.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.080
It considers all rules of this

45:39.080 --> 45:41.080
language, and yet it leads

45:41.080 --> 45:43.080
this sentence into contradictions.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.080
It simply leads to the fact that you can't

45:45.080 --> 45:47.080
make a valid statement about the

45:47.080 --> 45:49.080
hairdresser himself and find out if

45:49.080 --> 45:51.080
he's shaving himself or not.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.080
It's not a problem for the computer scientists.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.080
The computer scientists are familiar with the fact

45:55.080 --> 45:57.080
that you can make specifications for

45:57.080 --> 45:59.080
which there is no implementation.

45:59.080 --> 46:01.080
That means that the thing doesn't even exist.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.080
The customer wants it,

46:03.080 --> 46:05.080
he says,

46:05.080 --> 46:07.080
I want this and that,

46:07.080 --> 46:09.080
and you as a computer scientist look at it

46:09.080 --> 46:11.080
and say, I'm sorry, it doesn't work, I can

46:11.080 --> 46:13.080
prove that it doesn't work.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.080
And for the computer scientists it's not a problem at all,

46:15.080 --> 46:17.080
they're used to the fact that the world works that way.

46:17.080 --> 46:19.080
That the language, if you use it

46:19.080 --> 46:21.080
inappropriately, leads to

46:21.080 --> 46:23.080
things that are said in the language

46:23.080 --> 46:25.080
that have nothing to do with the world.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.080
And the only languages that can say

46:27.080 --> 46:29.080
that always agree with the world

46:29.080 --> 46:31.080
are the languages in which

46:31.080 --> 46:33.080
the implementation itself takes place.

46:33.080 --> 46:35.080
That is, there is a difference between

46:35.080 --> 46:37.080
syntax and semantics, classically.

46:37.080 --> 46:39.080
Semantics is the meaning

46:39.080 --> 46:41.080
that the language has, and the syntax

46:41.080 --> 46:43.080
are the rules by which the language

46:43.080 --> 46:45.080
is calculated, that is, in which

46:45.080 --> 46:47.080
the language is written and evaluated.

46:47.080 --> 46:49.080
And originally

46:49.080 --> 46:51.080
people in mathematics

46:51.080 --> 46:53.080
assumed that

46:53.080 --> 46:55.080
the syntax and the semantics

46:55.080 --> 46:57.080
are related to each other, and that

46:57.080 --> 46:59.080
they can be depicted on top of each other,

46:59.080 --> 47:01.080
but that they are fundamentally different.

47:01.080 --> 47:03.080
And in computer science

47:03.080 --> 47:05.080
the semantics of a language is the

47:05.080 --> 47:07.080
causal structure that the language has,

47:07.080 --> 47:09.080
so what the computer program does at the end.

47:09.080 --> 47:11.080
And the computer program always does

47:11.080 --> 47:13.080
something, and maybe it doesn't do

47:13.080 --> 47:15.080
what you want, but that's not the problem

47:15.080 --> 47:17.080
of this language, that's your problem,

47:17.080 --> 47:19.080
that you use the language in a way

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
that doesn't mean what the language actually means.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.080
And from my point of view

47:23.080 --> 47:25.080
you can interpret existence

47:25.080 --> 47:27.080
in such a way that you say

47:27.080 --> 47:29.080
to exist means to be implemented.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.080
To be implemented means

47:31.080 --> 47:33.080
that there is a system somewhere

47:33.080 --> 47:35.080
that works in such a way

47:35.080 --> 47:37.080
that what is described there happens.

47:37.080 --> 47:39.080
And that is exactly that.

47:39.080 --> 47:41.080
This is a very general term

47:41.080 --> 47:43.080
of implementation. You could, for example, say

47:43.080 --> 47:45.080
is there really money, or is it just

47:45.080 --> 47:47.080
a way of talking about things?

47:47.080 --> 47:49.080
And you could say, is there really money

47:49.080 --> 47:51.080
in the way that money is implemented?

47:51.080 --> 47:53.080
So there are symbol systems

47:53.080 --> 47:55.080
in the world, and there are agreements

47:55.080 --> 47:57.080
and meanings, there are causal structures

47:57.080 --> 47:59.080
that lead to money being there.

47:59.080 --> 48:01.080
And that exists from certain points of view,

48:01.080 --> 48:03.080
and it doesn't exist from other points of view.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.080
It depends on the language that I use

48:05.080 --> 48:07.080
and the causal structures

48:07.080 --> 48:09.080
that exist from the point of view

48:09.080 --> 48:11.080
of this language. And there are certain

48:11.080 --> 48:13.080
moments when the money doesn't exist,

48:13.080 --> 48:15.080
where, for example,

48:15.080 --> 48:17.080
a central bank looks at the thing

48:17.080 --> 48:19.080
and says, it doesn't work anymore, we have to

48:19.080 --> 48:21.080
change the currency.

48:21.080 --> 48:23.080
And at that moment the money stops

48:23.080 --> 48:25.080
to exist for a moment, and

48:25.080 --> 48:27.080
then the money is reinvented,

48:27.080 --> 48:29.080
so to speak, as a kind of software.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.080
And compared to our

48:31.080 --> 48:33.080
poor hairdresser,

48:33.080 --> 48:35.080
the whole thing looks like

48:35.080 --> 48:37.080
that the mathematician has taken the

48:37.080 --> 48:39.080
liberty of using a language

48:39.080 --> 48:41.080
that doesn't describe anything

48:41.080 --> 48:43.080
in the borderline.

48:43.080 --> 48:45.080
Or he has the claim

48:45.080 --> 48:47.080
that it describes something, and

48:47.080 --> 48:49.080
doesn't do anything about it.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.080
Because there obviously can't be this hairdresser.

48:51.080 --> 48:53.080
What the mathematician has done now,

48:53.080 --> 48:55.080
he has just invented a rule

48:55.080 --> 48:57.080
for a kind of game,

48:57.080 --> 48:59.080
and this rule is not solvable, not solvable.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.080
There can't be a game that works like that.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.080
And we can prove that it doesn't work like that.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.080
And that means, don't expect it to work like that.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.080
We can't build a computer program

49:07.080 --> 49:09.080
that works like that.

49:11.080 --> 49:13.080
Very briefly, sorry.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.080
So there is no hairdresser

49:15.080 --> 49:17.080
who doesn't shave themselves.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.080
Yes, there simply can't be one.

49:19.080 --> 49:21.080
There can't be one, and you can't even

49:21.080 --> 49:23.080
really imagine it, by the way.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.080
That's also a bit counterintuitive.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.080
You think, oh, there you imagine something

49:27.080 --> 49:29.080
that you can't implement, but even the

49:29.080 --> 49:31.080
imagination doesn't work. Even that breaks

49:31.080 --> 49:33.080
in when you switch back and forth,

49:33.080 --> 49:35.080
and you can't stabilize it.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.080
That's also important.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.080
If we now move on

49:39.080 --> 49:41.080
to the next stage,

49:41.080 --> 49:43.080
which says

49:43.080 --> 49:45.080
that all consistent notions

49:45.080 --> 49:47.080
of truth are computational,

49:47.080 --> 49:49.080
and the Church-Turing thesis says that

49:49.080 --> 49:51.080
all computational languages are equivalent.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.080
So what that means is

49:53.080 --> 49:55.080
that after Gürtel's theorem has proven

49:55.080 --> 49:57.080
to us that logic is

49:57.080 --> 49:59.080
indecisive and that truth

49:59.080 --> 50:01.080
cannot be defined in general by a mathematical

50:01.080 --> 50:03.080
procedure, it means that

50:03.080 --> 50:05.080
we have simply misdefined truth.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.080
If truth is defined in such a way

50:07.080 --> 50:09.080
that it doesn't have to

50:09.080 --> 50:11.080
rely on hairdressers who don't shave themselves,

50:11.080 --> 50:13.080
then the truth has simply been misdefined.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.080
That means we need

50:15.080 --> 50:17.080
a different theory of truth.

50:17.080 --> 50:19.080
We need a theory of truth that

50:19.080 --> 50:21.080
can be described in such a way

50:21.080 --> 50:23.080
that you can always determine what is true.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.080
That means the truth depends on the

50:25.080 --> 50:27.080
procedure with which you determine it.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.080
And that means, if you claim that

50:29.080 --> 50:31.080
something is true, you have to indicate

50:31.080 --> 50:33.080
with which procedure you come to the truth.

50:33.080 --> 50:35.080
And if this procedure doesn't exist

50:35.080 --> 50:37.080
or you can't indicate it,

50:37.080 --> 50:39.080
then you don't have a theory of truth.

50:39.080 --> 50:41.080
How long did it take you to come to the truth?

50:41.080 --> 50:43.080
That's the question.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.080
Are you able to build a system

50:45.080 --> 50:47.080
that takes endless steps?

50:47.080 --> 50:49.080
It's not just a practical question,

50:49.080 --> 50:51.080
but also a theoretical question.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.080
Is there a hypothetical universe

50:53.080 --> 50:55.080
in which mathematics exists

50:55.080 --> 50:57.080
where you can do that? And it doesn't work.

50:57.080 --> 50:59.080
You get the bounding,

50:59.080 --> 51:01.080
but what you don't get is

51:01.080 --> 51:03.080
the infinity.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.080
You only get the infinity

51:05.080 --> 51:07.080
if you assume it's already there.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.080
It's like a little black box

51:09.080 --> 51:11.080
from which the infinity comes out.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.080
But when you open the box,

51:13.080 --> 51:15.080
you don't see anything in there that makes sense.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.080
In ZF, for example, there's the infinity axiom.

51:17.080 --> 51:19.080
It's introduced by axiom.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.080
Exactly. That's the box you take

51:21.080 --> 51:23.080
and you look at a real universe

51:23.080 --> 51:25.080
as an observer.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
Real doesn't necessarily mean physical,

51:27.080 --> 51:29.080
but some hypothetical.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.080
For example, in a computer language,

51:31.080 --> 51:33.080
I build a hypothetical computer.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.080
What would it look like

51:35.080 --> 51:37.080
if I implemented it?

51:37.080 --> 51:39.080
What would the subroutine look like?

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
That's not possible.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.080
We're still at level 4-5.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.080
We're going over to level 5.

52:09.080 --> 52:11.080
We refer to the mathematical logic

52:11.080 --> 52:13.080
that Götel believed in.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.080
And we say to Götel

52:15.080 --> 52:17.080
that the vibration doesn't come from

52:17.080 --> 52:19.080
the fact that you realized

52:19.080 --> 52:21.080
that mathematics doesn't work,

52:21.080 --> 52:23.080
but that you used the wrong mathematics.

52:23.080 --> 52:25.080
There's a mathematics that works,

52:25.080 --> 52:27.080
and that mathematics is

52:27.080 --> 52:29.080
the constructive mathematics.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.080
The modern name for constructive mathematics

52:31.080 --> 52:33.080
is computation.

52:33.080 --> 52:35.080
We've already talked about infinity.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.080
It's about the fact that

52:37.080 --> 52:39.080
you can't observe infinity.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.080
Every observation is necessarily

52:41.080 --> 52:43.080
a discrete, finite bit vector.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.080
You can't observe infinitely

52:45.080 --> 52:47.080
and then close it off.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.080
It doesn't work.

52:49.080 --> 52:51.080
Empirically, you can't get it in.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.080
You can't construct it.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.080
You can't start to formulate

52:55.080 --> 52:57.080
or build something and get it done.

52:57.080 --> 52:59.080
If it's infinite,

52:59.080 --> 53:01.080
it can't be finished by definition.

53:01.080 --> 53:03.080
If it's infinite, then you get

53:03.080 --> 53:05.080
contradictions like the razor paradox

53:05.080 --> 53:07.080
that we just talked about

53:07.080 --> 53:09.080
and like the problem of holding.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.080
I wanted to talk about holding.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.080
The question is, why is holding

53:13.080 --> 53:15.080
a problem at all?

53:15.080 --> 53:17.080
What Thuring tried to do

53:17.080 --> 53:19.080
was to train

53:19.080 --> 53:21.080
classical mathematics

53:21.080 --> 53:23.080
into computer programs.

53:23.080 --> 53:25.080
But that also means

53:25.080 --> 53:27.080
that I have computer programs

53:27.080 --> 53:29.080
that may have to run infinitely long.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.080
Where I can't determine

53:31.080 --> 53:33.080
the number of steps.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.080
The holding problem says

53:35.080 --> 53:37.080
that there is no algorithm

53:37.080 --> 53:39.080
that can determine for any

53:39.080 --> 53:41.080
unknown algorithm

53:41.080 --> 53:43.080
if it ever comes to an end.

53:43.080 --> 53:45.080
Whether you stop after an infinite number of steps

53:45.080 --> 53:47.080
or stay in an infinite loop.

53:47.080 --> 53:49.080
You can prove

53:49.080 --> 53:51.080
that the holding problem

53:51.080 --> 53:53.080
is due to

53:53.080 --> 53:55.080
reductio ad absurdum,

53:55.080 --> 53:57.080
through negation

53:57.080 --> 53:59.080
of the holding problem.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.080
If you assume

54:01.080 --> 54:03.080
that there is a computer

54:03.080 --> 54:05.080
that solves the holding problem,

54:05.080 --> 54:07.080
then you could build

54:07.080 --> 54:09.080
a loop

54:09.080 --> 54:11.080
that determines

54:11.080 --> 54:13.080
that the algorithm is terminated.

54:13.080 --> 54:15.080
Then the thing runs into an infinite loop.

54:15.080 --> 54:17.080
If I build the thing

54:17.080 --> 54:19.080
on the next step,

54:19.080 --> 54:21.080
to solve the holding problem,

54:21.080 --> 54:23.080
then the assumption that

54:23.080 --> 54:25.080
I can solve the holding problem leads

54:25.080 --> 54:27.080
to the fact that I can never build a computer

54:27.080 --> 54:29.080
that solves the holding problem

54:29.080 --> 54:31.080
for mathematical abstract reasons.

54:31.080 --> 54:33.080
In reality,

54:33.080 --> 54:35.080
the holding problem

54:35.080 --> 54:37.080
does not apply to computer science.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.080
The thing is that

54:39.080 --> 54:41.080
normally my program

54:41.080 --> 54:43.080
should come to an end

54:43.080 --> 54:45.080
after an infinite number of steps.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.080
I know how many there are.

54:47.080 --> 54:49.080
It should be finished today.

54:49.080 --> 54:51.080
Or it should be finished before I die.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.080
That means I can just let the computer run

54:53.080 --> 54:55.080
until it has a result.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.080
If it doesn't, I just stop.

54:57.080 --> 54:59.080
In our own consciousness,

54:59.080 --> 55:01.080
we can only perform

55:01.080 --> 55:03.080
so many operations in our cells

55:03.080 --> 55:05.080
and neurons.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.080
If we don't have a result

55:07.080 --> 55:09.080
after a certain time,

55:09.080 --> 55:11.080
we can't remember what happened before

55:11.080 --> 55:13.080
because we didn't live at that time

55:13.080 --> 55:15.080
or were already dead

55:15.080 --> 55:17.080
or asleep.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.080
We always have to assume

55:19.080 --> 55:21.080
that we can only perform

55:21.080 --> 55:23.080
until we have the result.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.080
The results of the holding problem

55:25.080 --> 55:27.080
are of theoretical interest,

55:27.080 --> 55:29.080
not practical.

55:29.080 --> 55:31.080
The theoretical interest

55:31.080 --> 55:33.080
has to do with the basics of logic

55:33.080 --> 55:35.080
or the basics of mathematics

55:35.080 --> 55:37.080
when I try to translate them into computer science.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.080
The holding problem is that

55:39.080 --> 55:41.080
there are classes of functions

55:41.080 --> 55:43.080
that are allowed in mathematics,

55:43.080 --> 55:45.080
but that are not determinable in computer science.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.080
I can't build a machine

55:47.080 --> 55:49.080
or a theory that is able

55:49.080 --> 55:51.080
to calculate these functions.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.080
The problem is that

55:53.080 --> 55:55.080
before the computer was invented

55:55.080 --> 55:57.080
or this concept was invented,

55:57.080 --> 55:59.080
people thought that

55:59.080 --> 56:01.080
the evaluation of logical expressions

56:01.080 --> 56:03.080
or the mathematics and interpretation

56:03.080 --> 56:05.080
of language worked.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.080
They thought that they could do more

56:07.080 --> 56:09.080
than what any interpretation system could do.

56:19.080 --> 56:21.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:21.080 --> 56:23.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:31.080 --> 56:33.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:37.080 --> 56:39.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:39.080 --> 56:41.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:43.080 --> 56:45.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:52.080 --> 56:54.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

56:58.080 --> 57:00.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

57:00.080 --> 57:02.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.080
Let's go back to the beginning.

57:06.080 --> 57:11.080
I went to the Berlin School of Mind and Brain

57:11.080 --> 57:13.080
for some time.

57:13.080 --> 57:15.080
I worked on 손역은 because I was

57:15.080 --> 57:20.080
that didn't fit into the project that took place at the time.

57:20.080 --> 57:25.080
But at the same time, I found out that I was allowed to learn

57:25.080 --> 57:30.080
and organized a seminar on the philosophy of computationalism,

57:30.080 --> 57:34.080
the basics of representation in computationalism.

57:34.080 --> 57:38.080
Among other things, I went through the lambda calculus with the students,

57:38.080 --> 57:42.080
step by step, how it works. It's not that difficult to understand.

57:42.080 --> 57:45.080
The Turing machine, step by step, is also not that difficult to understand,

57:45.080 --> 57:48.080
except for the lowest basics and why they are equivalent.

57:48.080 --> 57:52.080
After that, I asked the students what they think is more powerful.

57:52.080 --> 57:56.080
A majority of the students in the vote said that the lambda calculus is more powerful

57:56.080 --> 58:00.080
because it can make things parallel and the Turing machine only sequentially.

58:00.080 --> 58:03.080
The thing is, however, that time doesn't matter at all,

58:03.080 --> 58:05.080
but I can represent them one by one.

58:05.080 --> 58:09.080
And there are no statements about how fast it runs in the world.

58:09.080 --> 58:12.080
In fact, they are exactly the same because I can represent them

58:12.080 --> 58:15.080
one by one with a very simple procedure.

58:15.080 --> 58:20.080
And this realization that all computational systems can do the same,

58:20.080 --> 58:22.080
that's the Church-Turing thesis.

58:22.080 --> 58:26.080
But that means that I can use any of these systems

58:26.080 --> 58:29.080
to describe the entire reality.

58:29.080 --> 58:35.080
That means I can just take a Turing machine and put it into nothing,

58:35.080 --> 58:38.080
and then the whole universe runs on it.

58:38.080 --> 58:41.080
And that brings us to the next point.

58:41.080 --> 58:47.080
That means, every consistently described universe is equivalent

58:47.080 --> 58:50.080
to some kind of Turing machine,

58:50.080 --> 58:54.080
which is actually a finite but possibly unbounded automaton,

58:54.080 --> 58:59.080
but we can never know what has put a Turing machine into the void.

58:59.080 --> 59:03.080
Maybe we should briefly talk about the term automaton.

59:03.080 --> 59:07.080
The automaton is a kind of calculation to be defined

59:07.080 --> 59:09.080
by discrete state transitions.

59:09.080 --> 59:12.080
And the cellular automaton is very well known.

59:12.080 --> 59:17.080
The cellular automaton is a thing that uses cells next to each other.

59:17.080 --> 59:20.080
They can be, for example, in 1D or 2D.

59:20.080 --> 59:24.080
And then there is a rule that says that the configuration

59:24.080 --> 59:29.080
of the states of the cells goes into the next configurations.

59:30.080 --> 59:34.080
A well-known automaton is, for example, the Game of Life.

59:34.080 --> 59:38.080
It is a very nice automaton that was discovered by John Conway,

59:38.080 --> 59:40.080
and it is two-dimensional.

59:40.080 --> 59:43.080
And that means that it is just a little box thing

59:43.080 --> 59:46.080
where each cell, like on a little box of paper,

59:46.080 --> 59:48.080
has eight neighbors around it.

59:48.080 --> 59:52.080
So three times three is exactly the eight neighbors of the middle cell.

59:52.080 --> 59:55.080
And each cell can have exactly one of two states,

59:55.080 --> 59:58.080
namely living or dead, that is, filled or empty.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:05.080
We can say in the Game of Life that if a cell has more than three neighbors,

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.080
then it dies of infection.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:14.080
And if there are two or three, then you stay alive.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.080
Because if there are exactly three, you come to life.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.080
If there are less than two, more than three, you die.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.080
Exactly, so actually only two rules and the other implicit is already in there.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.080
And these rules lead to the fact that if you have a random configuration of cells

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.080
that they start blubbering and that after a certain time patterns are created there.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.080
And these patterns are always periodic at the end.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.080
And in the boring case, the period is one or zero.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.080
And that means that nothing is there anymore.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.080
But the patterns can also have relatively complex periods.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.080
So very long, complicated patterns are created.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.080
And sometimes it takes a long time for them to go over to such a periodic pattern.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.080
And you can build very interesting structures in this world of the Game of Life,

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.080
for example the so-called gliders.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.080
The glider is a kind of particle that plants itself.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.080
That is, it is a pattern that changes its surroundings in such a way

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.080
that new cells come to life on its edge and die on the opposite edge of the cell.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.080
And this is how this glider walks through the world one by one.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.080
And the gliders that you see there, they are called gliders.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.080
And the gliders that you have discovered, they move horizontally or vertically.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.080
And from the gliders you can build structures that exchange information.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:36.080
For example, computers, where the glider is a kind of bit that flies through the area

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.080
and then triggers a circuit that generates new gliders,

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.080
a glider cannon that periodically shoots new gliders.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.080
And if you aim the glider cannon correctly, then you can shoot broken glider cannons

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.080
or shoot again functionally and can practically build transistor logic with it

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:58.080
and then build a new Game of Life on the next level, for example.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.080
If you zoom out, it looks like the Game of Life and re-images itself.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.080
The Game of Life is Turing complete.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.080
And there was a competition between Steven Wolfram and Marvin Minsky

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.080
about what is the easiest cellular machine that is Turing complete.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:20.080
And it is also such a simple rule that can be defined in one-dimensionally automated machines.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.080
And that means that you look at the initial state as the tape of a Turing machine

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.080
and the rule that is applied on it is what describes how the evolution is going on.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.080
Then you can convert that into any computer.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.080
Who won? Was it Wolfram and Rohan?

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.080
They never really agreed because it depends on what you expect.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:49.080
With Wolfram it was like this, that one of his employees published the machines that they had found all over the place

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080
before Wolfram did that.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.080
Wolfram was so smart that he sued the employee for copyright infringement.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.080
I think in very rare cases in the history of mathematics,

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.080
where a mathematician was sued for copyright for publishing a proof,

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.080
which somehow made many people very angry at Wolfram.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.080
When you talk about Turing complete systems or abstract computers,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.080
they are actually only abstract definitions of computations,

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.080
so what this system can theoretically do.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.080
And it turns out that such systems, Turing complete systems like the Game of Life

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.080
or the abstract computer that Goethe came up with about the piano axioms or a Turing machine,

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.080
what is the difference between these systems?

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.080
Turing complete systems like the Game of Life or the abstract computer

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.080
that Goethe came up with about the piano axioms or a Turing machine,

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.080
which is also an abstract thing, or lambda calculus, and the rules of Wolfram.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.080
In the end, they are any pattern generator.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.080
So all patterns that can be generated can be generated from these things.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:26.080
A pattern is defined as a lot of recognizable differences.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.080
So patterns are discrete, finite structures, but they can be very large.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.080
And now you are at a point where you realize that when you talk about the universe,

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.080
you are actually only talking about a large collection of recognizable differences,

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.080
so a large collection of patterns.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.080
And then you can say, well, the universe for me is the amount of all my observations,

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.080
in my case also the amount of all observations from other people or measuring instruments and so on and so forth.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.080
But in the end, what you mean by the universe, when you refer to the observation,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.080
is a very, very large and yet finally discrete bit vector.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.080
And this can be produced by a Turing complete system.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.080
That is, you are on the level that you simply say, well, from my perspective,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.080
the necessary condition for the amount of all my observations is a Turing complete system,

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:16.080
some pattern generator. And from my perspective, the universe is a random pattern generator.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.080
So that was my step. But I don't know why that's there.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.080
That would be in the field of metaphysics, where cool people like Wolfram, for example,

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:29.080
dare to get out of the field of metaphysics and really want to explain.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.080
Wolfram's idea of physics was, instead of, so to speak,

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.080
to reverse-engineer physics, that is, to transfer our observations from the world

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:43.080
into a series of formulas and then simplify these formulas so far

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.080
that you have less and less at the end. Why is that?

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.080
Standard model is practically half a page full of formulas,

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.080
where you need a long time to understand the individual formulas, what they mean,

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.080
but it's still half a page code, so to speak.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.080
And Wolfram's idea is, of course, that it's still way too long.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.080
There has to be a simple rule from which everything is derived.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080
And what do I think of this simple rule?

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.080
I could simply number all the cellular machines that exist

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.080
and search for something like our universe at the end.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.080
And then I would find out which of these machines we are in.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.080
And the question that is still open, the spoiler,

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.080
Wolfram has not been able to find these machines so far.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.080
And the idea is, I think, brilliant to say that we are trying to search for physics from another series,

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.080
that we are trying to say all possible laws of the series,

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.080
through which the world can be expressed.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.080
This is of course very difficult, because it could be that it is difficult

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.080
to simulate a computer program that comes out clearly over the clock,

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.080
simply because you have to look at so many elements at once.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:50.080
And the other question is, where does this Turing machine come from now?

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.080
So what has this Turing machine done in the lesson?

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080
Why is there something rather than nothing?

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.080
And that is the question that you are confronted with at this level.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.080
And this question has no obvious answer.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.080
By the way, with all theories that are still there,

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080
even if people say they find computation strange,

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.080
so far everyone has had the problem that you need any first cause,

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.080
the first movement or something, why is there nothing?

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.080
Exactly. And Christianity was not so helpful,

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:24.080
because many of these considerations, which played a role in defining a civilization spirit,

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:32.080
so a total god, god is, I think we atheists often don't really understand what god means,

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:39.080
but god is a technical term, and god is something similar to the human self,

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:44.080
the self is a technical term, the self is a model of a person that is created in our brain

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.080
about ourselves, and that we use to move and understand ourselves in the world.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.080
And this includes, for example, that we perceive ourselves as human beings,

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.080
and that we have a biography, and that we make decisions ourselves,

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.080
and have expectations of the future, and have certain identifications.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.080
And all of this is in a self-model and definitely what kind of agent we are,

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.080
so this personal, human self.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.080
And this is not identical to our consciousness.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.080
Our consciousness is also a kind of self, but it is a more minimal self,

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.080
in which practically an observer perceives himself while observing,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.080
even before he has a language or something else,

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.080
and this minimal self is a kind of attention self,

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:31.080
where practically the observer perceives himself as the thing that has attention.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.080
And the personal self is already much more charged up, has much more properties,

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:41.080
it has a first-person perspective and the identification with the way we are in the world.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:48.080
And besides this personal self, from which exactly one normally exists per human spirit,

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.080
then you have such a multiple personality disorder,

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:57.080
there are also selfs that can exist beyond several spirits, and they are called gods.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:03.080
So gods are clusters of agentic properties that stabilize,

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:09.080
and which, for example via memes or through interactions with each other,

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:15.080
or through archetypes, that is, they are discovered regardless of each other on different spirits,

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.080
but because of the same observer, the same world and the same mathematical principles,

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:26.080
they lead to the fact that practically effective agents are created that exist beyond a single spirit.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:32.080
And political societies are some in which the problem of coordination

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.080
over individual self-sufficient agents is solved in such a way that spirits are supported

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.080
in their formation beyond the different spirits.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.080
That is, it is not only the case that the individual people in the world interact with each other,

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.080
but also selfs that do not define themselves as human beings,

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.080
but are there as principles beyond human beings, for example social principles.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.080
For example, there is a god of harvest that leads people to coordinate themselves

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.080
so that they experience themselves as an agent who now brings in the harvest,

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.080
and they all have to serve the individual spirit, the individual body.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:09.080
And in monotheism it is the case that all these gods are made illegal, forbidden,

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.080
and say, no, there is only one god, and that is the god of our civilization.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.080
Originally for the Hebrews it is the god of the tribe,

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.080
and for the Catholics it is the attempt to transfer the Roman Empire,

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.080
which was relatively rational, but also partly political,

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.080
into a kind of cult, and they branched or forged it from the Hebrew cult,

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:36.080
and complemented it with Jesus, the Middle Eastern gnostic,

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.080
who was killed by the Romans at the time because he was too arrogant.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.080
They take him in to define the aesthetics of this new cult,

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080
and then they define a single god.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.080
And we find this single god, each one of us,

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.080
by searching for the perfect god,

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:56.080
so after the one who is created by the fact that everyone does what should be done best.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.080
If you think about it, you can deduce from it what this agent looks like.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.080
Is that what is created when everyone does what should be done best,

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.080
an agent at all, a control system for future conditions?

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.080
Yes, otherwise it would be less perfect.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.080
So it should be something that performs control functions,

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.080
and it should be the perfect thing that performs control functions.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.080
And compared to the Hebrew god, who is then, for example,

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.080
jealous and angry, and makes a lot of decisions,

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.080
from which you ask yourself, is it optimal to use a shark shark rain,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080
or to kill the newborns, or something like that.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.080
This is expanded in Christianity, so to speak.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.080
Then we think, no, we are not looking for what this tribe thought back then,

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.080
what this entity then did, or not,

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.080
but we think about what would happen in the ideal case,

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.080
what is the perfect system.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.080
And the philosophers of Catholicism, especially Thomas Aquinas,

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:50.080
thought very seriously about how to specify this god.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.080
And he put a number of things into the specifications

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.080
that do not belong in there from my point of view.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.080
And I say that now as someone who has no idea about theology

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.080
and who only says it from his personal point of view,

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.080
without any great demand to get it right.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.080
But the idea that the perfect god,

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.080
even the one who created the universe,

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.080
is more or less an empirical question for me,

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.080
that I can decide a priori.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.080
So to consider whether God is an agent,

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.080
if I try to see him as an optimal agent,

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.080
which results in everyone who discovers him serving him,

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.080
I see that one can derive this a priori,

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.080
under certain circumstances, without any conditions.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:35.080
But the idea that our universe was created by him,

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.080
that does not really show up.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.080
From my point of view, it is true that the monotheistic god

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080
was discovered only 6,000 years ago,

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080
and before that there are no traces of it.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.080
And that means that it is in its form a human discovery.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.080
And this human discovery is possibly not an absolute discovery,

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.080
but has had certain conditions

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.080
that people had to develop certain cultures

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.080
that brought them to these ideas.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.080
And this entity may actually only arise

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.080
through the interaction of people

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.080
who discover this entity and want to serve it.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.080
That means as a civilisation spirit,

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.080
not as a creator god who created a physical universe.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080
So there is a trick,

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.080
that you try to bring together the unknown

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.080
with an answer that is comfortable,

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.080
and the one with this god of civilisation,

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.080
with whom you try to discipline and harmonize your population,

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.080
and to make your behaviour coherent.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080
And I think that's how you get into trouble,

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.080
if you don't bring this back to an empirical question.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.080
Practically, this also leads to logical contradictions,

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.080
because this god is not structureless,

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.080
he has properties, so that he can be effective.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080
He has to be structural.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080
And that means that he is not free of conditions.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.080
And he is not suitable as a condition for the physical universe.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.080
So if he is a condition for the physical universe,

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.080
then the physical universe becomes a kind of simulation

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080
that is created by him, is conceivable.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.080
Maybe our god is a being

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.080
that existed in the next higher universe,

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.080
and created this universe as a kind of computer simulation.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.080
But that doesn't change the fact,

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.080
that this next higher universe

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.080
also has to be conceivable in some language.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.080
In the broadest sense, with some mathematical language.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.080
And that's where this god has to fall out.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.080
How do I get this precondition-free universe

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.080
where the world is created by itself?

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.080
And this question, why is there anything at all,

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:36.080
is a question that I haven't seen a satisfying answer for a long time.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.080
And for me it was the point where I realized,

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.080
okay, now it's working.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.080
When I read a text by the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce,

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.080
he wrote about existence and non-existence

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080
in this short chapter.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.080
And he states that you can describe the non-existence

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.080
by zero and the existence by one.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080
And then he says,

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080
you could also describe the non-existence

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.080
by the negation of existence,

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.080
so by minus one.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.080
So there is one way to exist

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.080
and two ways not to exist.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.080
And I read that and thought,

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.080
that's nonsense.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.080
You didn't discover that there is one way to exist

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.080
and two ways not to exist,

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080
but you found labels

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.080
for existence and non-existence.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.080
And there are infinitely many,

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.080
so unlimitedly many,

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.080
that you can create.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.080
And what you used

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.080
and put forward for that

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.080
is a system of numbers.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.080
And the piano axiom,

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080
this system of numbers,

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.080
is so powerful that you can build

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.080
a whole universe out of it,

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.080
so it's not conditional.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080
That means you trick yourself,

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.080
you pretend that zero and one

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.080
are already there out of nothing.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.080
And from that you talk about existence

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080
and non-existence.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080
But can we talk about non-existence

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.080
out of existence?

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.080
Actually not, right?

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.080
That means we can't talk about existence

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.080
and non-existence

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.080
at the lowest level of the universe

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.080
because there is nothing there.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080
That means the universe itself

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.080
outside of itself

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.080
is not determined

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.080
about its existence and non-existence.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.080
It doesn't know if it exists or not.

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.080
And that means,

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.080
if I assume it's conditional,

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.080
that the default,

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.080
is not that the universe doesn't exist

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.080
or that there is nothing there,

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.080
but that you can't know

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.080
if it exists or not.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.080
If the universe is possible,

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.080
that means there is an existing

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.080
and non-existent branch.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080
And the non-existent branch

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.080
doesn't contain any observers

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080
who will complain.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.080
And all the observers who have complaints

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.080
are us in the existing branch.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080
And what we have to explain now

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.080
is that after we have

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.080
derived from the existence

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.080
and the fact that

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.080
there is nothing in the universe

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.080
that prevents that,

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.080
why are certain things there

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.080
and other things not there?

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.080
Why does the universe

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.080
have this structure

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080
and not everything?

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.080
And the simplest answer is

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.080
that the universe is simply everything.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.080
That means that the universe

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.080
is possibly used by all machines.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080
How does it look exactly?

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.080
We can take one more step

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.080
before the Turing machine.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080
The Turing machine

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.080
that we normally use,

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.080
this tape with the one head reader,

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.080
is a way to talk about

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.080
the calculation.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.080
And it has an interesting feature,

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.080
it has an exact sequence state

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080
for every starting state.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.080
And this sequence state

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.080
is deterministic,

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.080
that means there is no coincidence,

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080
but when the same starting state is

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
exactly in the same sequence state.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.080
The difference between deterministic

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.080
and non-deterministic functions

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.080
from this point of view would be

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080
that a non-deterministic function

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080
that can give a different result every time,

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080
would be a deterministic function

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080
every time under the same conditions

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080
that gives the same result.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080
And the other feature

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080
besides the determinism of the Turing machine

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080
is that it is linear.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.080
That means that every state

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080
has a different function.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080
But I could also define it differently.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.080
I could make one that is stochastic,

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.080
that happens to go into one of several

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.080
whether it is linear or non-linear.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080
But you need coincidence.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080
Yes, but the coincidence only means

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080
that I have to define a function

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.080
that gives me a different result every time.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.080
And that means that it cannot be

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.080
compressed over time,

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.080
but it is different every time,

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.080
and you can do that,

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.080
it just gets very long.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.080
I could also make it branched.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.080
If I make a Turing machine

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080
that does not have one subsequent state,

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080
but has several subsequent states,

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080
then it will have more branches

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.080
in every state, so to speak.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.080
And that is, in the mathematical sense,

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.080
a non-deterministic Turing machine.

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.080
That is one that is not so defined

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.080
that I only have one subsequent state,

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.080
but is less constrained.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.080
That means it can go into several,

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.080
because you can't only decide for one.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.080
It's a bit of an unhappy label,

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.080
because non-deterministic sounds

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.080
a bit esoteric as if it's a real coincidence,

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.080
but you can't define it at all,

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.080
observe, formalize.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.080
Yes, we can define the real coincidence

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.080
by simply saying that our function

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080
must or can give us a different value every time.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080
But I don't quite understand that,

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.080
because the real coincidence

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080
is the problem that you have to get

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080
something out of nothing.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080
No, you don't have to.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.080
There is, for example,

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.080
if you want to decode things,

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.080
the problem is that you can

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080
get the key out

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.080
with mathematical operations,

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.080
which regularity you have

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.080
executed in mathematics,

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080
to connect the key

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080
with the text,

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.080
so that you get the result.

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.080
But there is a trick with which

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.080
you can get the key out,

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.080
and that is the one-time-pad.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.080
The one-time-pad uses a key

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.080
that is just as long as the text you want to decode.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.080
And you exchange it

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.080
so that you only use it once.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.080
That means you meet

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.080
with your secret agent at the beginning,

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.080
and you both use a key

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.080
that you generate in such a way

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.080
that no one else can know,

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.080
and it's only used once.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080
And each of you has a copy of this key.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.080
And you calculate this key

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080
together with your text every time.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080
And everything you used,

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.080
you throw away and burn it.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080
And you always know exactly

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080
where you are on your blog,

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.080
where you have this long key on it.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.080
And because this function

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.080
is not known to anyone else,

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.080
so you interact with the other universe

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.080
until you let it interact,

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.080
this function, from the point of view

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.080
of every observer, is absolutely random.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.080
Okay, yes, of course, from the point of view

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.080
of every observer anyway,

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.080
who often solve themselves

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.080
and think that basically

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.080
in the substrate universe

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080
there are undetermined things

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080
and there you don't need anything.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.080
Yes, but that just means

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.080
in practice there is a bubble

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.080
that is hermetically separated

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080
from the rest of the universe

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.080
and is exactly the same format.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.080
There is no difference.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.080
If we formalize this in a language,

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.080
it is by chance nothing else

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.080
than a source that was

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.080
nothing in connection with the universe

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.080
and there are values that have not been known to you.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.080
Okay, I'll buy one.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.080
So in this respect this is not a problem.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.080
But the non-deterministic Turing machine

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.080
was chosen for another reason,

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.080
because it is deterministic.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.080
That is, if I have a machine

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.080
that goes into several states at the same time,

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.080
that goes in parallel,

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.080
there is no coincidence in it,

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.080
but it just goes into all these states.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.080
The non-determinism comes about

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.080
by the fact that when I am calculated

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.080
in the Turing machine,

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.080
I do not know in which branch I am.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.080
Copies of me are in all other branches,

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.080
but there is no criterion

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.080
that tells me in which branch I go in,

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
because these branches

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.080
just all exist in parallel.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080
They are not somehow privileged from each other.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.080
That is, it is not the case that

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.080
one is calculated more than the other

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.080
or has any properties that

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.080
differ from the others,

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.080
which you can check by looking at the others,

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080
because the branches do not see each other

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.080
The thing that is a coincidence,

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080
so to speak, only affects you

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080
if you are the observer

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.080
who is calculated by the machine.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.080
As a student, I got to know this

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.080
non-deterministic Turing machine

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.080
as an undergrad,

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080
in basic studies,

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.080
in complexity theory,

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.080
as a method to measure

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080
how the complexity of algorithms is.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.080
I saw this as unimportant,

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.080
because I can emulate this

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.080
non-deterministic Turing machine

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.080
by simply giving the normal Turing machine

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.080
a stack, and every time

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.080
I do a branch,

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.080
I add the condition to the stack,

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080
and later I go back to this point

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.080
and then have to calculate

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.080
the branch in the other direction.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.080
This makes it completely equivalent.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.080
The disadvantage is that

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.080
this non-deterministic Turing machine

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.080
of course needs more memory.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.080
I have to calculate the stack

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.080
and need more calculation steps.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080
And vice versa,

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.080
it is also equivalent.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.080
I can calculate the non-deterministic Turing machine

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.080
by simply ensuring

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.080
that there is only one path

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.080
that I look at.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.080
This is a real amount,

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.080
and they are

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.080
at a certain point

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.080
equivalent,

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080
if I take into account that

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080
one needs more memory

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.080
and calculation time than the other.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.080
But there are practical differences.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080
For example, I imagine

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.080
that our brain

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.080
is not a Turing machine,

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.080
but the individual neuron

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080
does not go through

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.080
100% determinism in the next state

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.080
when its environment is in this and that state,

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.080
but it goes through a certain

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.080
probability in that state.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.080
This means that if I have

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.080
a population of neurons next to each other

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.080
that have about the same environment

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.080
and have a certain amount of coincidence,

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.080
then they behave

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.080
similarly to a non-deterministic Turing machine.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.080
That is, they are not so constrained

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.080
that they only go down one path,

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.080
but they sample a whole state space.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.080
They not only do one function,

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.080
but they calculate several variants

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.080
of this function at the same time.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.080
The substrate, of course,

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.080
has a limited resolution,

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.080
that is, the paths interact with each other

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080
and this leads to the fact that

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.080
these states can collapse,

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.080
the neurons can finally vote

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.080
on the result.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.080
But the interesting thing is that our brain

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.080
and our reasoning processes,

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080
which our mind runs through,

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.080
have to be described in such a way that we do not

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080
go through a sequence of states step by step,

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080
but that we at the same time go through

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080
a space of possible states in parallel.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.080
And this space then votes with each other

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080
and collapses again.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080
And if we try to go backwards through our thoughts,

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.080
we do not know in what states we have been,

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.080
because all these paths

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:11.080
have no traces left.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.080
Nobody has noticed in what states we have all been.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.080
And we can reconstruct a path,

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.080
that is, if we model our brain

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080
as a stochastic,

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.080
non-deterministic Turing machine

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.080
with a limited substrate resolution,

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.080
we have a slightly different paradigm

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.080
than a deterministic Turing machine

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080
that is calculated on a von Neumann computer.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.080
Even if it would still be implementable on it?

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.080
Yes, it is still implementable on it, exactly.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.080
This leads to confusion

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.080
in some philosophers,

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.080
for example the integrated information theory,

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080
which is the consciousness theory

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.080
of Tononi and his students.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.080
Philosophers believe in something like this.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.080
Tononi says that

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080
he can imagine

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.080
that you can build a neuromorphic computer,

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.080
one that behaves similarly,

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.080
even if it is built artificially,

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.080
like the distributed processes

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.080
of the information calculation of our brain,

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.080
that it can be conscious.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.080
That it says, I feel, so I have consciousness.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080
But a von Neumann computer,

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080
the one we have implemented

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.080
as a digital computer,

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.080
which works sequentially, does not.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080
And this leads to a problem,

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080
namely that

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080
we can,

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.080
through the Turing thesis,

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.080
which Tononi does not agree on,

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.080
prove that we can

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.080
emulate the neuromorphic computer

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.080
on the sequential computer.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.080
That means we can build a computer

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080
on the von Neumann computer

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.080
that behaves exactly like the neuromorphic computer.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.080
They are completely equivalent.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.080
And that means that it also says,

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.080
I feel, so I am.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080
In any case, it is a lie,

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.080
because it cannot feel anything

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.080
in the way it is conscious.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.080
And that leads to the problem

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.080
that consciousness would be an epiphenomenon.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.080
That is, that our statements,

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.080
that we are conscious,

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080
are not caused by consciousness itself,

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080
but we move our mouth mechanically by chance

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080
as if it were caused by consciousness,

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080
but it is not.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080
Consciousness, so to speak,

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.080
quietly on the side and observes

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.080
our physical realities in our mind,

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.080
which some people say, I have no consciousness,

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.080
others say, I have a consciousness,

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.080
and it cannot influence it somehow.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.080
And epiphenomenonism is therefore

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.080
not a good theory,

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.080
because epiphenomenonists are not epiphenomenonists,

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.080
so they say, my consciousness

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.080
will not be physically effective,

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.080
because they have consciousness.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080
Consciousness does not cause epiphenomenonism.

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.080
The mouth movements of epiphenomenonist

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.080
philosophers are not caused by his consciousness.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.080
And that is a very stupid theory,

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.080
which is why Tononi would not sign.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.080
And that means, however,

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.080
that the integrated information theory,

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080
if you have it in such a form,

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.080
as Tononi has it,

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080
leads to a completely insolvent contradiction.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.080
If you dissolve it, then only

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080
global workspace theory remains.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.080
But this is not a real theory,

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.080
but a framework, actually.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.080
It is more of a framework.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.080
But it does not explain functionally

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.080
how it comes to such states.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.080
But that's what it means for me as a computer scientist,

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.080
I look at it with a certain indifference

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.080
and do not quite understand how you can do that.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.080
For me, this is more of a control group,

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.080
a theory that has such an obvious logical contradiction

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.080
that a computer scientist in elementary school

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.080
recognizes that. How can you represent that?

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080
So we have existence and non-existence at the same time.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.080
And we are now in the second phase of existence.

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.080
And the simplest form of this

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.080
existing phase is

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.080
that we apply all operators

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.080
in parallel.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.080
And this means that the universe simply

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.080
branches, in every step,

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.080
maximum branching,

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.080
because there is no selection function

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080
for the operators. That means

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080
that all operators are simply applied.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.080
And an operator is a function

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.080
that takes a pattern from noticeable differences

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.080
and converts it into another

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.080
pattern from noticeable differences.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.080
And all operators are simply

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.080
applied, and some of these operators

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.080
are very often applied, because they are

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.080
simple and often, and others are very rare.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.080
And this leads to an interesting concept

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.080
of identity, because

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:05.080
there is no one.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080
What exists now is, for example, that

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.080
the photon would be, in this way,

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080
an operator,

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.080
which always takes place

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.080
when there is an environment on which this operator

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.080
fits. So if, so to speak,

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.080
there is a photon-shaped hole in the universe,

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080
then this photon operator is used

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.080
and shifts the environment

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.080
so that

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.080
the same hole is created,

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.080
plus a little bit further away.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.080
And this way this photon operator

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.080
fits again in the next step.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.080
That is, this is a sequence of

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.080
related operators

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080
that can be applied one by one,

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.080
which leads to the fact that a pattern

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:43.080
continues in the space,

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.080
just like the glider in Game of Life.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.080
With the difference that the space is not

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.080
given at all, regardless of the patterns,

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.080
but the space first arises by

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.080
the fact that I collect certain noticeable

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.080
differences in such a way that a

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.080
pattern is created that can be described as a space.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.080
That is, the photon is an operator

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.080
or a sequence of operator

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.080
applications that lead to

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.080
that first a regularity is created

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.080
in which information can

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.080
spread and interact with

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.080
other information.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.080
And that just results

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.080
by the fact that these operators

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.080
are possible.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.080
And again to translate,

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.080
the base level reality,

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.080
that is, the lowest level of reality,

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.080
has nothing that goes ahead of it.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.080
That is practically the definition of base level reality.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.080
Every other reality that goes ahead

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.080
is practically a kind of simulation reality

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.080
where in the

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.080
parents' universe a computer

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.080
stands in some form

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.080
on which this underlying reality

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.080
runs. And the physicalism

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.080
is the idea that in our world

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.080
there is a mechanical amount of rules,

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.080
so not some refined

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.080
computer program in which

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.080
a programmer can intervene at any time,

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.080
but simply

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.080
a causally closed

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.080
amount of simple rules

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.080
from which everything emerges.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.080
And that we are already in this base reality.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.080
And the idea that is here

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.080
is that this base level

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.080
reality, because it has no priors,

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.080
nothing that goes ahead of it,

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.080
can be described

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.080
as simply everything that is possible

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.080
exists in it. And that

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.080
we exist in the space of all these

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.080
possibilities.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.080
And the universe is a

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.080
tautology, so mathematically

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.080
tautology is something that exists

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.080
without conditions, for example A is equal to A

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.080
exists through the axiom of identity

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.080
in classical logic.

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.080
And that means that nothing new is said,

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.080
but it just results

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.080
from the assumption of these rules

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.080
as if there are no conditions.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.080
Tautology are all these conditions

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.080
where nothing new is said.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.080
And it can be described

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.080
as a non-deterministic

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.080
Turing machine,

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.080
so this machine that branches,

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.080
in this case in all branches,

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.080
and with all

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.080
Kolmogorov complexity of zero.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.080
And Kolmogorov complexity

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.080
describes how complicated the algorithm

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.080
is.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.080
Kolmogorov had the idea

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.080
that you can describe for different computer programs

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.080
or for different

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.080
functions how complicated they are.

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.080
By this, how long

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.080
is the program that you need

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.080
to define this function?

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.080
If you, like

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.080
Stephen Wolfram, try to find a function

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.080
from which our universe emerges,

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.080
then this function has

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080
no length of zero, but it is an

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.080
automatic machine that needs a certain

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.080
number of steps to write it down

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.080
and a certain number of bits

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.080
to write it down.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.080
And that would be the number of bits

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.080
that you need to write down an algorithm,

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.080
that would be the Kolmogorov complexity.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.080
There is a problem

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.080
with Kolmogorov complexity.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.080
When I write down the different computer languages,

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.080
they are different in length, depending on the language.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.080
In practice, the problem is not that big,

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.080
because I can often

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.080
translate into these languages,

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.080
and this translation program is not very long,

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.080
so that I have a pretty good idea of what

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.080
the shortest is.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.080
There are limits

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.080
where it is difficult, but in practice

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.080
the problem is not that big.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.080
The Solomonov induction has similar problems.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.080
Exactly.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.080
The Solomonov induction basically describes

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.080
what a modeling system does.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.080
For example, our mind,

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.080
Ray Solomonov had the idea

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.080
to systematize it

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.080
through a kind of Kolmogorov complexity.

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.080
He says that

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.080
what a mind does at the end of the day is that

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.080
it tries to predict the present

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.080
from the previous observations

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.080
through the shortest possible program,

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.080
that is, with the shortest possible Kolmogorov complexity.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.080
For all pairs of current and

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.080
previous observations.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.080
What I just said informally

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.080
is very nice to write down formally.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.080
With this, you have a specification

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.080
for a universal modeling system,

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.080
which has the disadvantage

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.080
that it is so general

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.080
that you can't calculate it yet.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.080
That means you have to find something

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.080
in practice that somehow

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.080
brings the Solomonov induction closer.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.080
But back to the Kolmogorov complexity,

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.080
if we are in the base-level reality,

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.080
then there is no program

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.080
that is below this base-level reality.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.080
That means it has to be in tautology.

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.080
That means the Kolmogorov complexity

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.080
of our universe should be zero.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.080
That means a program of length zero.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.080
And the easiest program of length zero,

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.080
if you do not assume

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.080
that length zero is nothing,

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.080
but all possibilities,

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.080
is simply applied to all operators.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.080
And that means every operator is applied

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.080
wherever it fits.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.080
There is always an operator

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.080
that fits in our world relatively often,

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.080
because there are many photon-shaped holes,

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.080
because the photon is relatively simple.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.080
But you and I, we are operators

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.080
that are very rare, that are very rarely used,

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.080
because we need a relatively complex

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.080
environment to exist.

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.080
And that means we only appear

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.080
very, very rarely in our universe.

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.080
And then there are

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.080
some operators

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.080
that can only appear once,

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.080
namely on the one hand the Highlander.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.080
You can only enter one of them,

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.080
it is defined like this.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.080
And then the universe itself,

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.080
the entirety of all possibilities that exist.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.080
And Stephen Wolfram calls it the Rolyard.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.080
That is the thing that occurs

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.080
because you apply all operators

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.080
unlimitedly to each other.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.080
Can you repeat the name

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.080
in English?

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.080
The entangled limit of everything.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.080
The entangled limit of all possible computations.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.080
But say it in English.

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.080
The entangled limit of all possible computations.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.080
I don't like it that much,

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.080
because there are so many terms in there

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.080
that you have to explain first.

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.080
For example, what does entangled mean at the point?

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.080
And what is meant by that?

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.080
That they all hang together on one big thing.

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.080
That there is a path

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.080
in every direction, in every direction.

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.080
And limit means in the case that

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080
it is actually unlimited.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.080
In some places it is not unlimited.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.080
Locally it is often the case

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.080
that when I have this Turing machine

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080
and I have a branch,

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.080
then I don't always get

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.080
unlimited different states,

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.080
but sometimes the pattern is created by itself.

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.080
That means the branches meet

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.080
in a certain way by

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.080
creating the same patterns

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.080
on different paths.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.080
That does not mean that they physically meet

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.080
and collide again,

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.080
but that when I try to write down

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.080
this calculation or to model from the outside,

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.080
that I often don't have so many different states

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.080
in which it goes,

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.080
and that means, for example,

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.080
that when I describe the particle,

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.080
then it is so that the individual particle

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.080
is often defined in such a way

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.080
that there is not only a possibility

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.080
in which it can exist, but there are many paths

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.080
that it can take, but many paths

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.080
then meet again. And where they meet,

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.080
there is again a convergence.

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.080
And this convergence leads to

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.080
that a part of the universe can predict

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.080
what another part of the universe will do.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.080
And that is the prerequisite

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.080
for the creation of structure.

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:57.080
The structure of the universe is created

01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.080
by the fact that there is control.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.080
That is, a part of the universe can predict

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.080
what another part of the universe can do

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.080
and this part of the universe

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.080
can adjust to the other

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.080
and thus produce the local,

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.080
more stable structures.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.080
And in a place where this does not happen,

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.080
there is no interaction and therefore no control.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.080
And that means that there is then

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.080
no interesting structure,

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.080
but these are just random fluctuations.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.080
And what you would expect

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.080
is that you find a lowest level

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.080
in which there are very, very many

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.080
random fluctuations,

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.080
which lead to nothing,

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.080
which are therefore not predictable

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.080
and are created by the fact that you do not know

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.080
in which path you end.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.080
All paths are going at the same time,

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.080
you are always on a certain path of them

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.080
and in your path,

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.080
which splits up all the time,

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.080
that is, every bit in your universe

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.080
changes in a random way all the time,

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.080
there are these whole splinters

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.080
and most of these splinters

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.080
do nothing and sometimes

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.080
they swing up to a structure

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.080
and this structure gets bigger and bigger

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.080
depending on how strong

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.080
it leads to control processes.

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.080
And on the simplest level,

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.080
the control processes that occur

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.080
are particles that lead

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.080
to something like a space

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.080
being created in which

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.080
the particles can be assigned a momentum.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.080
The momentum is the direction

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.080
from which the particles come

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.080
and the space is addressable,

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.080
that is, you can adjust to it,

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.080
what comes from this direction?

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.080
And these structures lead to

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.080
that these particles,

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.080
something like elemental particles,

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.080
form, that is, swirls that arise from these particles

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.080
that become stable and these swirls

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.080
can then, I can try mathematically

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.080
to guide which swirls are technically possible

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.080
because I apply such functions

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.080
to each other and at some point

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.080
such swirls arise from swirls

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.080
and these are the atoms

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.080
and there is a whole zoo

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.080
of such atoms that are stable

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.080
under these conditions.

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.080
And this zoo of atoms,

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.080
the physics has not yet figured out

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.080
how they can all guide them.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.080
But the suspicion is that

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.080
there is a possibility, ultimately from the theory of numbers,

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.080
to guide the periodic table of elements

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.080
and to think about which things

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.080
are stable under which conditions

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.080
for how long and in which spaces,

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.080
how high-dimensional they are.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.080
And what stands out, for example, is

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.080
that most things are only stable

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.080
in the three-dimensional space.

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.080
That is, the electromagnetism,

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.080
the forces with which

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.080
the atoms interact,

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.080
are ultimately all in this three-dimensional space.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.080
So the photons and neutrinos

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.080
and so on are generations

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.080
of the same particle classes.

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.080
They all find themselves in

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.080
such a confined three-dimensional space

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080
in which we are.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080
And the strong force and the weak force

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.080
are only within the atomic nucleus

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.080
and do not affect each other

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.080
over such a long distance.

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.080
Possibly this is due to the fact that

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.080
they form whirlpools in higher spaces

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.080
than in three-dimensional spaces.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.080
And mathematically you can show that

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.080
rotation, so to speak,

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.080
is possible in two dimensions,

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.080
and in four dimensions,

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.080
and in eight dimensions.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.080
But not more in sixteen dimensions.

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.080
They get a little more complicated every time.

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.080
And if you think about

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.080
what a whirlpool formation actually is,

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.080
for example, imagine

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.080
that you are in a bathtub

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.080
and you move your hand and observe

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:19.080
the whirlpools that form

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.080
on the surface of the bathtub,

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.080
most of these waves

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.080
disappear after a short time

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.080
in the background.

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:29.080
And the ones that are stable, so to speak,

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.080
are round whirlpools that remain

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:33.080
and that, like particles,

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.080
pull along the surface of the bathtub

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.080
as long as they either

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.080
go into other whirlpools

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.080
or disappear by friction,

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.080
or by interacting

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.080
with other things,

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.080
for example your hand

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.080
or something like that.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.080
But for themselves they are stable.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.080
This is due to the fact that

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.080
they rotate exactly into themselves.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.080
That is, that they have an exact angle

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.080
in their momentum,

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.080
that the information remains constant

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.080
in the volume and does not disappear

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.080
from this volume, that is,

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.080
flows out into the room.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.080
For example, if I look at rotation

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.080
in some discrete vector spaces

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.080
or something like that,

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.080
is that the mathematical formalization

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.080
of these whirlpools?

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.080
Yes, so if you think about it,

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.080
what is a rotation?

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.080
It is an operation for 2D,

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.080
a vector operation in a

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.080
two-dimensional space.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.080
If we think about it,

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.080
what do dimensions actually mean?

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.080
We get the first dimension

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.080
by taking our whole numbers

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.080
in the whirlpooling scheme

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.080
as a kind of number stream.

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.080
We had found that

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.080
processes and sequences are sufficient

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.080
to move around on a number stream

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.080
when it is ordered.

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:49.080
And then we can use additions

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.080
to teleport and zoom with multiplication.

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.080
And the same thing works

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.080
with two-dimensional numbers.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.080
Two-dimensional numbers are created

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.080
by taking our number stream

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.080
and folding it, for example.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.080
In the computer you can create

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.080
the one-dimensional address space

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.080
where every memory cell

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080
in the computer gets an address.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.080
From which I can determine the process

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.080
like on a Turing machine

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.080
where one cell moves forward and backward.

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.080
You can also simply say,

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.080
I'm going 100 steps forward

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.080
and I get to the next cell of my array.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.080
And this simple operation,

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.080
right and left, I do plus or minus 1

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.080
and up and down I do plus or minus 100.

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.080
This way I have a possibility

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:31.080
to fold my number stream in the computer

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.080
into a lattice.

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.080
And this lattice

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.080
is a simple way to make it two-dimensional.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.080
There are many possibilities.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.080
I can do this as a spiral,

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.080
then I have something like polar coordinates.

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.080
Or as a Hilbert curve

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.080
that fills space.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.080
And there are many tricks

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.080
with which you can fill the space

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.080
in such a way that you always get

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.080
smaller 8-core points

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.080
and get such an unboundedness.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.080
And in this two-dimensional number space

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.080
that I can calculate all together,

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080
these two-dimensional lattice,

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.080
I can define a rotation

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.080
as an additional operation.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.080
So first of all I can do two-dimensional addition.

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:11.080
That means I teleport

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.080
into two dimensions.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.080
I can also zoom into two dimensions

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.080
by multiplying my vector,

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.080
my coordinate pair

01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:21.080
with a one-dimensional number.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.080
I zoom in and out.

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.080
But I can also rotate

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.080
by using the second coordinate

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.080
by multiplying with the complex number.

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.080
Rotating leads to

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.080
that I can build a structure

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.080
that remains constant

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.080
even though I move it

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.080
away from the dimension.

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.080
In the simplest case I rotate

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.080
it by 90 degrees.

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.080
And I can also rotate it

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.080
in parts of 90 degrees

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.080
if I manage to define a function

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.080
with which I can make the intervals smaller.

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:55.080
And the function

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.080
with which I can keep a structure constant

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.080
even though I make the intervals smaller

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:01.080
is a rotation.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.080
A kind of continuous permutation.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.080
And if I want to keep a dynamic structure

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.080
constant,

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.080
so that the information does not dissipate

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.080
under information maintenance conditions,

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.080
then it has to be a kind of rotation.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.080
Something where the information

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.080
rotates back in itself.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.080
And such rotations,

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.080
the easiest ones, are a multiplication

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:25.080
with a complex number, with a two-dimensional number.

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.080
And the thing is that

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.080
in two dimensions

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:31.080
this works, but in three dimensions

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.080
I can only

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.080
perform two-dimensional rotations,

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.080
not three-dimensional.

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.080
If you think about it, if we rotate something in 3D,

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.080
then it's always about an axis in a plane.

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.080
This is because in 3D

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.080
there are no complex numbers,

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.080
like an i,

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.080
in complex numbers there are no

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:53.080
i and j,

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.080
which have this property

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.080
that you can define multiplications

01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.080
that lead to a constant

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.080
of the pattern.

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.080
This means that all three-dimensional rotations

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:05.080
are two-dimensional.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.080
We only use a subset

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.080
of the three dimensions.

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.080
There is always a certain exception to this.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:13.080
For example smoke rings.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.080
A smoke ring is a torus

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:17.080
that rotates around a circle.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.080
And this works

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.080
because you can compress the air.

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.080
In order for the torus to rotate,

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.080
you have to compress the air

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.080
on the inside of the smoke ring

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.080
while it turns inside and

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:31.080
extends outwards.

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.080
This works because the air is elastic.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:35.080
That's why you can blow

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.080
air rings underwater.

01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.080
Many people do it for fun,

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.080
because the air is compressible.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.080
But you can't blow water rings underwater,

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.080
because the water is not compressible.

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.080
The compressibility of the air

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.080
means that the space is crumpled.

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.080
It is weakly four-dimensional.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.080
This smoke ring is a rotation

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.080
that is only possible in three-dimensional space,

01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.080
because the three-dimensional space

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.080
has a little more than three dimensions

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:03.080
if you can compress it.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.080
In four dimensions,

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.080
I can define new rotations.

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:09.080
For example, I can take a ball

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.080
and rotate it around itself

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.080
so that the inside turns outwards.

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:15.080
This is not possible in three-dimensional space,

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.080
because the surface will overlap with itself.

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.080
But in four-dimensional space,

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:21.080
I have an additional dimension.

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.080
That means I have a rotation

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:25.080
where I rotate 360 degrees,

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.080
but it is not as precise as before.

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.080
I tried to rotate a circle,

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.080
but I have to rotate 360 degrees

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.080
another time

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.080
so that I get back to my starting point.

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.080
So I rotate 720 degrees

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.080
so that I get around it.

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.080
Interestingly,

01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.080
in music there are rotations

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.080
where you have to rotate 360 degrees

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.080
so that you get back to your starting point.

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:49.080
These are spinors.

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.080
It is really cool

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.080
that you can get into mathematics

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:55.080
and derive from the theory of numbers

01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.080
what rotations are possible.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.080
The cool thing is that these spinor spaces

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.080
are the algebras in which rotations are possible.

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:03.080
That is the Fredkin thing, isn't it?

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.080
I don't think Fredkin discovered it.

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.080
I don't know who discovered it first.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.080
I can't give a reference,

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:11.080
but a friend of mine

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.080
gave me a series of texts.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.080
Unfortunately, I lost the source.

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.080
You have to ask who it was.

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:19.080
It is that you can derive

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.080
the rotations from the theory of numbers

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.080
and create the reference to quantum mechanics.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.080
What I find interesting

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:27.080
philosophically and genealogically

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.080
is that with methods

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.080
of natural sciences

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.080
or computer science

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.080
in the end,

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.080
you define it as a new

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.080
rationalist program of philosophy.

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.080
Of course.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.080
And I find that funny

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.080
that rationalism

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:47.080
finds the way back

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.080
into philosophy

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.080
via stem or something like that.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:53.080
That is a nice way back.

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.080
I would express it a little differently.

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.080
In my opinion,

01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.080
we have a number of

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.080
philosophical fundamental questions.

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.080
The famous four questions of philosophy.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.080
What is going on?

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.080
Why does this happen to me?

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.080
What should I do?

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:13.080
That is the ethics.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.080
And what can I know?

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.080
Epistemology,

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.080
ontology,

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:21.080
ethics and metaphysics.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.080
These questions can be put

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.080
by computationalism

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.080
on a common basis.

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:29.080
Computationalism is nothing

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.080
other than the amount of all formal languages.

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.080
And the subset is implementable.

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.080
And after we have seen

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.080
that some of the formal languages

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:41.080
are not implementable,

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.080
there are specifications

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.080
such as the hairdresser

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.080
who cuts the beard of all men

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:49.080
who shave themselves,

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.080
which leads to contradictions.

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.080
We only cut out the languages

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:55.080
that are implementable.

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.080
And these are the computational languages.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.080
And after I realized that all these

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:01.080
languages are also equally powerful,

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:03.080
that I can represent each one

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:05.080
through each other,

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.080
if they are so powerful that I can build a computer with them,

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.080
I have a system with which I can describe reality.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.080
Every possible language in which

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.080
something can be represented,

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.080
but also every language in which

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.080
structural education is possible.

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.080
And that allows me

01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.080
to unite

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.080
the philosophy into a system.

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:25.080
And of course I am not the first

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.080
who has done this.

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.080
But the interesting thing is that

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.080
the longer I do this,

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.080
the later the parties get.

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.080
And what is fascinating for me

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.080
is that I did not find out

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.080
anything about it in my own studies.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.080
And I was very depressed

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:43.080
that these things, these building blocks,

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.080
were not put together in a way that was not recognizable to me.

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:47.080
And I do not have the claim

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.080
to say that this is a good alternative

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:51.080
to what my philosophy teachers have done

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:53.080
in my studies,

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.080
but in the end I am just a guy

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.080
who has existential questions

01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:59.080
and who has the same questions from other people

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.080
as I do.

01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:03.080
And to form a system in which I can understand

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.080
how thinking works

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.080
and who we are, and how consciousness

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:09.080
and language and representation

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:11.080
can work, but also how existence

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.080
can work. And all of this

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:15.080
all fits together.

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.080
In addition to the

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.080
split

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.080
by the non-deterministic Turing machine,

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.080
on the one hand,

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.080
because a lot of operators are used

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.080
in every condition,

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.080
we have a loss of information

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:33.080
all the time.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.080
Because only the things that

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.080
are controllable, that are controllable

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.080
and stabilize, they stay.

01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.080
And all other things are just

01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.080
new to us

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.080
or they disappear completely.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.080
Nevertheless, there are

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.080
these branches.

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:53.080
And that would mean that we accept

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.080
something like a multiversum theory,

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.080
unless we assume

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.080
that it is only certain branches

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.080
that are allowed to stabilize at all,

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:03.080
right?

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:05.080
That does not exclude both. The thing is

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:07.080
that it is often the case that several branches

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.080
are allowed to stabilize, but you still

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.080
do not know which one you are.

01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:13.080
That means that you get a situation

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:15.080
that you have a double split experiment

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:17.080
and you do not know through which split

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:19.080
the photon goes, because it goes

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.080
through the whole split, but not

01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.080
through your path. In your path

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:25.080
it only goes through one.

01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:27.080
And you do not know which path it is.

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:29.080
As an observer who is embedded

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.080
and coexists with this photon,

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:33.080
you do not know if you are in the path

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:35.080
where the photon goes through the right or left split.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.080
The only thing you can say is that

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:39.080
if you look at millions of photons,

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.080
then there will be the following statistical

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.080
pattern about the interactions.

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.080
And this statistical pattern

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:47.080
you can say in advance. And the photon

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:49.080
is also such a statistical pattern.

01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:51.080
That means that this is also a regularity

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.080
that results in structures in the universe

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.080
beginning to be so predictable

01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:57.080
for each other that they

01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.080
can stabilize.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.080
Okay, and how do I make sure

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.080
that I'm always on the right path?

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.080
Yes, I think

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:07.080
that's a totally nice greeting

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.080
that you can derive from it,

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.080
that you say, do you always

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.080
want to be in the best path

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.080
in the multiverse?

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.080
But the thing is that this multiverse

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.080
does not, so to speak,

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.080
arise from the fact that the physicists

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:23.080
have gone wild and

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.080
have connections in the world that

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.080
you can not check and that

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.080
you can never prove and then

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.080
postulate all these additional paths,

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.080
but that there is simply no possibility

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:35.080
to determine a priori

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:37.080
that there is only one path.

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:39.080
And that in the basic reality it is probably not

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:41.080
possible that there is only one path,

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.080
because there is simply nothing that

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.080
there is only one path.

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.080
I used this thing

01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:49.080
where you use all operators on all operators

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:51.080
to discuss with students

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.080
who told me, yes, Wolfram

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.080
just wrote an article

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.080
about it, he has the same idea.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:59.080
And then I read it and

01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.080
realized, yes, that looks like the same idea.

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:03.080
I also tried to understand

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.080
myself with him.

01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:07.080
In the time when I worked at

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.080
Interlabs, I held

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:11.080
a number of panel discussions with

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:13.080
people that I found interesting,

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.080
which I then invited to discuss

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.080
topics with us that interested us.

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.080
And Steven Wolfram kindly

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.080
agreed to it.

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.080
And I tried to ask him

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.080
questions about the boundaries of the role.

01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.080
But unfortunately

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:29.080
he was not ready at the points

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:31.080
where we did not know the answers

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.080
to discuss further.

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:35.080
I think he had to figure it out for himself first.

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.080
If everything

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.080
that is possible is simply the case,

01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:41.080
because if you do not have any

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:43.080
prior, no bid

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.080
to specify that

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.080
the possible is not there,

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.080
then people think very quickly, okay, then

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.080
everything I can imagine is going to happen somewhere.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:53.080
And then we asked ourselves if it was the same as the cover.

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:55.080
Because everything that is possible means

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:57.080
that if you apply all operators

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.080
that all structures that arise from it

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:01.080
are the possible structures. But it can be very likely

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:03.080
that you can imagine something incomplete,

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:05.080
I don't know, if the unicorn

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.080
flies through or something,

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:09.080
which is still not realized.

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.080
And I think that would be the difference to this multiversum,

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.080
where then suddenly everything that is imaginable

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:15.080
has to exist, because there is everything,

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.080
versus, well, everything that

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:19.080
arises from the repeated application of one operator

01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:21.080
on all rules is then there.

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.080
But do you know the difference?

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:25.080
Yes, of course, the thing is

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:27.080
the Boltzmann universe, so to speak,

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.080
the global state of the universe

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.080
goes into another global state

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:33.080
that is not correlated with the previous one.

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.080
Yes, it is possible,

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:37.080
but extremely unlikely,

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.080
because it is an extremely complex

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.080
operator, which is therefore

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:43.080
very rare. And that means

01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:45.080
the probability that you are currently

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.080
in the Boltzmann state is extremely

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.080
low, because normally

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.080
structured structures in the

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.080
Boltzmann universe do not arise.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.080
And that means that the

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.080
probability that you are practically in a sequential

01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.080
or operator sequence

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.080
is much, much greater, because there are much more

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.080
possibilities, more paths on which

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:05.080
a universe that looks like ours

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.080
arises. That means you can't exactly

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:09.080
know where you are in this big fractal,

01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.080
that you create by the rules, that you just

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:13.080
generate everything from one, all the time

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:15.080
with all possibilities.

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:17.080
It is the probability that you are

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:19.080
in the thing that is created

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:21.080
by the sequential operator application

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.080
of simple operators

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.080
is astronomically larger.

01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:27.080
So the Boltzmann

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.080
brain requires a maximum complex

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.080
operator, in which you transfer the whole

01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:33.080
universe in one step

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.080
into a state that is not correlated.

01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.080
And again,

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.080
I want to break it down a bit

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:43.080
again, but on one example.

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.080
In the multiverse, one would think,

01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:47.080
there is now also a universe

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.080
in which my hand is somehow

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.080
just above my head.

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:53.080
And in fact you don't know if

01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:55.080
that is possible. You don't know if

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.080
through the repeated applications of one operator

01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:59.080
somewhere

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.080
such a branch ends in the situation

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:03.080
that I raise my arm.

01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:05.080
So I don't do it on purpose so that we

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:07.080
can continue to doubt whether it is possible.

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.080
But with the normal, what I meant,

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:11.080
multiversum theories, they would say

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:13.080
that everything is there,

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.080
what is possible. So do you know a little

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:17.080
what I mean? I know what you mean.

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:19.080
You just answered and maybe I didn't

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.080
really understand it, but...

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.080
Yes, the thing is that it is not clear

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.080
how we should prove

01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:27.080
that we come to a universe through the simple

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.080
application of operators

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.080
that looks so macroscopically similar to us

01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:33.080
and would be allowed,

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.080
but possibly does not work

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.080
microscopically. Exactly, okay.

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:39.080
So it could just be that many imaginable things

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:41.080
are not possible

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:43.080
in the real world. They are

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.080
still there. Even if we

01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.080
think, yes, if we could

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:49.080
imagine it, of course the imagination is not complete

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.080
and it is not implemented in the imagination,

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:53.080
then it would still be possible. We had

01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.080
questions yesterday. Did I

01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:57.080
satisfy what you asked?

01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.080
Yes.

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.080
Yes.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.080
That is also a bit Wolfram's idea

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:05.080
that through the application of all operators

01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:07.080
still something specific happens

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.080
and not somehow,

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:11.080
so everything happens, but that the roulette

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.080
still somehow has a structure or something.

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.080
Everything is possible, it is something specific

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.080
in the end. Yes.

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:19.080
Yes. Exactly, but it is something

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:21.080
not, so to speak, one percent homogeneous

01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.080
or something like that, which always looks exactly

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:25.080
the same in every direction and so on.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.080
You could somehow think that.

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:29.080
And that means,

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:31.080
but if we now express ourselves in this

01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:33.080
classical language of philosophy,

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.080
then there is something

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:37.080
that we, well, then there is a difference

01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:39.080
between what is possible

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.080
and what we can imagine.

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.080
You could say,

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.080
for example, that somehow God's face

01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:47.080
appears in the clouds there or

01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:49.080
the unicorn flies through here or something like that.

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.080
We can imagine that, but we can

01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:53.080
perhaps not imagine

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:55.080
that with the complete

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:57.080
causality catch up to the beginning.

01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:59.080
And that's why we don't know

01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:01.080
whether it is actually a possibility,

01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.080
even if it is a possible possibility.

01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.080
Yes, that means

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.080
if we say imaginable,

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.080
then we have to make it clear that our

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:11.080
representations are very fluid.

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:13.080
We can imagine

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.080
that we are millionaires,

01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:17.080
but the problem is to get the causal chain

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:19.080
that leads us to become millionaires

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.080
is very complex.

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:23.080
That means,

01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:25.080
to trigger the control process

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:27.080
that leads to a representation

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.080
being justified,

01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.080
is the problem.

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.080
And the control processes are ultimately

01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.080
on the lowest level of causality

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.080
of the universe and then swing up.

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:39.080
And a control process means,

01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:41.080
it's a term from the theory of regulation,

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.080
from the humanistic theory,

01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:45.080
that you have a system that

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.080
stabilizes its own structure,

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.080
that can be described as if it were to do so.

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:51.080
And that means that as soon as

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:53.080
it runs out of certain parameters,

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.080
a counter-force appears that leads

01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.080
to push it back into these parameters.

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.080
And in the case of the

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.080
whirl on the surface of the water,

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.080
it is as simple as possible.

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:05.080
Because with the whirl in the surface of the water,

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:07.080
you move your hand at the beginning

01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:09.080
and all vectors arise in the water molecules.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:11.080
And most of these lead

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.080
to the fact that the information

01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:15.080
that is created by the whirl

01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:17.080
is no longer recognizable.

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.080
After a short time, the waves scatter

01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:21.080
and only a very small part of this information

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.080
leads to the stable whirl structure.

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:25.080
The rest

01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.080
simply dissipates out.

01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.080
It simply evaporates.

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:31.080
It evaporates into the background.

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:33.080
And only the part that, so to speak,

01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.080
selects itself for it,

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:37.080
by having the exact right vector

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.080
to keep itself in this circle, stays there.

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:41.080
And at the next higher level,

01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.080
these systems can interact with each other.

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:45.080
And they form stable systems

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.080
that you can squish a little.

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:49.080
And they come back

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.080
to their starting point.

01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:53.080
This ideal whirl, as soon as you squish it,

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.080
it dissolves.

01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.080
But in the whirl

01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.080
that you see in the surface of the water,

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.080
it is already a bit more stable.

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.080
For example, the surface of the water has viscosity.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:05.080
That means the molecules

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:07.080
target the surface of the water

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:09.080
in a certain way, so that it tries

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.080
to stay stable, but is also stretchable.

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.080
And that means that the thing already has a certain

02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.080
robustness when you push against it

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:17.080
and cause disturbance,

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:19.080
so that it moves back to its original form

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:21.080
and is elastic.

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:23.080
Or imagine a soap bubble.

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.080
A soap bubble is such a thing

02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:27.080
where you have a structure

02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:29.080
in 3D

02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:31.080
that balances several

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.080
criteria against each other,

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:35.080
namely the surface tension of the fluid

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.080
that forms the border of the soap bubble

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:39.080
and the pressure of the air inside.

02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.080
And the two of them push against each other

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.080
so strongly that a stable structure

02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.080
exists that can withstand many disturbances.

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:47.080
Or imagine

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:49.080
a water molecule

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.080
in which you have

02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:53.080
two hydrogen atoms

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.080
and a oxygen atom.

02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:57.080
And they are bound together

02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:59.080
by the actinomatism

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.080
that arises in the atom shells

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:03.080
and leads to electron pairs.

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.080
You can squish the thing

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:07.080
to a certain extent

02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:09.080
and it comes back to its original state.

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:11.080
And the things that are stable

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.080
over a wide range of squishings

02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:15.080
are the periodic table of elements.

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:17.080
And those that are not, are things

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.080
that fall apart relatively quickly.

02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.080
Or fall apart immediately.

02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.080
And the rare elements are the ones

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.080
that fall apart very quickly

02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:27.080
under the conditions in which they exist.

02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.080
That is, they do not stay stable for long,

02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:31.080
but fall apart when there are small disturbances.

02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:33.080
But the interesting thing about them

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.080
is that the disturbances

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.080
are always regulated instantly.

02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:39.080
So similar to the thermostat.

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.080
The thermostat is a controller

02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:43.080
that only measures the current

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.080
and only regulates in the current.

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.080
And the really interesting control systems

02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.080
are the ones that regulate the future.

02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.080
So they are prepared

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.080
for a number of possible disturbances

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:55.080
in the future and are able

02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:57.080
to intervene on future disturbances

02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:59.080
in such a way that they now

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.080
lead the appropriate future.

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.080
We call them agents.

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.080
An agent is a controller

02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.080
for future conditions.

02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.080
And then it turns out that the easiest

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.080
agents that we can see in nature,

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:13.080
which at least I can see, are cells.

02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:15.080
It is a kind of super molecule

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:17.080
that I can keep stable

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.080
over many, many types of environmental conditions

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.080
so that it can predict the future.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.080
And the cell is a totally fascinating system.

02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:25.080
It consists on the one hand

02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:27.080
of a self-replicator

02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.080
and on the other hand of a Turing machine.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.080
The Turing machine has a typewriter,

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.080
the reprisome,

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.080
and the DNA.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.080
And all of these are small tapes

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.080
that spin around additionally.

02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:41.080
And then there is a neck entropy extractor,

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.080
a system that is able

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:45.080
to become stable against disturbances

02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:47.080
by spilling these disturbances

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:49.080
out of the system.

02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:51.080
And the structures on which

02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:53.080
these disturbances are written,

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.080
such as molecules that move quickly

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.080
and are warm, are spilt out of the cell

02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.080
that you collect,

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:01.080
do not have this information that disturbs you.

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:03.080
In order to be stable,

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.080
an agent has to be able to forget

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.080
the disturbances that are added to him.

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.080
Otherwise, the knowledge about these disturbances

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:11.080
accumulates in the information collection.

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:15.080
And in order to achieve this,

02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.080
you have to, so to speak,

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.080
clean yourself all the time.

02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.080
And if you do something clean,

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.080
something else becomes dirty.

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.080
And what becomes dirty, you have to push out of yourself.

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:27.080
We all live on Earth in a way

02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.080
that it encodes disturbances

02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.080
into particles,

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.080
mostly as speed differences

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:35.080
in particles.

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:37.080
And this statistic of speed differences

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.080
in particles is called heat.

02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:41.080
And it is then radiated

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.080
into the deep space.

02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.080
This is the sink for the whole entropy.

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.080
And we fill up these particles

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.080
by collecting fresh photons

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:51.080
that are nicely sorted from the sun.

02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:53.080
And the sun is, so to speak,

02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:55.080
a neck entropy of order

02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:57.080
that we convert into disorder.

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.080
And we, as organisms,

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.080
exist as pumps

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.080
from order to disorder.

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.080
This allows us to maintain

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:07.080
our structure

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.080
and by building more and more structures,

02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:11.080
building more and more complexity,

02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:13.080
we are able to convert more and more

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.080
of this neck entropy

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.080
into disorder.

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.080
You just presented

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:23.080
a fascinating model

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:25.080
with which one can build

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.080
a foundation for the four core questions

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.080
of philosophy.

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:31.080
And you also said

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.080
that you are not the first

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.080
to do this.

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:37.080
But why have so few people

02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:39.080
accepted this so far?

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.080
In physics, in philosophy,

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.080
also in mathematics.

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.080
Of course, I could say that many people

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.080
in computer science have accepted this.

02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:49.080
You just talked about

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.080
Paul Bauer,

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.080
who has already tried

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.080
to lead this struggle

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.080
in the academy, so to speak.

02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:59.080
And I think,

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:01.080
yes, exactly,

02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:03.080
Wildberger does it too.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:05.080
And I don't know, probably Ed Friedkin

02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:07.080
did it. And there are some people

02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.080
who have tried it.

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:11.080
And the best explanation

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:13.080
that I've heard so far

02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:15.080
why they don't accept it

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:17.080
– well, I know a little bit

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:19.080
about mathematics – is because

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:21.080
the proofs are simply so inelegant.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.080
That means,

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.080
if I now

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.080
do a constructive or

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:29.080
an intuitionist mathematics,

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.080
then I just need for some proofs

02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:33.080
so much longer.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:35.080
Before that, I could just say, yes,

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:37.080
assuming that it is not so

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:39.080
contradictory, done,

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.080
super fast,

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:43.080
not followed by P,

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.080
and that went

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:47.080
on for half a page. And if I

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:49.080
want to do this constructively,

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.080
then I might need ten pages

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:53.080
or so for it. That means, I think,

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:55.080
why mathematicians don't accept it

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.080
is because they first think,

02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:59.080
yes, it works, what we do.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:01.080
We don't have any problems. Why should we change anything?

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:03.080
That you can't

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.080
put it in a computer.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:07.080
The pure mathematicians are not really interested in that.

02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:09.080
And they find it somehow

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:11.080
inelegant. Do you think

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.080
that's an argument? Can you understand that?

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.080
Do you think,

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.080
while doing that,

02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.080
do you have an idea

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:21.080
if there are people who try it?

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:23.080
I have recently read a little introduction

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.080
to constructive analysis.

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:27.080
I think it was from 1967 or so.

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:29.080
And then

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.080
the introduction was like, yes, and I'm sure

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.080
that in the end we will be kept right.

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.080
And not,

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.080
it won't take too long.

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:39.080
Now it's 50 years

02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.080
or even longer, and nothing has

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:43.080
been done.

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.080
Do you see a way?

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:47.080
I have the impression that something is already happening.

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.080
Just like in philosophy

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.080
something is happening. It's just

02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.080
that the rest doesn't go away.

02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:55.080
And what very rarely

02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.080
happens in science is that a group

02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:59.080
of people who have built

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:01.080
a tradition for a long time

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.080
looks at themselves

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.080
and says, okay,

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:07.080
we're giving it up now, or we're done now.

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.080
But in the end

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:11.080
these currents are all self-contained

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:13.080
if there are enough time spaces

02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:15.080
over time.

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.080
And the other problem is that so and so much

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.080
fits into the human mind over the lifetime.

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.080
I met

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.080
Sam Adams, a computer scientist,

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:25.080
an AI researcher.

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:27.080
I went to a conference.

02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:29.080
He worked at IBM for many years

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:31.080
and said he had a very

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:33.080
vague feeling when he went to an AI

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.080
conference with me,

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.080
because he had the impression that he

02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:39.080
had been out of the current

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:41.080
business for 20 years,

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.080
in the artificial intelligence

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.080
and that he was probably completely

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:47.080
detached. He had continued

02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:49.080
building his own things all the time,

02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:51.080
but maybe since Minsky and so on

02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.080
what he read and thought back then

02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:55.080
is already so much further

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:57.080
and the new generation

02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.080
has gone far away from him.

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:01.080
And after we left the conference

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:03.080
and went home, he said, we have to hurry.

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.080
I mean, I'm old now, but if we can't do it,

02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:07.080
this generation can't do it,

02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:09.080
because they know less than we do.

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:13.080
And this thing that you

02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.080
realize at some point, when I was young,

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.080
I had the impression that a lot

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.080
happened in cognitive science, that there was

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:21.080
an extremely high frequency with which

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:23.080
you had groundbreaking new insights

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.080
that came in that changed everything.

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:27.080
And now I have the impression

02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:29.080
that every generation still has to

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:31.080
make all the mistakes of the previous generation

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.080
again, because you can

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:35.080
make things so difficult for yourself.

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:37.080
And finally, to make progress,

02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:39.080
you as an individual

02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:41.080
have to dig yourself down a little bit

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.080
from the basics and then come back

02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.080
to the limit and rebuild something at the limit.

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:47.080
And this process takes so long

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.080
that there is not always a shortcut.

02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:51.080
And you can't

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.080
rely on others

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:55.080
because there are so many schools

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.080
that don't have a clear picture

02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.080
of their basics, or there are individuals

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:01.080
that don't have a clear picture of their basics.

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:03.080
And in computer science and mathematics

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.080
it is even easier.

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.080
In other sciences it is much more difficult.

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:09.080
So, in short,

02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:11.080
the reason why

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:13.080
there is no agreement about it,

02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.080
not even in mathematics itself,

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.080
but also not about the different

02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:19.080
branches of philosophy or

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:21.080
of science or of social

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.080
flow that you try to recognize,

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:25.080
is the Tower of Babel.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:27.080
The Tower of Babel is the idea that

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:29.080
we are able to build

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.080
the only building

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:33.080
that conquers the entire sky.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.080
And the meaning of Heavens

02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:37.080
back then was different

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:39.080
than what we understood later.

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.080
Today we translate Heavens

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:43.080
as an imaginary place that exists

02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:45.080
in a superstitious way

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:47.080
and in which non-existent

02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:49.080
supernatural agents stay.

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:51.080
God and angels and

02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.080
the souls of the dead

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.080
or whatever.

02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:57.080
And I think that this is a

02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:59.080
very important point.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:01.080
Also a part of the Tower of Babel.

02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.080
Where Heaven and Earth

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.080
first appear is in Genesis

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.080
and it describes

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.080
that consciousness

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.080
is hanging over the substrate

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.080
and I think that happens

02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:15.080
in every single one of us.

02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.080
And the border in the substrate

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:19.080
is between the world model and the idea sphere.

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:21.080
And we realize that

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.080
in our mind there is a world model

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.080
that is what we perceive as stuff in space

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:27.080
not in the physical sense

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:29.080
but in the sense where we see people

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:31.080
with geometry and colors and ideas

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.080
and thoughts that touch things.

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:35.080
This stuff in space is a game engine

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.080
that our brain generates.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:39.080
And this is a very special kind of mental state

02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:41.080
mental state

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:43.080
because it is correlated to our perception.

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.080
That means we are in resonance

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.080
with the world around us

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:49.080
through our nervous system

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.080
that is coupled with the world

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:53.080
and we build this world model

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.080
and the processes around us are tracked.

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:57.080
This world model is stuff in space.

02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:59.080
And in the text of Genesis 1

02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:01.080
they call it Earth

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.080
or world.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.080
And the world is simply the world model.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.080
Rest extensa

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.080
in the Dekarczian sense

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.080
is not the physics

02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.080
but it is a mental state

02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.080
that describes the world model.

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.080
And everything else

02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.080
that we have in our mind

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.080
that is not the world model

02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:23.080
these are the heavens, the idea spheres

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:25.080
the space in which we have thoughts

02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:27.080
about the world that are temporarily

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.080
decoupled and can also be

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.080
semantically decoupled from our perception.

02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.080
And in fact there are these two areas

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.080
in our spirit and in every spirit

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:37.080
that we know.

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.080
So every human and most complicated

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.080
animals have a world model

02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.080
and a space of ideas

02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:45.080
that cannot be directly reflected

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:47.080
on perception in the outer environment

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:49.080
or the proprioception.

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:51.080
And if we now go back

02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.080
and think about what is heaven

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.080
that is simply the idea sphere

02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.080
the noosphere.

02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:59.080
And to bring the idea into this space

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.080
is the project of the tower

02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:03.080
to Babel in this myth.

02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:05.080
And this project failed

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:07.080
because the people

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.080
did not manage to find a common language

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:11.080
that remained coherent.

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:13.080
The more people worked on it

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.080
the more special the languages were

02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:17.080
and the more difficult they were to translate.

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.080
And that is why the tower fell apart.

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:21.080
So the whole tower broke apart.

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:23.080
God guided her somehow

02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.080
or gave her the language

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.080
that she could no longer understand.

02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.080
He somehow found the project dangerous.

02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:31.080
How is that?

02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.080
It can be.

02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:35.080
But logically it is the case that

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.080
the churches have the impression

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.080
that the rationalists are trying

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:41.080
to explain the world and forget God

02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:43.080
and can no longer explain

02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.080
and therefore cannot

02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.080
underline the world.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.080
And if we take our original definition

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.080
of God from earlier

02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:53.080
from this afternoon

02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:55.080
then it was the small written God

02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:57.080
the general gods

02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:59.080
are simply themselves

02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:01.080
that surround different spirits

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:03.080
and the big written God

02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:05.080
is the total God

02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:07.080
the greatest, best God

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:09.080
that we can construct.

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:11.080
And if we build a civilization

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.080
like ours, then it works by doing

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:15.080
even if no one is watching.

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:17.080
That is, the agent that we build together

02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:19.080
the system of agency

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:21.080
that we create together

02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:23.080
the system in which we control the future together

02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:25.080
in the most harmonious possible way

02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.080
that is God.

02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:29.080
God is created by the fact that we recognize

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:31.080
that it makes sense to seek harmony

02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:33.080
that we make our behavior

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.080
so coherent with each other

02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:37.080
as we make our behavior so coherent

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.080
in our own spirit

02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:41.080
that our hands do something together

02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:43.080
In a way, a society should ideally work

02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.080
in such a way that the individuals

02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:47.080
do not work against each other

02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:49.080
but are coherent.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:51.080
But they are not coherent to do something similar

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.080
but coherent according to the best possible

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:55.080
set of structural principles

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:57.080
that can be discovered.

02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:59.080
And that is what the churches

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:01.080
try to stabilize.

02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:03.080
That is, they try to practically synchronize

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.080
the gods with the people

02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:07.080
so that at the end a civilization is created

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:09.080
that is harmonious

02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:11.080
and that the best possible survival

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.080
and the longest possible survival is possible for us.

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:15.080
That is the idea behind it.

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:17.080
And the scientists often do not recognize that.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.080
And possibly the message

02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:21.080
why the story of the tower of Babel

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.080
is told like that

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:25.080
it is not only told as an observation

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.080
but as a normative

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:29.080
there is a message in it that God wants to send to the people

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.080
is that if you believe too much

02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.080
in what you do in your private languages

02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:35.080
then at the end there is no coherent system

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:37.080
that breaks together in your civilization.

02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.080
The interpretation is that

02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.080
I do not agree with the text.

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:45.080
The thing is that there are computational languages

02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.080
that did not discover them back then.

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:49.080
They did not discover the theory of the Church

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:51.080
they did not discover that they are all equally powerful.

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:53.080
And today we find that out.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.080
We find out why it is possible

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.080
that our own spirit agrees with itself on a language

02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:59.080
and how it would be conceivable

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:01.080
that one finds a harmonization

02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:03.080
over all possible spirits

02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:05.080
who are able to think so far

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:07.080
that they can shape the foundations of their own thinking

02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:09.080
in the space of all metaphysics

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.080
and find out which metaphysics

02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:13.080
can work

02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:15.080
build a metametaphysics

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.080
from which one can derive all possible world models

02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:19.080
which are coherent in themselves

02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:21.080
and translate them into human beings.

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:25.080
A short question, how is it with the light?

02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:27.080
It glows interesting

02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.080
but it is not a big problem

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.080
because in front of me there are various microphones

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:33.080
that I can use in between.

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.080
How does it look on the camera?

02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.080
We can also do it like this

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:39.080
that we turn the table

02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:41.080
with 90 degrees

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:43.080
then the sun comes from the side.

02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.080
This meme is for me

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:47.080
a strange thing

02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:49.080
when you express it here and say

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.080
Franz that you want to hang it on the kitchen wall.

02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:53.080
For me it was more of a fleeting thing

02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:55.080
that you quickly

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.080
produce within a few minutes.

02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.080
But it is a bit like that from the ...

02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:01.080
That's why I think it's so good

02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:03.080
because these are memes.

02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:05.080
It is this fleeting meme-like

02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.080
but there is so beautiful

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.080
idea space in it

02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:11.080
and this combination makes it

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:13.080
my favorite meme so far.

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.080
The thing is that you ...

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.080
The memes work because

02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:19.080
they capture something so quickly

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.080
but what they capture is sometimes quite complex.

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:23.080
For me the meme is a bit like

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:25.080
the famous Chinese painter

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.080
who is commissioned by the king

02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:29.080
to paint birds

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:31.080
and he

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:33.080
sits there all the time

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:35.080
and sketches and throws away

02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:37.080
and sketches and throws away and so on and so forth

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:39.080
and then the king comes to him and says to him

02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.080
where is the bird that you should paint for me?

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.080
And the artist

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.080
sits down, takes a fresh sheet of paper

02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:47.080
takes his brush and makes

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:49.080
a complex stroke and has the bird.

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:51.080
And the king is super

02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:53.080
disappointed and says

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.080
why? You just did it so quickly.

02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:57.080
What is the thing?

02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:59.080
And he says, no, to make it

02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:01.080
I had to become the one who can do it all.

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:03.080
And for me it is also like that.

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:05.080
For me it is the result of

02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:07.080
thinking about all the stuff for several decades

02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.080
and then trying to draw my own path

02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:11.080
and to think about

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:13.080
which steps I have come up with.

02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:15.080
And of course it is not the only

02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:17.080
possible path and probably

02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:19.080
not the end of the path because many details are missing.

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:21.080
But it is interesting to

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.080
get to know yourself.

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:25.080
And the great thing about this medium Twitter

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:27.080
is that you ...

02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:29.080
that there are so many people on it

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:31.080
that you can develop very special thoughts.

02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:33.080
And then when you

02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:35.080
train your followers accordingly

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:37.080
so that they are able to get along with it

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:39.080
you just have among your

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:41.080
tens of thousands of followers always some

02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:43.080
who can get along with your thoughts and who can interface

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.080
and can bring you further into the discussion.

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:49.080
And here you also have to shout out

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:51.080
to the expanding brain thing itself

02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:53.080
because it really fits on it

02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:55.080
so I sometimes still get such jitters

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:57.080
when I only concentrate on the pictures

02:17:57.080 --> 02:17:59.080
together with what is there

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:01.080
and then it's always ...

02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:03.080
well.

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:05.080
Yes, it was just such a spiritual ...

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.080
it fits together so well that I quickly tap it down

02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:09.080
and put it on Twitter.

02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:13.080
It is also interesting because for me I would say

02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:15.080
if I had to think about

02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:17.080
what my intellectual

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:19.080
trajectory has most influenced

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:21.080
then it was probably

02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:23.080
this nerd Twitter bubble

02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:25.080
and for most people

02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:27.080
Twitter is not the place

02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:29.080
where you think you can find knowledge

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:31.080
because at the same time so many nerdy things happen

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:33.080
but also so beautiful.

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:35.080
Sure, as soon as I get out of my filter bubble

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.080
it gets uncomfortable.

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.080
Some people think that filter bubble is something totally bad

02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:41.080
but filter bubble is the equivalent

02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:43.080
of a room in which you

02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:45.080
can play a concert, for example.

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:47.080
Another is a box match, another is a kindergarten

02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:49.080
and another is a

02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:51.080
theater play and they can all

02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:53.080
only work because they are separated

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.080
and because they can separate

02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:57.080
for the duration of the performance.

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.080
We wrote a few more comments about this meme

02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:03.080
which was also

02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:05.080
part of the experience

02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:07.080
when the meme was aired on Twitter.

02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:11.080
One comment below was

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.080
there is no independent truth

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.080
then you answered welcome to level 2

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.080
and the person answered with a smiley

02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:19.080
got me.

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.080
Very nice interaction.

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:23.080
At level 1 you think

02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:25.080
that logic is absolute

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.080
and at level 2 you can see

02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:29.080
that the logic depends on

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:31.080
the definition in the action system.

02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:33.080
We have not yet come to the point

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:35.080
where we can have any action system

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:37.080
which is not available

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:39.080
so it is only level 2.

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:43.080
What did you answer with level 3?

02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:47.080
What is that?

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:51.080
What is the definition in a formal language?

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:53.080
It can be defined in any way we want.

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:15.080
What if the universe contains

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:17.080
non-computable processes?

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.080
Computation with general

02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:21.080
real-valued variables?

02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:23.080
Level 3.

02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:25.080
At this point we have not

02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:27.080
taken the step to constructive mathematics

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:29.080
and believe that

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:31.080
languages that are not implementable

02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:33.080
are suitable to

02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:35.080
describe truth in such a way

02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:37.080
that you can claim that all these things exist.

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:39.080
Truth

02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:41.080
that can work with it

02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:43.080
must exist in the form

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:45.080
that is, it must be implementable

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:47.080
that is, it is pre-computationalist.

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:09.080
Exactly, it is the case that

02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:11.080
he took the kettlebell

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:13.080
but he has not yet come out

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:15.080
and has understood the consequence.

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:17.080
That is, he is exactly at the point

02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:19.080
where he sees that these languages

02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:21.080
that he uses to describe reality

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:23.080
are running in boundaries

02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:25.080
because they run in self-contradictions

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:27.080
and that means that the reality he builds with

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.080
does not end and he does not see the way out of it.

02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:45.080
Universe is a computer

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:47.080
but that we can build universal computers

02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.080
capable of simulating any physical system.

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:51.080
Thoughts?

02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.080
Level 4.

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:15.080
That he has not yet taken the step

02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:17.080
to recognize that

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:19.080
the pre-computational languages

02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:21.080
are running in contradictions.

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:23.080
The thing is, when we accept

02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:25.080
that nothing can be thought of

02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:27.080
that is not computational

02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:29.080
and nothing can be observed

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:31.080
then we can not even

02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:33.080
refer to this universe

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:35.080
in our thoughts.

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:37.080
Of course, every system

02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:39.080
in which we speak about something

02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:41.080
can only refer to the system itself.

02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:43.080
If we have a representation system

02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:45.080
in which we can talk about the universe

02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:47.080
and think about it

02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:49.080
then we can only talk and think about

02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.080
universes that can be reproduced

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:53.080
in the representation system.

02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:55.080
And to claim that they can exist

02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.080
does not make sense

02:22:57.080 --> 02:22:59.080
because every alternative to the system

02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:01.080
leads to contradictions.

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:03.080
That is, the systems that we can think about

02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:05.080
and that we can claim

02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:07.080
that it is a universe

02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:09.080
must be in the class of systems

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:11.080
that can be described in languages

02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:13.080
that are not self-contradictory

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:15.080
because the others are not existent.

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:17.080
And also not thinkable in that sense.

02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:19.080
Yes, that's what it means.

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:21.080
We can not think about it

02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:23.080
in such a way that our language does not break.

02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:25.080
And I think that's the big thing

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:27.080
that still confuses people

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.080
even further.

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:31.080
That they somehow think, well,

02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:33.080
it could be that it is continuous

02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:35.080
and they still do not notice

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:37.080
that the idea of continuous

02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:39.080
has the same meaning

02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:41.080
as a direct contradiction at the end.

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:43.080
Yes, but each of these ideas has confused me

02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:45.080
for a long time.

02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:47.080
For me it is really a progression

02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:49.080
that I have made myself

02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:51.080
because I had to find out why it is so and so.

02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:53.080
And I did not have the feeling

02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:55.080
that someone helped me, but on the contrary.

02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:57.080
I tried to get it out

02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:59.080
against the institutions

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:01.080
that explained to me that they are the axioms

02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:03.080
and I realize, no,

02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:05.080
your identity concept is not mine

02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:07.080
because it does not work that way

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.080
when I try to think.

02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.080
This is a complicated question.

02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:31.080
The thing is that on the lowest level

02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:33.080
where we do not need a memory,

02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:35.080
so to speak, and the universe

02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:37.080
only exists as a condition

02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:39.080
in the space of the possible,

02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:41.080
the question is, is there

02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:43.080
a limitation?

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:45.080
So is the possible

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:47.080
limited by something?

02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:49.080
Or if there is boundlessness

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.080
on the lowest level of the possibility,

02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:53.080
then of course it leads

02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:55.080
to an infinity.

02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:57.080
It is just that the operators

02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:59.080
who work on it

02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:01.080
usually cannot lead to structures

02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:03.080
that inevitably integrate many elements

02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:05.080
from one step to the next.

02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:07.080
And that means

02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:09.080
that there is a limit

02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:11.080
where the question for me

02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:13.080
is not clear and I suspect

02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:15.080
that the unboundedness

02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:17.080
on the lowest level, because we do not

02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:19.080
need a memory and no sequential

02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.080
addition of operations,

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:23.080
theoretically could lead to an infinity.

02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:25.080
But it is not

02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:27.080
a constructive infinity.

02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:29.080
That is, wherever we accept that the universe

02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:31.080
is constructive, where we describe things

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.080
as transitions through other things

02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:35.080
and the world in which

02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.080
we have, for example, information

02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.080
and structure formation,

02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:41.080
wherever information and structure

02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:43.080
formation play a role, it probably

02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:45.080
cannot work.

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:47.080
And that is something where I

02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:49.080
do not see the clear proof. I have the impression

02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:51.080
that I see it, but I cannot

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:53.080
write it down formally. That is why

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:55.080
it is so that I hallucinate it.

02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:57.080
But then I have another question, if you

02:25:57.080 --> 02:25:59.080
talk about the lowest possible level

02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:01.080
where the unboundedness becomes a real infinity,

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:03.080
then we get the same

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:05.080
problems, or that you

02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:07.080
simply cannot keep the concept infinity

02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:09.080
up at all, because if you look closely,

02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:11.080
it is exactly the same.

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:13.080
It is above all the next

02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:15.080
problem is that I cannot talk about it,

02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.080
that is, I cannot think about it. And since I

02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:19.080
cannot think about it, it cannot

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.080
be claimed in any way

02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:23.080
that we are in it.

02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:25.080
Because I cannot refer to the thing where

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.080
we are supposed to be in it.

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.080
I always imagine that when I have

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:31.080
continual ideas about

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.080
the universe, or space, or time,

02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:35.080
I simply replace it with

02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:37.080
x and not x. And then I say

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:39.080
that what I am currently thinking

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:41.080
about has exactly the same

02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.080
meaning as this. It is simply

02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:45.080
another token for contradiction.

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:47.080
And that is it.

02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:49.080
But that is something where I say,

02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:51.080
as far as I understand it logically,

02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:53.080
there is no possibility that we are in

02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:55.080
the universe. But it is also the case

02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:57.080
that when I go through my one progression,

02:26:57.080 --> 02:26:59.080
through these steps, it was often the case

02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:01.080
that I am at a point where I say

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:03.080
I cannot logically understand why

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:05.080
there is something, instead of something else.

02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:07.080
This question seems, in principle,

02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:09.080
unanswerable.

02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:11.080
And that confused me, because I thought

02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:13.080
how can it be that there are questions that

02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:15.080
are unanswered, because you can always find a curve.

02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.080
And at some point you

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.080
realize, oh, there is this

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:21.080
solution. But that also shows

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:23.080
how fragile our own thinking is

02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:25.080
and how unreliable it is.

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:27.080
And in the end, unfortunately,

02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:29.080
that is something that we have to leave to the machines.

02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:35.080
I wanted to read a quote from Einstein

02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:37.080
where I wonder

02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:39.080
if he describes

02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.080
similar problems.

02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:43.080
I had that in a planning concept, but I don't know

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:45.080
if you read it in such detail.

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:47.080
Einstein on the discreteness of space-time.

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:49.080
But you have correctly

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:51.080
grasped

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:53.080
the drawback

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:55.080
that the continuum brings.

02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:57.080
If the molecular view of

02:27:57.080 --> 02:27:59.080
matter is the correct

02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.080
and appropriate one, that is,

02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:03.080
if a part of the universe

02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:05.080
is to be represented by a finite number

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:07.080
of moving points,

02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:09.080
then the continuum

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.080
of the present theory contains

02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:13.080
too great a manifold of possibilities.

02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:15.080
I also believe

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.080
that this too great

02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:19.080
is responsible for the fact

02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:21.080
that our present means of description

02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:23.080
miscarry with the quantum theory.

02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:25.080
The problem seems to me

02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:27.080
how one can formulate statements

02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:29.080
about a discontinuum

02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:31.080
without calling

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:33.080
upon a continuum

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:35.080
as an aid.

02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:37.080
The letter, the continuum,

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:39.080
should be banned from the theory

02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:41.080
as a supplementary construction

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:43.080
not justified by the essence

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.080
of the problem, which corresponds

02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:47.080
to nothing real.

02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:49.080
But we still lack

02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:51.080
the mathematical structure, unfortunately.

02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:53.080
How much have I already

02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:55.080
plagued myself in this way?

02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:17.080
The idea that one

02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:19.080
can assemble the universe

02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:21.080
from discrete units,

02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:23.080
but the idea that one

02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:25.080
derives geometry from discrete

02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:27.080
operations, from quantum theory

02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:29.080
and so on and so forth,

02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:31.080
he probably didn't have any tools for that.

02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:33.080
And even now it's problematic.

02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:35.080
Wolfram tries to do that,

02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:37.080
but it's not trivial.

02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:39.080
I don't know how much mathematics

02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:41.080
is in this area, but Einstein

02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:43.080
has seen this possibility.

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:45.080
He has been confronted with the fact

02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:47.080
that there are singularities in space-time.

02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:49.080
And singularities

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:51.080
are nothing positive.

02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:53.080
That is, that the mathematical description

02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:55.080
no longer works, that you

02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:57.080
practically get a division by zero

02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:59.080
and the value is no longer valid

02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:01.080
that you get.

02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:03.080
So singularity means

02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:05.080
that practically the dimensions

02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:07.080
in which a model is described

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:09.080
are not sufficient to

02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.080
grasp the dynamics of the model.

02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:13.080
And he then noticed

02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:15.080
that one can push the singularities

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:17.080
in space-time around,

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:19.080
i.e. these places where space-time

02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:21.080
breaks down and then practically push them

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.080
into the middle of masses.

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:25.080
And that means that in the middle of masses

02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:27.080
there is a point where space-time

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:29.080
no longer really works, but maybe

02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:31.080
it's not that bad, maybe it has to do with

02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:33.080
how space-time is knotted in a certain way

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:35.080
and runs out of the rudder.

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:37.080
But he was confronted with it relatively early

02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:39.080
that the possibility exists that

02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:41.080
the space-time description that he makes,

02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:43.080
i.e. the continuous geometric space-time

02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:45.080
is not suitable to describe the absolute

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:47.080
basics of physics.

02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:49.080
And the other thing is this confrontation

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:51.080
with the quantization of the universe

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:53.080
that he saw relatively early.

02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:55.080
Einstein was a very broad thinker

02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:57.080
who did not focus on a certain idea

02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.080
because he knew

02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:01.080
how he made his ideas.

02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:03.080
He was not a member, he was not a type

02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:05.080
whose theories came about

02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:07.080
that he took over from other teachers

02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:09.080
that he did not modify easily.

02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:11.080
Instead, he is someone who has invented

02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:13.080
these ideas all by himself and together with

02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:15.080
other people who have also invented ideas

02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:17.080
that were discussed about it.

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.080
That is, it is a completely different approach

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:21.080
than what scientists experience today

02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:23.080
who practically think about subpar themes.

02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:25.080
That is, they marry into a school from the beginning

02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:27.080
and try to take over the concepts

02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:29.080
and try to understand as well as possible,

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:31.080
to make them fit and then add an epsilon.

02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:33.080
So since it was clear to him

02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:35.080
that he had invented this continuous space-time

02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:37.080
to describe the world,

02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:39.080
that it was a good formalism,

02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:41.080
it is also clear to him

02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:43.080
that one can get out of it

02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:45.080
and find alternatives.

02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:07.080

02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:09.080
