00:00.000 --> 00:06.100
Yeah, no, I'm absolutely not going to do this intro in English, I'm sorry.

00:06.100 --> 00:13.420
If you want to listen to my special zombie episode intro, go to the German version and

00:13.420 --> 00:17.520
suffer through the first 20 seconds and then come back.

00:17.520 --> 00:22.100
It really hurt my throat and I'm absolutely not going to do this again.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.640
I'm really sorry.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.120
Maybe, I guess.

00:28.120 --> 00:43.600
Okay, so hello and welcome to the very first English episode of the Corvus Corax podcast.

00:43.600 --> 00:53.640
The topic of today is the zombie, especially in the context of philosophy and yes, first

00:53.840 --> 00:54.920
Let me introduce myself a bit.

00:54.920 --> 01:00.440
I'm a German podcast host.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.480
I've been doing podcasts for about a year now.

01:05.480 --> 01:13.120
I've been doing videos on YouTube generally for seven years now and my wife has been bugging

01:13.120 --> 01:18.880
me to do these podcasts in English too because she thinks my English is quite good and I

01:18.880 --> 01:25.280
think she's making a great mistake in her judgment there, but I guess I've decided to

01:25.280 --> 01:27.120
do this anyways.

01:27.120 --> 01:33.920
So yeah, there we are, okay.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.280
There's a tradition in the German version of the podcast where I tell you what I drink

01:39.280 --> 01:45.360
and the drink that I drink, the beverage has to be a different one every episode.

01:45.360 --> 01:54.640
If there's any sponsor out there, this is the only sponsorship I'd accept, beverages.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.760
Today I'm drinking a wild berry tea.

01:58.760 --> 02:06.560
I don't know if you translate it that way, it's a tea I got from my local tea shop.

02:06.560 --> 02:13.080
Anyways, so okay, zombies, what's up with that?

02:13.560 --> 02:20.760
Let us take a look at the history of the modern image of the zombie.

02:20.760 --> 02:26.240
One can find the origin of the image of the zombie when one takes a look at the American

02:26.240 --> 02:32.480
military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934.

02:32.480 --> 02:39.020
There a legend was persisting through these few strange decades that voodoo magicians

02:39.020 --> 02:45.020
were able to resurrect a body and make it work endlessly.

02:45.020 --> 02:50.900
You have to imagine the zombie happy as Camus probably used to say in an alternate universe,

02:50.900 --> 02:52.680
I guess.

02:52.680 --> 02:57.720
As the news of this legend reached America, the interest in it was growing rapidly in

02:57.720 --> 03:00.340
its popular culture.

03:00.340 --> 03:07.140
This specifically occult image of the zombie rots away and dissolves at a certain point

03:07.260 --> 03:16.940
in the 1970s, which can be traced to the release of a certain movie, George A. Romero's 1968

03:16.940 --> 03:22.500
released movie, Night of the Living Dead, in which the word zombie ironically never appeared

03:22.500 --> 03:24.900
not even once.

03:24.900 --> 03:30.100
Following the discussions of the last few decades in the philosophy of mind, one will

03:30.100 --> 03:36.100
be aware of the fact that the zombie even creeped in here through David Chalmers' influential

03:36.100 --> 03:37.660
essay.

03:37.660 --> 03:43.620
When it comes to the philosophical zombie, it is usually about the critique of physicalism

03:43.620 --> 03:46.420
and or functionalism.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.860
At the center of this criticism lies the term qualia.

03:50.860 --> 03:57.660
Qualia means something like how it is, that is, a qualitative experience.

03:57.660 --> 04:02.640
The functionalist tries to reduce human consciousness to a number of functions.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.540
Take as an example a beverage machine.

04:05.540 --> 04:14.740
You throw a coin into the machine, this changes its internal status from x1 to x2 and it responds

04:14.740 --> 04:20.440
according to the input, which has influenced its internal status.

04:20.440 --> 04:26.980
How and what exactly happens with this internal status and how it is for the beverage machine

04:26.980 --> 04:34.900
does not matter, since the entire work of the machine is described by its function.

04:34.900 --> 04:41.100
Whether gears are working or a ferry uses its magic in the interior, which set the machine

04:41.100 --> 04:46.540
in motion, does not really matter, as long as the machine reacts accordingly.

04:46.540 --> 04:52.020
The same should also be the case with consciousness, only more complex.

04:52.020 --> 04:57.300
We get an input, our internal state changes accordingly and we give a response corresponding

04:57.300 --> 05:02.980
to our new internal state, an output determined by the state.

05:02.980 --> 05:08.220
Here comes the criticism of the philosophical zombie.

05:08.220 --> 05:17.300
If functionalism is true, then the qualitative experience would have to be irrelevant to

05:17.300 --> 05:19.340
the function.

05:19.340 --> 05:23.220
Accordingly philosophical zombies would have to be conceivable.

05:23.220 --> 05:30.780
Of course my explanation is not but a caricature and we should actually be discussing possible

05:31.260 --> 05:36.100
the meaning of conceivability in a metaphysical or even ontological context and so on and

05:36.100 --> 05:42.220
so forth, but I just wanted to utilize this thought experiment to establish the following

05:42.220 --> 05:44.060
assumption.

05:44.060 --> 05:48.660
Consciousness sets us humans apart from zombies.

05:48.660 --> 05:55.220
Of course this assumption is extremely problematic, because we do not know exactly how to handle

05:55.220 --> 05:56.220
it.

05:56.220 --> 06:02.380
How do I know now that my counterpart is not a philosophical zombie?

06:02.380 --> 06:10.460
If the output of his function process are similar or alike, the genuinely human one,

06:10.460 --> 06:13.060
how could I tell them apart?

06:13.060 --> 06:16.660
Here the zombie of popular culture can help us.

06:16.660 --> 06:22.340
For in stories which are about the fact that someone is in the process of transformation

06:22.340 --> 06:29.660
into a zombie, a special aspect of zombie-ing is highlighted.

06:29.660 --> 06:35.580
Zombie-ing is expressed by an increasing loss of self-control.

06:35.580 --> 06:41.500
For this reason there are some zombie movies or books or games in which a character from

06:41.500 --> 06:46.540
a romantic couple becomes a zombie and wants to die rather than survive death and kill

06:46.540 --> 06:50.820
the partner as a will-liberated zombie-ing.

06:50.820 --> 06:56.700
They don't want to turn into an ungetÃ¼m, as one might say.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.980
This also clarifies why being undead is something bad for the living.

07:00.980 --> 07:09.020
However, the question is not answered whether being undead is bad in itself for the undead.

07:09.020 --> 07:16.620
Let's take a look at why death is considered bad, because it's the step in between.

07:16.620 --> 07:23.020
One of the most common strategies in this regard is a desire-frustration theory.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.540
We rate the rejection of something wanted as bad.

07:27.540 --> 07:35.440
And because death frustrates our desires in general, it's something that we should work

07:35.440 --> 07:37.020
our way around.

07:37.020 --> 07:42.520
However, this is not a good argument as to why it is bad for the zombie to be undead.

07:42.520 --> 07:49.160
It may even be that he has a craving for human flesh and brain, and the satisfaction

07:49.160 --> 07:54.960
of this in the sense even speaks for the undead being, for the zombie-ing.

07:54.960 --> 08:01.160
It's an argument for his existence in this specific mode.

08:01.160 --> 08:06.400
If we are already on this hedonistic, utilitarian ground, we could paraphrase John Stuart Mill

08:06.400 --> 08:12.160
here and say that it is better to be a corpse than a satisfied undead, since his cravings

08:12.160 --> 08:16.640
are of a very low quality and the zombie is not in the condition to perform higher

08:16.640 --> 08:19.880
quality cognitive operations.

08:19.880 --> 08:26.660
Here comes an example to mind which Zizek uses to explain his understanding of dialectics.

08:26.660 --> 08:32.440
The dialectical movement of Zizek takes place through the negation of the negation, which

08:32.440 --> 08:34.320
reflects the synthesis.

08:34.320 --> 08:40.160
However, according to Zizek, the negation of the negation is not a return to the thesis,

08:40.160 --> 08:46.280
not a minus, a minus equals plus, but the break with the meaning-giving framework which

08:46.280 --> 08:52.480
makes the tension between thesis and antithesis possible in the first place.

08:52.480 --> 08:59.040
His example is to understand living as the thesis and death as the antithesis, whereupon

08:59.040 --> 09:03.000
the negation of the negation follows in the undead.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.560
The zombie is not alive nor dead, he negates the meaning-giving framework.

09:07.960 --> 09:13.800
Here, however, I would like to draw attention to a weak spot that struck me while reading

09:13.800 --> 09:20.440
Hartwig Schmid's work on nichts und Zeit in English Nothingness and Time.

09:20.440 --> 09:25.320
Zizek's negation of the negation is really just a pageration of the negation.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.240
Pageration is the meaning of the prefix un.

09:29.240 --> 09:34.680
For example, if we say that a person is, and I now have to use a different word, inhumane

09:34.800 --> 09:42.800
in German it's unmenschlich, then we do not doubt his material constitution descriptively,

09:42.800 --> 09:49.680
but say that there is a norm that belongs to the concept of humanity and that this norm

09:49.680 --> 09:52.320
has been broken.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.640
Pageration is the breach of or an underlying norm.

09:56.640 --> 10:03.680
In the case of the undead, it is his unrestrained instinctual drive, his lack of awareness,

10:03.680 --> 10:09.720
and his lack of socio-sexuality that makes up the core of this subversive tendency.

10:09.720 --> 10:15.760
If an undead stood in front of a person who was able to enter into an intimate relationship

10:15.760 --> 10:21.120
with people, had consciousness, and could control his instincts, then he would lose

10:21.120 --> 10:24.680
his rank as an undead in the consciousness of the person.

10:24.680 --> 10:30.320
Well, maybe except for his looks, that might be a distracting factor, I guess.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.640
That's actually why this look is used a lot in Hollywood movies.

10:34.640 --> 10:42.560
How would you distinguish between complex, human-like zombies and humans if it weren't

10:42.560 --> 10:46.740
for this look, you zombie-phobe?

10:46.740 --> 10:50.960
To break it down perhaps a little differently, what distinguishes a person from a zombie

10:50.960 --> 10:55.600
cannot be determined on one level by a single ism.

10:55.680 --> 11:02.120
Functionalistic, phenomenological, and behavioristic observations are needed to clearly state the

11:02.120 --> 11:06.800
difference between human and zombie.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.180
Here we also arrive at a problem of the debate around the philosophical zombie.

11:11.180 --> 11:17.640
The question of whether we can imagine a philosophical zombie is based on an impossibility, for to

11:17.640 --> 11:27.620
imagine what it is like to be a consciousness-free body is not possible due to the a priori

11:27.620 --> 11:31.160
necessity of consciousness for this mental act.

11:31.160 --> 11:36.520
Furthermore, these debates often ignore the fact that self-being and social identity are

11:36.520 --> 11:39.640
related.

11:39.640 --> 11:46.780
Absolute antisocial self-being is unthinkable from birth onwards due to the inevitable

11:46.940 --> 11:49.620
interdependence of human life.

11:49.620 --> 11:56.540
Furthermore, the self needs to be aware of an other and the social context to create

11:56.540 --> 12:02.780
an identity, at least in the psychoanalytical and sociological sense.

12:02.780 --> 12:08.380
Now, one of the main characters or a person who is important to the protagonist becomes

12:08.380 --> 12:09.380
a zombie.

12:09.380 --> 12:14.600
Now, as Lenin would have put it, what is to be done?

12:14.680 --> 12:17.200
The solution is kill the zombie.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.600
Even if it takes a lot of emotional work to be able to do so, just get rid of him.

12:22.600 --> 12:28.080
But why is it still easier for us to kill a zombie than a human?

12:28.080 --> 12:32.760
Here I'd like to discuss the question of the value of a zombie.

12:32.760 --> 12:40.820
What could be the central factor of zombie-ing that makes it less valuable relative to humans?

12:40.820 --> 12:44.180
Is it the terrible acts that it commits?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.580
For some, yes.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.020
But for most, no.

12:47.020 --> 12:53.780
Most are against the death penalty, even in cases of serious crimes.

12:53.780 --> 12:58.740
Is it the absence or severe limitation of the zombie's mental performance?

12:58.740 --> 12:59.740
For some, yes.

12:59.740 --> 13:00.980
But for most, no.

13:00.980 --> 13:06.500
Most people would not consider the murder of someone who has lost their consciousness,

13:06.500 --> 13:11.820
who has a mental disability or the like, to be morally defensible.

13:12.260 --> 13:15.380
Incidentally, this is an argument often made in the vegan debate.

13:15.380 --> 13:18.740
So why kill zombies?

13:18.740 --> 13:23.940
Maybe you should ask yourself why he does not or should kill zombies, I don't know.

13:23.940 --> 13:29.380
Maybe it's changing the identity of the person, the emergence of a different identity.

13:29.380 --> 13:34.660
Perhaps we justify it by either no longer being obliged to the previous identity in

13:34.660 --> 13:42.620
the sense of a contract theory, or else we are acting out of an obligation to the pre-zombie

13:42.620 --> 13:45.020
identity of the person.

13:45.020 --> 13:50.220
Both things could be a possibility, but is it really a different identity we're talking

13:50.220 --> 13:51.580
about?

13:51.580 --> 13:55.980
We assume that the zombie's brain no longer works as before, but how much of the brain

13:55.980 --> 14:01.500
must stop functioning, or functioning in the same way as before, before we speak of another

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
person?

14:02.700 --> 14:07.940
Like at the end of Shaun of the Dead, we somehow get the murderer's tendencies under control.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.380
Isn't it still the same person we're playing video games with?

14:11.380 --> 14:17.180
To go the way through the brain death criterion, to declare the undead as dead, is one possibility,

14:17.180 --> 14:21.940
but the undead breaks the life-death dichotomy by his actions, which is why this attempt

14:21.940 --> 14:24.340
would be utterly futile.

14:24.340 --> 14:28.780
So in order to propose an understanding of the self, which knows no hard limits, but

14:28.780 --> 14:35.260
allows more transitions and blurring, we abandon the essentialist approach and see

14:35.260 --> 14:39.140
the self as some kind of fiction.

14:39.140 --> 14:48.380
With Hume and Parfit, we can understand the self as the existence of a psychological continuity.

14:48.380 --> 14:54.620
To put it in a nutshell, if there will be one future person who will have enough of

14:54.620 --> 15:01.020
my brain to be psychologically continuous with me, that person would be me.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.700
As Parfit writes,

15:03.340 --> 15:08.540
Imagine being decomposed at a teleporter to your atoms and reconstructed at the other

15:08.540 --> 15:09.540
end.

15:09.540 --> 15:16.220
Then one actually died, but is not dead, since the reconstruction possesses the psychological

15:16.220 --> 15:20.900
continuity of the previous self.

15:20.900 --> 15:25.780
If we approach the matter from this framework, then we can say that regardless of the state

15:25.780 --> 15:33.380
of the brain, the zombies are not identical to their previous self, since their purpose

15:33.380 --> 15:37.180
in life has fundamentally changed.

15:37.180 --> 15:42.180
At least in most cases, there certainly are humans that like to eat human meat, and they

15:42.180 --> 15:47.180
can be fairly nice, I guess, at least according to Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

15:47.180 --> 15:54.340
Anyways, their purpose in life has changed, because their lives are now limited, aimed

15:54.500 --> 15:56.380
at the goal of eating human flesh.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.180
That's the limit of it.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.860
However, we encounter problems here as well.

16:00.860 --> 16:05.420
For example, what about a situation in which someone was indoctrinated by some sect and

16:05.420 --> 16:06.860
now thinks he is reborn?

16:06.860 --> 16:09.820
Do we lose our previous duties to this person?

16:09.820 --> 16:13.260
For example, don't we still owe him any money?

16:13.260 --> 16:21.700
So if I owe someone money, should I just send him to some kind of church and let him be

16:21.820 --> 16:26.100
indoctrinated and then I don't owe him any money anymore?

16:26.100 --> 16:28.620
This realization seems rather bizarre.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.340
A look at Sean for the Dead may help us here again.

16:31.340 --> 16:37.980
In our everyday lives, we perform some actions as in an automatism.

16:37.980 --> 16:41.180
In these situations, functionalism seems to succeed.

16:41.180 --> 16:47.180
However, it is our ability to plan for the future and to consciously adapt our actions

16:47.180 --> 16:53.220
accordingly, the brief moments of everyday clarity that distinguish us from the zombie.

16:53.220 --> 16:58.860
If we look at Sean, then for the first time in a long time, he had made the decision for

16:58.860 --> 17:02.220
the future and forged a plan.

17:02.220 --> 17:13.860
First they go to his mother's house and pick them up, take care of the zombified father,

17:14.860 --> 17:18.340
drive to his ex-girlfriend's house and drink tea at hers.

17:18.340 --> 17:24.660
The second plan, because the story progresses and things don't go exactly how they would

17:24.660 --> 17:31.020
like it to be, is to drive to the house of the mother, take care of the zombified stepfather,

17:31.020 --> 17:34.140
pick up the eggs and drive back to his place for a cup of tea.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.500
And the third plan was to drive to the mother's house, get the mother, take the stepfather

17:38.500 --> 17:42.780
down, get the eggs and go to the pub and drink until it's all over, which seems to be the

17:42.780 --> 17:45.460
best plan of all three.

17:45.460 --> 17:52.540
At the end of the movie, Sean's girlfriend says in reference to the fact that it was

17:52.540 --> 17:59.980
not the plan itself and his choice of what to do that was important, but that he had

17:59.980 --> 18:04.900
even made a decision and tried to make it a reality.

18:04.900 --> 18:10.340
And this might be something that some people who are interested in politics should take

18:10.420 --> 18:18.940
a look at, at least around here in Germany.

18:18.940 --> 18:25.940
One might think of Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of transcendence, which lies at the core of

18:25.940 --> 18:28.460
human freedom, at least for him.

18:28.460 --> 18:34.740
What makes man free is his ability to think of oneself in the future, that is to transcend,

18:34.740 --> 18:37.340
to act on this image of the future.

18:37.340 --> 18:44.020
Even if we accept the factor of transcendence, we have not covered every form of zombie.

18:44.020 --> 18:49.860
However, it should be clear how stimulating thinking about zombies can be.

18:49.860 --> 18:55.020
In the end, I cannot tell you how you should act toward a zombie.

18:55.020 --> 18:57.700
Self-defense is probably okay, I guess.

18:57.700 --> 19:03.620
I don't even have my own theory of personality that could satisfy me, especially the diversity

19:03.620 --> 19:06.900
of the zombie makes it all the more difficult.

19:06.900 --> 19:14.860
Here is a list, very incomplete, of things one should keep in mind when attempting to

19:14.860 --> 19:18.100
write seriously about zombies.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.940
Zombies do not exist.

19:19.940 --> 19:23.540
Zombies are not related to werewolves or vampires.

19:23.540 --> 19:30.300
Zombies are not, literally, mindless consumers, enraged proletarians or stupid Americans,

19:30.300 --> 19:33.660
although some were probably once these things.

19:33.660 --> 19:38.660
And there is little use in casting them, even metaphorically, as essentially such,

19:38.660 --> 19:42.860
especially when attempting to offer a theory of zombies.

19:42.860 --> 19:49.760
This is because zombies do not form a natural kind, not even a fictional natural kind.

19:49.760 --> 19:57.020
Within the genre, zombies vary greatly in behavior, cognitive power and athletic ability.

19:57.020 --> 20:02.620
Some shamble, some run at or near Olympic speeds, some are incapable of manipulating

20:02.620 --> 20:07.920
even simple objects, others play video games with erstwhile friends, some behave better,

20:07.920 --> 20:12.700
at least not worse than the living, others are Nazis, some are created by ill-advised

20:12.700 --> 20:16.380
government programs, others by hearing Canadian English.

20:16.380 --> 20:21.540
All of this makes it difficult and likely a colossal waste of time to make grand general

20:21.540 --> 20:26.220
pronouncements on the nature of the living dead, the interests they hold for us or their

20:26.220 --> 20:32.580
basic cultural significance, which is just as well, since I do not have a theory of zombies.

20:33.540 --> 20:38.540
In fact, my claim is that zombies can offer a particular kind of philosophical and aesthetic

20:38.540 --> 20:45.020
reward precisely when we do not know just what they are, what animates them or what

20:45.020 --> 20:49.100
it amounts to when we get to work killing them.

20:49.100 --> 20:54.660
Self-defense notwithstanding.

20:54.660 --> 20:59.180
One could end this episode here, but I am not finished yet.

20:59.180 --> 21:03.500
Of course, the zombie also has a political meaning.

21:03.500 --> 21:10.020
In some zombie movies, series and games, children and adolescents also live in the zombified

21:10.020 --> 21:11.140
world.

21:11.140 --> 21:16.260
They cannot imagine a world that would be worth recreating, since they grew up in the

21:16.260 --> 21:18.080
zombified world.

21:18.080 --> 21:23.780
And I think we can glean some interesting insights into today's political situation

21:23.780 --> 21:30.900
from Peter Sloterdijk's critique of cynical reason and Slava Zizek's sublime object.

21:30.900 --> 21:37.220
For these children, the desire of adults to reclaim a world that is worthy of being recreated

21:37.220 --> 21:44.700
with their ancient traditions, their understanding of family, work, etc. is a pure ideology.

21:44.700 --> 21:50.500
One of Sloterdijk's key ideas is that it has to get better before something sensitive

21:50.500 --> 21:52.000
can be learned.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.080
The consequence of this is that our learning today is not designed to solve the problems

21:56.080 --> 21:59.840
of the future, it rather creates them.

21:59.840 --> 22:05.220
In both Zizek's pure ideology and Sloterdijk's false consciousness of the Enlightenment,

22:05.220 --> 22:07.800
we find a leitmotif.

22:07.800 --> 22:15.200
The previous tries to reproduce in a world that exposes the past as a sham, resulting

22:15.200 --> 22:22.480
in the generation zombie, for whom this quasi-utopian world loses all credibility.

22:22.480 --> 22:27.840
This aimlessness provides the breeding ground for a world in which everyone becomes a zombie

22:27.840 --> 22:32.720
more and more without wanting to, but also without a way out.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.880
The end of history is the beginning of the zombified world.

22:36.880 --> 22:43.380
It's not so much the often vilified social media that turns people into zombies, it is

22:43.620 --> 22:49.820
much more the participation in the ideological carnival and the neoliberal straightjacket

22:49.820 --> 22:56.020
of the bourgeois, who seeks protection in an unreflected illusory centrism and dives

22:56.020 --> 23:01.140
into his supposedly apolitical everyday life.

23:01.140 --> 23:07.100
So what do I really want to say in the end of it all?

23:07.100 --> 23:08.100
I don't know.

23:08.620 --> 23:18.660
I guess it's an entertaining movie, I'll probably watch it too.

23:18.660 --> 23:24.900
Maybe don't kill zombies, talk to them first, I don't know, throw them into a gulag, make

23:24.900 --> 23:30.660
them useful, as if I have all the answers.

23:30.660 --> 23:33.300
That's not my job, I'm just a voice.

23:33.380 --> 23:38.020
Okay, so that was the first English episode of the podcast.

23:38.020 --> 23:47.620
Depending on the reaction I get, I'll continue to producing this podcast in German and English.

23:47.620 --> 23:51.500
If there's no interest at all in it, well, that's it, I guess.

23:51.500 --> 23:59.060
So if you are interested in me continuing this podcast in English, then give me some

23:59.220 --> 24:09.540
feedback wherever you listen to this, Spotify, YouTube, I don't know, Anchor, Google Podcast.

24:09.540 --> 24:16.340
Anyways, have a nice time interval, I guess.

28:59.380 --> 29:01.380
I hope you enjoyed watching this podcast.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.380
If you did, please like and subscribe.

29:03.380 --> 29:05.380
I'll see you next time.

29:05.380 --> 29:07.380
Bye.
