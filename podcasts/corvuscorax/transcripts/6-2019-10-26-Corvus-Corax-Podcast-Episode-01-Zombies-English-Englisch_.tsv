0	6100	Yeah, no, I'm absolutely not going to do this intro in English, I'm sorry.
6100	13420	If you want to listen to my special zombie episode intro, go to the German version and
13420	17520	suffer through the first 20 seconds and then come back.
17520	22100	It really hurt my throat and I'm absolutely not going to do this again.
22100	23640	I'm really sorry.
23640	28120	Maybe, I guess.
28120	43600	Okay, so hello and welcome to the very first English episode of the Corvus Corax podcast.
43600	53640	The topic of today is the zombie, especially in the context of philosophy and yes, first
53840	54920	Let me introduce myself a bit.
54920	60440	I'm a German podcast host.
60440	65480	I've been doing podcasts for about a year now.
65480	73120	I've been doing videos on YouTube generally for seven years now and my wife has been bugging
73120	78880	me to do these podcasts in English too because she thinks my English is quite good and I
78880	85280	think she's making a great mistake in her judgment there, but I guess I've decided to
85280	87120	do this anyways.
87120	93920	So yeah, there we are, okay.
93920	99280	There's a tradition in the German version of the podcast where I tell you what I drink
99280	105360	and the drink that I drink, the beverage has to be a different one every episode.
105360	114640	If there's any sponsor out there, this is the only sponsorship I'd accept, beverages.
114640	118760	Today I'm drinking a wild berry tea.
118760	126560	I don't know if you translate it that way, it's a tea I got from my local tea shop.
126560	133080	Anyways, so okay, zombies, what's up with that?
133560	140760	Let us take a look at the history of the modern image of the zombie.
140760	146240	One can find the origin of the image of the zombie when one takes a look at the American
146240	152480	military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934.
152480	159020	There a legend was persisting through these few strange decades that voodoo magicians
159020	165020	were able to resurrect a body and make it work endlessly.
165020	170900	You have to imagine the zombie happy as Camus probably used to say in an alternate universe,
170900	172680	I guess.
172680	177720	As the news of this legend reached America, the interest in it was growing rapidly in
177720	180340	its popular culture.
180340	187140	This specifically occult image of the zombie rots away and dissolves at a certain point
187260	196940	in the 1970s, which can be traced to the release of a certain movie, George A. Romero's 1968
196940	202500	released movie, Night of the Living Dead, in which the word zombie ironically never appeared
202500	204900	not even once.
204900	210100	Following the discussions of the last few decades in the philosophy of mind, one will
210100	216100	be aware of the fact that the zombie even creeped in here through David Chalmers' influential
216100	217660	essay.
217660	223620	When it comes to the philosophical zombie, it is usually about the critique of physicalism
223620	226420	and or functionalism.
226420	230860	At the center of this criticism lies the term qualia.
230860	237660	Qualia means something like how it is, that is, a qualitative experience.
237660	242640	The functionalist tries to reduce human consciousness to a number of functions.
242640	245540	Take as an example a beverage machine.
245540	254740	You throw a coin into the machine, this changes its internal status from x1 to x2 and it responds
254740	260440	according to the input, which has influenced its internal status.
260440	266980	How and what exactly happens with this internal status and how it is for the beverage machine
266980	274900	does not matter, since the entire work of the machine is described by its function.
274900	281100	Whether gears are working or a ferry uses its magic in the interior, which set the machine
281100	286540	in motion, does not really matter, as long as the machine reacts accordingly.
286540	292020	The same should also be the case with consciousness, only more complex.
292020	297300	We get an input, our internal state changes accordingly and we give a response corresponding
297300	302980	to our new internal state, an output determined by the state.
302980	308220	Here comes the criticism of the philosophical zombie.
308220	317300	If functionalism is true, then the qualitative experience would have to be irrelevant to
317300	319340	the function.
319340	323220	Accordingly philosophical zombies would have to be conceivable.
323220	330780	Of course my explanation is not but a caricature and we should actually be discussing possible
331260	336100	the meaning of conceivability in a metaphysical or even ontological context and so on and
336100	342220	so forth, but I just wanted to utilize this thought experiment to establish the following
342220	344060	assumption.
344060	348660	Consciousness sets us humans apart from zombies.
348660	355220	Of course this assumption is extremely problematic, because we do not know exactly how to handle
355220	356220	it.
356220	362380	How do I know now that my counterpart is not a philosophical zombie?
362380	370460	If the output of his function process are similar or alike, the genuinely human one,
370460	373060	how could I tell them apart?
373060	376660	Here the zombie of popular culture can help us.
376660	382340	For in stories which are about the fact that someone is in the process of transformation
382340	389660	into a zombie, a special aspect of zombie-ing is highlighted.
389660	395580	Zombie-ing is expressed by an increasing loss of self-control.
395580	401500	For this reason there are some zombie movies or books or games in which a character from
401500	406540	a romantic couple becomes a zombie and wants to die rather than survive death and kill
406540	410820	the partner as a will-liberated zombie-ing.
410820	416700	They don't want to turn into an unget√ºm, as one might say.
416700	420980	This also clarifies why being undead is something bad for the living.
420980	429020	However, the question is not answered whether being undead is bad in itself for the undead.
429020	436620	Let's take a look at why death is considered bad, because it's the step in between.
436620	443020	One of the most common strategies in this regard is a desire-frustration theory.
443020	447540	We rate the rejection of something wanted as bad.
447540	455440	And because death frustrates our desires in general, it's something that we should work
455440	457020	our way around.
457020	462520	However, this is not a good argument as to why it is bad for the zombie to be undead.
462520	469160	It may even be that he has a craving for human flesh and brain, and the satisfaction
469160	474960	of this in the sense even speaks for the undead being, for the zombie-ing.
474960	481160	It's an argument for his existence in this specific mode.
481160	486400	If we are already on this hedonistic, utilitarian ground, we could paraphrase John Stuart Mill
486400	492160	here and say that it is better to be a corpse than a satisfied undead, since his cravings
492160	496640	are of a very low quality and the zombie is not in the condition to perform higher
496640	499880	quality cognitive operations.
499880	506660	Here comes an example to mind which Zizek uses to explain his understanding of dialectics.
506660	512440	The dialectical movement of Zizek takes place through the negation of the negation, which
512440	514320	reflects the synthesis.
514320	520160	However, according to Zizek, the negation of the negation is not a return to the thesis,
520160	526280	not a minus, a minus equals plus, but the break with the meaning-giving framework which
526280	532480	makes the tension between thesis and antithesis possible in the first place.
532480	539040	His example is to understand living as the thesis and death as the antithesis, whereupon
539040	543000	the negation of the negation follows in the undead.
543000	547560	The zombie is not alive nor dead, he negates the meaning-giving framework.
547960	553800	Here, however, I would like to draw attention to a weak spot that struck me while reading
553800	560440	Hartwig Schmid's work on nichts und Zeit in English Nothingness and Time.
560440	565320	Zizek's negation of the negation is really just a pageration of the negation.
565320	569240	Pageration is the meaning of the prefix un.
569240	574680	For example, if we say that a person is, and I now have to use a different word, inhumane
574800	582800	in German it's unmenschlich, then we do not doubt his material constitution descriptively,
582800	589680	but say that there is a norm that belongs to the concept of humanity and that this norm
589680	592320	has been broken.
592320	596640	Pageration is the breach of or an underlying norm.
596640	603680	In the case of the undead, it is his unrestrained instinctual drive, his lack of awareness,
603680	609720	and his lack of socio-sexuality that makes up the core of this subversive tendency.
609720	615760	If an undead stood in front of a person who was able to enter into an intimate relationship
615760	621120	with people, had consciousness, and could control his instincts, then he would lose
621120	624680	his rank as an undead in the consciousness of the person.
624680	630320	Well, maybe except for his looks, that might be a distracting factor, I guess.
630320	634640	That's actually why this look is used a lot in Hollywood movies.
634640	642560	How would you distinguish between complex, human-like zombies and humans if it weren't
642560	646740	for this look, you zombie-phobe?
646740	650960	To break it down perhaps a little differently, what distinguishes a person from a zombie
650960	655600	cannot be determined on one level by a single ism.
655680	662120	Functionalistic, phenomenological, and behavioristic observations are needed to clearly state the
662120	666800	difference between human and zombie.
666800	671180	Here we also arrive at a problem of the debate around the philosophical zombie.
671180	677640	The question of whether we can imagine a philosophical zombie is based on an impossibility, for to
677640	687620	imagine what it is like to be a consciousness-free body is not possible due to the a priori
687620	691160	necessity of consciousness for this mental act.
691160	696520	Furthermore, these debates often ignore the fact that self-being and social identity are
696520	699640	related.
699640	706780	Absolute antisocial self-being is unthinkable from birth onwards due to the inevitable
706940	709620	interdependence of human life.
709620	716540	Furthermore, the self needs to be aware of an other and the social context to create
716540	722780	an identity, at least in the psychoanalytical and sociological sense.
722780	728380	Now, one of the main characters or a person who is important to the protagonist becomes
728380	729380	a zombie.
729380	734600	Now, as Lenin would have put it, what is to be done?
734680	737200	The solution is kill the zombie.
737200	742600	Even if it takes a lot of emotional work to be able to do so, just get rid of him.
742600	748080	But why is it still easier for us to kill a zombie than a human?
748080	752760	Here I'd like to discuss the question of the value of a zombie.
752760	760820	What could be the central factor of zombie-ing that makes it less valuable relative to humans?
760820	764180	Is it the terrible acts that it commits?
764180	765580	For some, yes.
765580	767020	But for most, no.
767020	773780	Most are against the death penalty, even in cases of serious crimes.
773780	778740	Is it the absence or severe limitation of the zombie's mental performance?
778740	779740	For some, yes.
779740	780980	But for most, no.
780980	786500	Most people would not consider the murder of someone who has lost their consciousness,
786500	791820	who has a mental disability or the like, to be morally defensible.
792260	795380	Incidentally, this is an argument often made in the vegan debate.
795380	798740	So why kill zombies?
798740	803940	Maybe you should ask yourself why he does not or should kill zombies, I don't know.
803940	809380	Maybe it's changing the identity of the person, the emergence of a different identity.
809380	814660	Perhaps we justify it by either no longer being obliged to the previous identity in
814660	822620	the sense of a contract theory, or else we are acting out of an obligation to the pre-zombie
822620	825020	identity of the person.
825020	830220	Both things could be a possibility, but is it really a different identity we're talking
830220	831580	about?
831580	835980	We assume that the zombie's brain no longer works as before, but how much of the brain
835980	841500	must stop functioning, or functioning in the same way as before, before we speak of another
841500	842500	person?
842700	847940	Like at the end of Shaun of the Dead, we somehow get the murderer's tendencies under control.
847940	851380	Isn't it still the same person we're playing video games with?
851380	857180	To go the way through the brain death criterion, to declare the undead as dead, is one possibility,
857180	861940	but the undead breaks the life-death dichotomy by his actions, which is why this attempt
861940	864340	would be utterly futile.
864340	868780	So in order to propose an understanding of the self, which knows no hard limits, but
868780	875260	allows more transitions and blurring, we abandon the essentialist approach and see
875260	879140	the self as some kind of fiction.
879140	888380	With Hume and Parfit, we can understand the self as the existence of a psychological continuity.
888380	894620	To put it in a nutshell, if there will be one future person who will have enough of
894620	901020	my brain to be psychologically continuous with me, that person would be me.
901020	902700	As Parfit writes,
903340	908540	Imagine being decomposed at a teleporter to your atoms and reconstructed at the other
908540	909540	end.
909540	916220	Then one actually died, but is not dead, since the reconstruction possesses the psychological
916220	920900	continuity of the previous self.
920900	925780	If we approach the matter from this framework, then we can say that regardless of the state
925780	933380	of the brain, the zombies are not identical to their previous self, since their purpose
933380	937180	in life has fundamentally changed.
937180	942180	At least in most cases, there certainly are humans that like to eat human meat, and they
942180	947180	can be fairly nice, I guess, at least according to Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
947180	954340	Anyways, their purpose in life has changed, because their lives are now limited, aimed
954500	956380	at the goal of eating human flesh.
956380	958180	That's the limit of it.
958180	960860	However, we encounter problems here as well.
960860	965420	For example, what about a situation in which someone was indoctrinated by some sect and
965420	966860	now thinks he is reborn?
966860	969820	Do we lose our previous duties to this person?
969820	973260	For example, don't we still owe him any money?
973260	981700	So if I owe someone money, should I just send him to some kind of church and let him be
981820	986100	indoctrinated and then I don't owe him any money anymore?
986100	988620	This realization seems rather bizarre.
988620	991340	A look at Sean for the Dead may help us here again.
991340	997980	In our everyday lives, we perform some actions as in an automatism.
997980	1001180	In these situations, functionalism seems to succeed.
1001180	1007180	However, it is our ability to plan for the future and to consciously adapt our actions
1007180	1013220	accordingly, the brief moments of everyday clarity that distinguish us from the zombie.
1013220	1018860	If we look at Sean, then for the first time in a long time, he had made the decision for
1018860	1022220	the future and forged a plan.
1022220	1033860	First they go to his mother's house and pick them up, take care of the zombified father,
1034860	1038340	drive to his ex-girlfriend's house and drink tea at hers.
1038340	1044660	The second plan, because the story progresses and things don't go exactly how they would
1044660	1051020	like it to be, is to drive to the house of the mother, take care of the zombified stepfather,
1051020	1054140	pick up the eggs and drive back to his place for a cup of tea.
1054140	1058500	And the third plan was to drive to the mother's house, get the mother, take the stepfather
1058500	1062780	down, get the eggs and go to the pub and drink until it's all over, which seems to be the
1062780	1065460	best plan of all three.
1065460	1072540	At the end of the movie, Sean's girlfriend says in reference to the fact that it was
1072540	1079980	not the plan itself and his choice of what to do that was important, but that he had
1079980	1084900	even made a decision and tried to make it a reality.
1084900	1090340	And this might be something that some people who are interested in politics should take
1090420	1098940	a look at, at least around here in Germany.
1098940	1105940	One might think of Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of transcendence, which lies at the core of
1105940	1108460	human freedom, at least for him.
1108460	1114740	What makes man free is his ability to think of oneself in the future, that is to transcend,
1114740	1117340	to act on this image of the future.
1117340	1124020	Even if we accept the factor of transcendence, we have not covered every form of zombie.
1124020	1129860	However, it should be clear how stimulating thinking about zombies can be.
1129860	1135020	In the end, I cannot tell you how you should act toward a zombie.
1135020	1137700	Self-defense is probably okay, I guess.
1137700	1143620	I don't even have my own theory of personality that could satisfy me, especially the diversity
1143620	1146900	of the zombie makes it all the more difficult.
1146900	1154860	Here is a list, very incomplete, of things one should keep in mind when attempting to
1154860	1158100	write seriously about zombies.
1158100	1159940	Zombies do not exist.
1159940	1163540	Zombies are not related to werewolves or vampires.
1163540	1170300	Zombies are not, literally, mindless consumers, enraged proletarians or stupid Americans,
1170300	1173660	although some were probably once these things.
1173660	1178660	And there is little use in casting them, even metaphorically, as essentially such,
1178660	1182860	especially when attempting to offer a theory of zombies.
1182860	1189760	This is because zombies do not form a natural kind, not even a fictional natural kind.
1189760	1197020	Within the genre, zombies vary greatly in behavior, cognitive power and athletic ability.
1197020	1202620	Some shamble, some run at or near Olympic speeds, some are incapable of manipulating
1202620	1207920	even simple objects, others play video games with erstwhile friends, some behave better,
1207920	1212700	at least not worse than the living, others are Nazis, some are created by ill-advised
1212700	1216380	government programs, others by hearing Canadian English.
1216380	1221540	All of this makes it difficult and likely a colossal waste of time to make grand general
1221540	1226220	pronouncements on the nature of the living dead, the interests they hold for us or their
1226220	1232580	basic cultural significance, which is just as well, since I do not have a theory of zombies.
1233540	1238540	In fact, my claim is that zombies can offer a particular kind of philosophical and aesthetic
1238540	1245020	reward precisely when we do not know just what they are, what animates them or what
1245020	1249100	it amounts to when we get to work killing them.
1249100	1254660	Self-defense notwithstanding.
1254660	1259180	One could end this episode here, but I am not finished yet.
1259180	1263500	Of course, the zombie also has a political meaning.
1263500	1270020	In some zombie movies, series and games, children and adolescents also live in the zombified
1270020	1271140	world.
1271140	1276260	They cannot imagine a world that would be worth recreating, since they grew up in the
1276260	1278080	zombified world.
1278080	1283780	And I think we can glean some interesting insights into today's political situation
1283780	1290900	from Peter Sloterdijk's critique of cynical reason and Slava Zizek's sublime object.
1290900	1297220	For these children, the desire of adults to reclaim a world that is worthy of being recreated
1297220	1304700	with their ancient traditions, their understanding of family, work, etc. is a pure ideology.
1304700	1310500	One of Sloterdijk's key ideas is that it has to get better before something sensitive
1310500	1312000	can be learned.
1312000	1316080	The consequence of this is that our learning today is not designed to solve the problems
1316080	1319840	of the future, it rather creates them.
1319840	1325220	In both Zizek's pure ideology and Sloterdijk's false consciousness of the Enlightenment,
1325220	1327800	we find a leitmotif.
1327800	1335200	The previous tries to reproduce in a world that exposes the past as a sham, resulting
1335200	1342480	in the generation zombie, for whom this quasi-utopian world loses all credibility.
1342480	1347840	This aimlessness provides the breeding ground for a world in which everyone becomes a zombie
1347840	1352720	more and more without wanting to, but also without a way out.
1352720	1356880	The end of history is the beginning of the zombified world.
1356880	1363380	It's not so much the often vilified social media that turns people into zombies, it is
1363620	1369820	much more the participation in the ideological carnival and the neoliberal straightjacket
1369820	1376020	of the bourgeois, who seeks protection in an unreflected illusory centrism and dives
1376020	1381140	into his supposedly apolitical everyday life.
1381140	1387100	So what do I really want to say in the end of it all?
1387100	1388100	I don't know.
1388620	1398660	I guess it's an entertaining movie, I'll probably watch it too.
1398660	1404900	Maybe don't kill zombies, talk to them first, I don't know, throw them into a gulag, make
1404900	1410660	them useful, as if I have all the answers.
1410660	1413300	That's not my job, I'm just a voice.
1413380	1418020	Okay, so that was the first English episode of the podcast.
1418020	1427620	Depending on the reaction I get, I'll continue to producing this podcast in German and English.
1427620	1431500	If there's no interest at all in it, well, that's it, I guess.
1431500	1439060	So if you are interested in me continuing this podcast in English, then give me some
1439220	1449540	feedback wherever you listen to this, Spotify, YouTube, I don't know, Anchor, Google Podcast.
1449540	1456340	Anyways, have a nice time interval, I guess.
1739380	1741380	I hope you enjoyed watching this podcast.
1741380	1743380	If you did, please like and subscribe.
1743380	1745380	I'll see you next time.
1745380	1747380	Bye.
