00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
In dieser Episode des Podcasts spreche ich mit Aaron Rabinovitz mit meinem schlechten

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,440
Englisch über das Phänomen des ganz stupide übersetzt moralischen Glücks.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,400
Eine deutsche Zusammenfassung für alle, die entweder kein Englisch können oder sich mein

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,960
Englisch nicht antun wollen, würde es am Ende noch zusätzlich geben.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,920
Wenn ihr diesen Podcast unterstützen wollt oder bei dem Gast vorbeischauen wollt, dann

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,480
schaut doch mal in die Beschreibung.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
Mit diesen Worten viel Spaß.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,640
Welcome back, everyone.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,920
Today in the 17th Episode of the Podcast, we have a very special guest.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,880
He's the person or entity behind one of my favorite podcasts.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,760
And I think he can introduce himself a bit, if that's okay for you.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Sure.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,040
My name is Aaron Rabinovitz.

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,080
I teach at Rutgers University and do Embrace the Void Podcast and the Philosophers in Space

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,840
Podcast and generally hang around social medias, trying to get people to argue about

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
philosophy.

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Great.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,920
So today's topic will be moral luck because a lot of the viewers wanted me to talk about

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,320
it and that's not really my specialty.

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,800
But as far as I'm aware, you have thought quite a bit about the topic.

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Am I correct?

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Yeah.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm certainly obsessed with the topic.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,760
I don't know if I have anything particularly insightful or useful to say about it, but

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,600
I can certainly explain why I'm obsessed with it.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Great.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:10,120
I think that would be even better than just saying something very important.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Fair enough.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,040
No, no, because I think if you're able to motivate some viewers to think about the topic,

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,600
I think that will have a more positive outcome than if you just say something that would

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,240
finish the whole topic for the viewer.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,320
So just before we really get into the topic, I have to do something that I always do.

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,240
I always have a different drink in the show.

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,760
It's a really boring drink as always.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,280
Today I have the star drink, orange zero sugar, just so that everyone knows and can

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,320
be aware of me annoying them with the sounds of me drinking.

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,360
Do you have anything to drink on your end?

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,040
So over here it's 11 a.m., so I'm sticking with water at the moment, depending on what

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,640
particular podcast I'm recording and what the content is that that can scale up in various

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,760
ways towards whiskey.

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,240
Okay, great.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,480
So I guess we could just start.

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:24,240
So the first question would be what moral luck is or what moral luck means.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,760
What are we talking about?

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah, so moral luck refers to situations where a person is held morally responsible for

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,640
something that is beyond their control.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:45,000
So in contexts where, you know, someone is seen as guilty of a crime and punished for

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,600
doing that crime, even though it seems like the fact that they did that crime was beyond

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,080
their control in some important way, would be the sort of classic examples of moral

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
luck.

52
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,760
And the view that I hold is that pretty much all moral judgments are cases of moral luck

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
because everything is entirely the result of luck.

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,160
Everything is just luck all the way down.

55
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,480
And so that raises real problems for someone like me, who also believes that moral judgments

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,240
are real and true and apply objectively and that we should care about them.

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,080
So how one reconciles those two things, that's that's really tricky dance.

58
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,040
But I think it's good.

59
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,640
Yeah, on that note, I just have a question on your definition of luck.

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,920
So what would you define as luck?

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,080
Yeah, and so this gets a little tricky to avoid kind of circularities here.

62
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,360
But I think luck refers to things that are beyond our control.

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,840
So the sort of textbook examples that we can think of are, you know, if you're playing a

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,280
video game or something that has a random number generator in it, right, it rolls a

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
number that you have no control over.

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,320
And that element of luck, you know, shapes the way that the game is played or how how

67
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,880
these kind of games work.

68
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Right. So, you know, other examples of, you know, really cases of really good or really

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,640
bad luck. Right.

70
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,000
You happen to be born into a family where you inherit massive amounts of wealth versus

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880
being born into an abusive household, for example.

72
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,160
Right. These are things that I think there's lots of things that we can reasonably say

73
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,440
are beyond people's control.

74
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,120
Those are the things that I think of as, you know, the features of the world that are luck

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,240
in relation to me and in relation to other entities.

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,920
And then the hard jump is and everything counts as luck.

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,160
Right. And like all of the things are things that are beyond your control in an important

78
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,160
sense. OK, so that that actually was one thing that that was quite problematic for me

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,760
when I first read about it, because to me it seems like a problem that I also have with

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,440
determinism or fatalism, because in a certain way, if you can apply this concept to

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,880
absolutely everything, it seems to me very trivial, like the meaning.

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,600
It in a certain sense destroys its own meaning.

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,640
Its own impact, because.

84
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,560
Right. It cannot not apply.

85
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,960
Well, so there's a tension right between universality and triviality.

86
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,400
Right. Like we have a similar sort of thing in ethics, I think, where, you know,

87
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,600
you want your moral judgments to be your moral premises to be universal.

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
You want them to apply to everyone in all situations, in all contexts.

89
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,480
And if they don't, that can seem problematic.

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,640
But then some folks will argue the flip side of that is you end up with moral principles

91
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,720
that are incredibly trivial in some kind of way.

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,080
And then the hard work becomes teasing out if there really is anything that this adds

93
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
to the conversation.

94
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Now, here's why I don't think that this is trivial is because I think a lot actually

95
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,720
really does hang on whether or not everything is beyond our control or not.

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,280
If it's true that certain things are under our control and certain things aren't, that's

97
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,440
going to have really important implications for how we shape society, how we treat good

98
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,960
people and bad people.

99
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,120
So I don't think that we can say that this is trivial merely in virtue of the fact that

100
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,080
my position is to argue that everything qualifies as luck, because I think that is a

101
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,600
substantive claim that has substantial implications.

102
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
That makes sense?

103
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,800
Yeah, it absolutely makes sense.

104
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:12,560
But I'm wondering if it is really that important, if it would actually, let's say, let's

105
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
say you're absolutely correct.

106
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:23,920
But would it really change anything in the way of how we experience the world, how we

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,520
experience moral dilemmas and so on?

108
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,520
I absolutely think so.

109
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
I think that there really is a genuine tension, because so here's why the moral luck problem

110
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,960
and Nagle, I think, does a great job explaining this arises because of a natural feature of

111
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,360
morality, which is that we do think that people should only be held morally responsible

112
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
for things that are under their control.

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,520
That's a natural condition for moral judgments.

114
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,000
Right. If someone took over your body and went on a killing spree with your body, we

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,560
wouldn't think that you should be held morally responsible for that killing spree.

116
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,200
So. So I do think it's important and where we see the implications in the real world

117
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
would be in things like how we structure our judicial system.

118
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,800
This is the go to example.

119
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,640
Is that like if you think that human beings have a choice and what they did was wrong and

120
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,280
they did it knowing that it was wrong and that they deserve to be punished for that, you

121
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,040
can build a kind of deterrent, sorry, not deterrent, a kind of retributive model for

122
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,720
justice and say, you know, bad people should go to jail because they deserve to be punished.

123
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,280
If you buy my view, right, it becomes much harder to make any sense of the idea that

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,680
people deserve to suffer in any kind of way and that if you're going to have a prison

125
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,000
system, which I still think you need in some form, you're going to have to base it on

126
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,760
rehabilitative kinds of principles, restorative kinds of principles, deterrent kinds of

127
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,120
principles rather than a retributive kind of system.

128
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,720
And that'll have implications for how you build that model, how cruel it is, you know,

129
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,640
what what things you allow your prisoners to do during the times that they are in prison,

130
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,560
stuff like that. So I think it definitely has real applied ethics downstream implications.

131
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,680
And on the personal level, a lot hinges.

132
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,200
A lot of us build our sense of I think all of us, whether we try to resist it some, but

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,120
like it's a natural feeling to build your sense of self on your accomplishments and

134
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,520
failures, that like these are the things that define you.

135
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,280
And so I think one reason that people are very uncomfortable with this idea that everything

136
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,760
is luck is that they feel like their sense of self slips away.

137
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,280
And it does. And like part of the reality of recognizing moral luck is recognizing that

138
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,600
there is no free will in a robust sense and with it no robust sense of the separate

139
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,800
self that deserves, you know, a bunch of accolades for doing the right thing.

140
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,480
So I think, yeah, it has lots and lots of implications.

141
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,320
So it's great that you mentioned free will, because I was actually wondering if there

142
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,560
really was a difference on the on a systematic argumentative level between the debate

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,720
on free will and determinism and moral luck.

144
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you think there is any significance?

145
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,480
I mean, I think they're all connected here, right?

146
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:31,400
I think what we're saying here is determinism is true and it's true for sentient beings

147
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,920
just as much as it's true for non sentient beings.

148
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,080
And as a result, moral luck is pervasive because luck is pervasive and we continue to

149
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,880
make moral judgments.

150
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,920
So this is a fundamental problem and it is a problem because human beings don't have

151
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,960
free will in the robust kind of sense that we want to think that they do, that you're

152
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,760
not you're just not the author of your actions in the way that would be necessary for it

153
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,080
to be true that you did something wrong in a way that was that was radically independent

154
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,960
and so should be punished in a retributive kind of way.

155
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,040
OK, because to me it was kind of confusing, because when you take a look at the

156
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,680
arguments, how determinism works and how moral luck works, they seem to me to work

157
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,520
on two different different levels.

158
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,080
Determinism is trying to argue from the position of the thing in itself.

159
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,480
If you would like to make this distinction and moral luck is more arguing from the first

160
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,960
person perspective, it seems to me, because luck seems to be a rather strange category

161
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,240
when it comes to determinism.

162
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,800
Mhm, well, so I think it's interesting that you bring that up, because the moral luck

163
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,360
paper that you read is in Nagel's book, Mortal Questions, and he sort of views the unifying

164
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,360
problem of that book, of which moral luck is one version of the problem, as an unresolvable

165
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,960
tension between the subjective way of seeing the world, the way of seeing the world from

166
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,560
our inside first person perspective and an objective account of the world.

167
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,240
The world is seen from the view from nowhere.

168
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,760
And basically the problem is, maybe debatably, from our subjective point of view, we can't

169
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,120
help but see ourselves as free.

170
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,840
Actually, I don't fully believe that, but I think Nagel probably did, or he says that

171
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,880
he does at the end of moral luck.

172
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,560
And so some folks are really concerned that there's no livable way to fully deny the

173
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,840
idea of free will, to deny the idea of the independent, subjectively experiencing self,

174
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,680
to reduce it down to the purely objective.

175
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,360
And I think there are ways in which they're correct about that with regard to phenomenal

176
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,760
consciousness, but not with regard to free will.

177
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,880
I think that the reality is, we are just parts of the large, radically interconnected

178
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,600
system of causal events.

179
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Now, I want to also address your point in terms of unpacking a little bit more the features

180
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,200
of moral luck that Nagel puts forward, because you're right that some of them aren't put

181
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,080
in this necessarily strictly determinist way, though I think that they are just sort of

182
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,880
unpacking forms of determinism.

183
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,040
So he lays out four different kinds of luck.

184
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,920
He talks about luck of consequences, luck of how your actions turn out, right?

185
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:46,600
He talks about luck of circumstances, what situations that you are facing in your life.

186
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,560
He talks about luck of constitution, which I think is the most important one that he

187
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
talks about.

188
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,840
And that's the one that really undermines free will in a robust sense.

189
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,400
And then that's the luck of what makes you who you are, what the features that you happen

190
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,760
to have.

191
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,560
And then there's a fourth one, which often gets dropped out because it's probably exhaustively

192
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,920
accounted for by the other ones, which is essentially the luck of antecedent circumstances,

193
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,560
which is to say, you know, every events are the result of prior events.

194
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,680
And so that one is basically just determinism, right?

195
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,160
It's just saying, you know, we are part of the deterministic framework.

196
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,000
But the value of his argument is the unpacking of that in terms of the nature of constitutive

197
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,240
luck and how it erases any room for an independent, freely acting self.

198
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,600
OK, so you already answered the question of different types.

199
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
No problem.

200
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,520
I think it's good that there's a dynamic in this discussion.

201
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Do you yourself think that there are any epistemic problems, any serious epistemic

202
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,120
problems with this position?

203
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,880
Well, yes and no, I guess is my answer to that question, right?

204
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,200
I think there are massive epistemic problems whenever you're talking about conscious

205
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,040
sentient beings and what they are experiencing or not experiencing.

206
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,440
I don't. So like, I've been wrestling myself with this question of do I have, you know,

207
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,480
like I can tell you, I believe that I am not a free agent, right?

208
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,200
I do not have free will, but I'm mouthing those words to you.

209
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,120
Do I know that I actually believe that or is there some part of me that still clings

210
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,440
to the idea that I am actually free?

211
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,840
There are some people who will argue that, like, I am committed in every action to

212
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,600
still believing that I am free in some kind of way.

213
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,440
I don't necessarily think that's true from a logical argumentative side.

214
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,120
But there's also the psychological question of, you know, am I still clinging to this

215
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,400
habituated idea that I am a free, separate entity when I go around continuing to

216
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,040
enact behaviors that, you know, are things like praising and blaming other people?

217
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,840
Because I will still go around and say, you know, great job for doing that other thing,

218
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,600
right? I think that I can make a sense, reasonably explain why I'm doing that

219
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
without appealing to personal freedom.

220
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,680
But it is a habit that is associated with that.

221
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,040
And so, you know, we are creatures of habit.

222
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,000
That's part of the whole argument here.

223
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,120
So, like, it may just be part of my luck that I will continue to always believe that

224
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm free, even when I have solid arguments, I think that I am not.

225
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,560
If that were true, that would be really unfortunate, right?

226
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,280
Because that's like saying you're stuck believing false things that you know are

227
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
false, which we hope is not the case.

228
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,560
But that could be the bad luck that a person has.

229
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,520
And I'm not even sure how I prove either to myself or to other people that I genuinely

230
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,360
have adopted this belief.

231
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,400
So, like, that's about as big an epistemic problem as that you can get, right?

232
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,320
You don't even know if you're holding a belief or whether you can prove it to yourself

233
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,200
or anyone. I think that, like, I have reasonably good reasons to think that I have

234
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,880
adopted the no control, no free will view.

235
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm not convinced that I have any good way to convey that to anyone else in a convincing

236
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,000
fashion if they don't sort of also buy my no free will view and then sort

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,600
of infer that I'm really genuinely believing it.

238
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,360
So that's that's one major problem, right?

239
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,080
I guess, you know, other problems are, of course, I can't prove that none of you are

240
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
free and it's not just me that's the freak here.

241
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,960
Right. That's that's another major problem here.

242
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,000
But like, I think the argument is sound.

243
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,000
Like, I think there's there's no way to point to anything that anyone does that

244
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,920
isn't incredibly coded in luck and just luck all the way through.

245
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,080
Would you then agree that you have to presuppose certain positions concerning,

246
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,840
for example, the construction of reality?

247
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:24,600
How how reality at its base is built some ontological presuppositions for that?

248
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,200
I mean, so I guess it's possible just on the topic of sorry, sorry.

249
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,360
Just on the topic, for example, of of the philosophy of science, for example,

250
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,320
because for me it's just like most deterministic accounts nowadays.

251
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,680
It really sounds like an argument from the point of view of science or something

252
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,280
that is approaching science methodologically.

253
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Well, I think it is. Yeah, I mean, I think it is an argument bolstered by

254
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,520
empirical evidence, but I also think that it's it's an argument that can be done

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
without appeals to science would be my I mean, like, I think you could give a

256
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,240
philosophical argument that isn't empirical in nature or fundamentally

257
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,120
empirical in nature. Maybe it's a synthetic a priori kind of thing.

258
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,000
But like, I think it's I think it is the case that we have an argument for this

259
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,520
that isn't just assuming certain things about the nature of reality any more

260
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,680
than like any other argument is right.

261
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,360
Like, I think you can have radical skeptical concerns about all our beliefs.

262
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,600
Like, if if the universe turns out to just not be a consistently behaving thing,

263
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
then like everything is out the window.

264
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,440
But like, I think we have good reason to think that the universe behaves

265
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,960
according to consistent patterns and that determinism is the view that like

266
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:05,960
those consistent patterns involve some sorts of stable relations between things

267
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,600
and that once you have that, the problems arise pretty much immediately.

268
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,040
So I don't I don't think that it's presupposing anything that is implausible.

269
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,760
I think it's presupposing things that are essential for the universe as we

270
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,880
experience it being the way that we experience it in a Kantian kind of sense.

271
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:35,520
OK. So to take a step back for everyone who's who's listening and who's trying

272
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,440
to get into the topic, where should one start to read, for example?

273
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,920
Yeah, so I would start with the Nagel paper.

274
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,640
I think Thomas Nagel's Moral Luck paper is and you can get it.

275
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,360
It's easy to find Google online.

276
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,880
It's short. It's a little it's a little hard language.

277
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,000
It's not the easiest philosophy language ever, but it's also not the hardest

278
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,840
philosophy language either.

279
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,120
And I think that some of his prose are quite eloquent in laying out the problem,

280
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,640
especially like the parts about two thirds of the way through, where he talks

281
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,560
about how when you really take into account constitutive luck and how everything

282
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,960
about you is the result of factors beyond your control and therefore every action

283
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,800
that you engage in is the result of factors beyond your control.

284
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,800
He talks about how this shrinks the space of the self to an extensionless point.

285
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,320
And I think that that's a really beautiful way of describing how the problem works.

286
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,480
So I think the Nagel paper is really good.

287
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,600
And then, you know, there's various kinds of analysis of this, but I don't I don't

288
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,480
think that anyone has really resolved the problem that he lays out in that

289
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
particular paper.

290
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,520
So I think you mentioned, right, you went and read the paper before that, which is

291
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,600
the Williams paper, which I think is good, but I don't think goes as far as the

292
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Nagel paper. And then sorry.

293
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,200
Absolutely. I totally agree.

294
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,120
Yeah. And then there's like one or two individuals whose I'm blanking on the

295
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,240
names, but I can get you for the show notes if you want, who've written like

296
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,640
books about luck who take, I think, different views than me generally in terms

297
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,640
of trying to find, trying to find a way to claim that everything isn't the result

298
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,040
of luck rather than biting the bullet the way that I do.

299
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,680
I don't know of anyone who's out there who's really willing to go.

300
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,600
I don't know. I don't know of a lot of people out there who are going as all in

301
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,160
as I am on on this particular side of things.

302
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm sure there are people out there who do take a similar view, though.

303
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Okay, great. Yeah, would would be absolutely great if you can could send me

304
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,800
those names.

305
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,360
Okay, so I just have something left.

306
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:14,320
I found a definition of luck on the topic that I thought was fairly interesting,

307
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
and I wanted to hear your opinion on it.

308
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Maybe you have already heard of it, maybe not from, I hope I pronounce this name

309
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,360
correctly, Nicholas Reschers.

310
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,440
Mhm.

311
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
And I summarize it like this.

312
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Something is luck when it is the result of an unplanned event or that the result

313
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,600
itself is unexpected, plus the result has a significant evaluative status in

314
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,480
representing a good or bad result.

315
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,920
So in terms of a benefit or a loss.

316
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,760
Yes, there's a couple of features in there.

317
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
So let's go back to it one more time, just real slow.

318
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,320
And I just want to take a part.

319
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,000
Something is luck when it is the result of an unplanned event or that the result

320
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,240
itself is unexpected, plus the results.

321
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,920
Let's hold there for one second, right?

322
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,760
So so I don't know if he's going to say that we need all of these features, but

323
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm not sure why either I'm not convinced that either of those features is

324
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,200
necessarily essential for luck.

325
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,720
So like, I think that an event that is planned can still be the result of luck

326
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,640
if the planning process is itself tainted by luck in a, in a sufficient kind of way,

327
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,480
or if the mechanism that is then enacted, right?

328
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,960
So if I plan to roll a die, right, the die result is still the result of luck, it

329
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,880
seems like to me.

330
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah, and your decision to roll the die also and so on and so on.

331
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,640
Right.

332
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,160
And predictability seems to also, I think, be a bit of a red herring here in the

333
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,920
sense that, you know, I think there can be incredibly predictable events that are

334
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,080
still the result of factors beyond anyone's control and so fall into the kind

335
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,600
of luck that I have in mind here, right?

336
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,720
I think your yours and my behavior can be predictable and still the result of luck.

337
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,840
So I'm not convinced that that one makes sense either as a necessary condition.

338
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,920
So all right, go ahead, go ahead.

339
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,200
Why don't you do the other half of it?

340
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,320
So yeah, plus the result has a significant evaluative status in

341
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,200
representing a good or bad result.

342
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,480
The result has a significant evaluative status.

343
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm not sure exactly what he means there.

344
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,480
I guess I would need like an example to think about what, what he's trying to

345
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,680
get at with that particular.

346
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,960
If something happened, some event took place and either it can be understood as a

347
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
benefit or a loss, I think that that would summarize it.

348
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,520
OK, I mean, yeah, I think, oh, I see.

349
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,040
So he's so the criteria that he's putting in there is for it to count as luck.

350
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,600
It has to be like a good thing or a bad thing essentially.

351
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,880
Yeah, and you have to be able to evaluate it.

352
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,160
I think that that is also very important.

353
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,320
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure that's necessarily true either, right?

354
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,320
So either it's the case that everything is a good thing or a bad thing, in which case

355
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,600
what he's saying is tautologically true, right?

356
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,920
It isn't adding anything to the definition or if there are neutral events out there in

357
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,920
the world, events that are neither good nor bad, I don't see why they would be any

358
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:25,040
less the result of determinism and therefore any less the result of luck than like it

359
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,840
seems like the sort of account of luck he's giving there is very similar to like an

360
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,000
anthropomorphic kind of like luck as it pertains to my specific desired outcomes

361
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,080
and goals, whereas I think my definition of luck is a much thinner, you know, anything

362
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,760
that is beyond one's control, where that's important because what is beyond one's

363
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,200
control then does have significant implications when we consider morality.

364
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,720
Yeah, OK, I think that those were very good points on this attempt of a definition.

365
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,280
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a hard thing to define and like there's tricky sort of weird

366
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,440
circularity things about that that I have to try to tease out in terms of what I say

367
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
when I say, you know, everything is the result of luck because everything is the result

368
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,160
of things beyond our control, where luck means, you know, sort of things beyond our control.

369
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,280
But I do think that it's that's the right way to unpack luck.

370
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,800
And I think Nagel makes a really good case for that as being sort of the right way to

371
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,240
understand this. When we are when we are keeping in the front of our mind, what is

372
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,760
at stake here in terms of judgments of morality and judgments about the nature of the self?

373
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,040
OK. I think we are almost done.

374
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,640
That went faster than I expected.

375
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Oh, that's no problem. If I may, if we have a little bit extra time.

376
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,720
Sure, we have a lot of extra time.

377
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,800
Yeah. Well, there's a there's a way that I try to make this argument to try to make it

378
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:08,080
compelling for folks who have, you know, who might be sort of skeptical about this,

379
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,520
because usually the response I get is something along the lines of everybody agrees that a

380
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,800
lot of things are the result of luck, but there's still a little part of you inside of you

381
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,680
somewhere that is still making decisions.

382
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,680
And that thing is somehow separate from in the right kinds of ways these endless chains

383
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,120
of luck. And that's where free will still exists.

384
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,960
That's where control still exists.

385
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,720
Right. There's this little person inside at the control panel kind of view.

386
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,520
So I want to try to make a case against that for folks who may be sort of sitting in that

387
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
particular place at the moment.

388
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,080
And the way I like to do this is via sort of a Socratic dialogue where I like to ask a

389
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,680
person I'm talking to, to give an example.

390
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,320
I don't know how convinced you are by my arguments at this point, but if you can remember

391
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,840
a time when you weren't convinced by them, if you are, what you would point to as something

392
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,800
in your life that is an action that you would say is beyond it was under your control,

393
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,600
right, that you would say you were you freely chose to do.

394
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:26,160
OK, so first I want to say that when I presuppose a certain conception of a self, then I absolutely

395
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,160
agree with you.

396
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:39,320
The way that I understand the self does not have this homunculi that is able to control

397
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:49,520
anything, but it leaves the possibility for an event that, how do you say, it overcomes the

398
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,640
strict determinism of the real.

399
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:08,240
But I would have to have to prepare the explanation for that, because it's not that easy.

400
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,040
For me to do this in English just spontaneously.

401
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,360
Sure, I understand.

402
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,240
But if you take this position, then I would absolutely agree with you.

403
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,040
So, but for the sake of my argument, for people who don't agree, is there an action that you

404
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,840
would point to as being the sort of thing that you think should be counted as an argument

405
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,120
against my position or evidence against my position?

406
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:51,400
OK, I can try to come up with one, but I think that the hypothetical person in this dialogue

407
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,480
could take any action as an example.

408
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,880
So let's say I bought three apples instead of two because I wanted to.

409
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:12,120
Mhm, yeah, so you're right that I think almost any action can be put forward.

410
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,920
And they usually, I think, actually get chunked into two categories.

411
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,560
The one you gave would be kind of the trivial category, right?

412
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:24,400
People think that like trivial small actions are independent in some kind of way.

413
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,720
And then the other would be like big momentous actions that they think that they spend a lot

414
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,000
of time deliberating on, for example, would be the other kind where they think that they

415
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
have some sort of control over them.

416
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,080
And so the way I push back on these kind of examples is I ask them to apply a kind of

417
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,760
regress to this, a regress of reasons where I ask them to think, you know, why did you

418
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,080
pick the three apples instead of the two apples?

419
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,280
For example, I saw a tweet by Matonia, which motivated me to buy more apples.

420
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,760
Right. So one account could be, you know, I can point to the thing that got me

421
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,320
thinking about having one more apple or something like that, right?

422
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,920
In which case the argument runs, you know, it was luck that you happened to see that

423
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,600
tweet versus not see that tweet, right?

424
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,760
It wasn't under your control in some kind of way.

425
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,800
And so that the the motivating causal force in your behavior was this thing that was

426
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,520
clearly beyond your control.

427
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,640
So that that seems to reduce that down to an example of not freedom in the sense that

428
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm talking about in my framework or right.

429
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,360
The other way this sometimes gets answered is, well, nothing caused it, right?

430
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,880
There was absolutely nothing where somebody will try to say there was there was no no

431
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,280
thing that that made me pick three instead of two.

432
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,920
It just happened. Right.

433
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,480
And there it seems like maybe we can call that free.

434
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,240
But I think I think the reality is that's still going to be a determined event.

435
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,160
You may not be able to point to what I wouldn't I wouldn't say that if nothing caused

436
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,120
that it would was really free.

437
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,560
Right. And we certainly wouldn't say it's an example of the kind of will that we have in

438
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,960
mind when we say free will.

439
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,520
Right. We we want our will to be driven by reasons and we don't want to claim that our

440
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,760
will is free merely because it can sometimes act, you know, with no reason whatsoever.

441
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Right. We want to be able to say our will has reasons.

442
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:32,200
But we chose those reasons and they are us and that we can have, you know, ownership

443
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,400
of those reasons.

444
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,000
So I don't I don't think that kind of, you know, I rose I raised my left hand side of

445
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,640
my right hand is going to be the kind of case that people want to hang their their free

446
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,720
will arguments on.

447
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,560
And I also think that they are pretty clearly still reducible to, you know, causal effects.

448
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,040
Right. If I ask someone, you know, prove to me that you have free will and they raise

449
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,080
their arm and say, you know, I proved it by raising my hand, I would say you you raised

450
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,440
your hand because you wanted some way to prove that I, you know, prove to me that you had

451
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,360
free will. And you in your mind, you were convinced that that would be sufficient evidence.

452
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,120
And so you did that action caused by trying to want to prove to me that you have free

453
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,240
will in that kind of way.

454
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,160
So these regress problems, I think, arise for all of our actions.

455
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,000
Right. The big momentous choices.

456
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,440
You can still ask, you know, what was your reason for doing this big momentous thing?

457
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,720
And they can, you know, if they give the reason, you can then say, well, what about you?

458
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,440
What about your constitutive luck made you such that you made you such that you were

459
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,240
susceptible to that reason and not all the other competing reasons?

460
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,200
Right. Let's say that you you saved someone's life at some point.

461
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,640
Right. Like what what caused you to do that kind of thing would be that you had been

462
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,480
habituated to be the sort of person who would dive into the water and swim and save

463
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
someone's life in that particular situation.

464
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,640
You were lucky enough to have the physical capacity to do that physical event in that

465
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,520
moment. All of these things come together to make it the case that you save that

466
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,240
person's life. And it's a good thing.

467
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,120
Right. It's morally good that you saved that person's life.

468
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,640
But ultimately all of the things that contributed to that event were things that

469
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,840
were beyond your control.

470
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,800
Hmm. Yeah, I only have one question for the first answer, because to me it sounds like

471
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,680
the functionalist description of the self, where you have an output and it doesn't

472
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,080
really matter what happened inside.

473
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,600
But you have an you have an input that doesn't really matter what happens inside.

474
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
And then you have an output.

475
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,520
So it's this chain of reactions where the internal state.

476
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Yeah, OK, sure.

477
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,040
No, I didn't know if you've heard that from talking about on the show before.

478
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,640
And that was why you were trying to poke at me with this.

479
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,880
And so, yeah, so here's what I'll say about that.

480
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,840
I it is similar to a functionalist account of the self and that they are both objective

481
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,040
accounts of the self rather than subjective.

482
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,040
But on my view, I don't think that this is incompatible with there being a phenomenal

483
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,840
self that exists and is part of these causal frameworks.

484
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,880
So usually when people think of a functionalist account of the self, they think of an

485
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,360
eliminativist account, functionalist account that says there is no, you know, robust

486
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,240
mental properties or something like that.

487
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,520
There is literally just the input output.

488
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,480
My view is sorry.

489
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,320
I just want to ask if you would then say that in your opinion, the phenomenal

490
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,840
consciousness has some form of causal power or if it just is part of the.

491
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,840
OK, yes, I reject epiphenomenalism.

492
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:00,520
I think I think that mental states or properties have some sort of causal impact.

493
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,440
And that's absolutely great.

494
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,880
We agree on that. Oh, yeah.

495
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,520
Yeah, no, I totally think that's the case.

496
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,320
My view is just the mental properties and states are just as much the result of luck

497
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,400
as the physical properties and states.

498
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
And so they are part of the causal chains.

499
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,040
So your beliefs, for example, right?

500
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,760
I think that your beliefs have and play an important role in how you act in your life.

501
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,680
And they are mental states that you possess.

502
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,960
But every belief you have is the result of luck.

503
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,120
Everything that you've come to believe is the result of the luck of your education,

504
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,920
the location that you were in, your dispositions with regard to like how much evidence

505
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,040
you personally feel you need in order to believe a thing or not believe a thing.

506
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,040
So, yeah, I think.

507
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Yeah, I think the functionalist account is not a sufficient account

508
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,800
if it's meant to replace or leave out the phenomenal side of things.

509
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,520
But the phenomenal side of things are not indeterminate.

510
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,120
They are part of the deterministic framework.

511
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
OK.

512
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,880
I adopt lots of very weird positions and then try to match them together, I suppose, to put this.

513
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,040
I don't think that it's really a weird position.

514
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,240
I think, actually, that's what a lot of functionalists are lacking.

515
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
I mean, it comes with cost is what I mean.

516
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,280
There's always, you know, like sure, but which position position doesn't.

517
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,000
Right, of course, except for trivialism.

518
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,960
Right. We could always be very trivialist about this.

519
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:36,560
And like, you know, I mean, I mean, do you know the epistemological position of trivialism?

520
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,400
Oh, no. What is that?

521
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,680
It's absolutely great. I love it.

522
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,400
It's that every proposition is true.

523
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
Hmm. Interesting.

524
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,960
So you can't really disagree with it because they will agree with you that it's wrong,

525
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,600
but it's still true because it's not true.

526
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,240
Oh, this is the bit from Fiddler on the Roof where it's like, oh, you're right.

527
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,560
You're right. Oh, and you're right.

528
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,160
You're right, too. Yeah, I know that joke.

529
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,800
Yeah, but it's a real position.

530
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,440
Yeah, I mean, real. I mean, I'm a discordian.

531
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,240
I think everything is true in some sense and false in some sense and meaningless in some sense.

532
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,760
And thanks for reminding me to read the Discordia Procipia.

533
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
Oh, yes. Right.

534
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,960
And so here's what I mean.

535
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,040
One of the things I will say about like the kind of quietest,

536
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,640
you know, unresolvability side of all of this that like,

537
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,440
you know, I don't think there's a solution here because I don't think that

538
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,640
our sense of self is really reconcilable with the reality as we understand it.

539
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,000
So I think the best thing to do is to try to jettison our sense of self

540
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,080
and replace it with a more sophisticated framework

541
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,920
that keeps front and center in our mind all of these,

542
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,360
however you think is the result of luck, because I don't think it changes our behavior

543
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:08,560
in terms of things like humility and how we approach others when they've done things wrong.

544
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,520
But it's always going to be an uneasy tension

545
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,440
because it's always going to be tricky to figure out how to

546
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,720
reinforce people in acting in better ways.

547
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,880
Because I like another part of this.

548
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,600
I do absolutely think that we should still change people's behavior

549
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,520
and think that we can change people's behavior.

550
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,280
And so the question is, how do we do that in a way that

551
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,360
isn't too like horrifyingly dystopian, right?

552
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,680
We still have to kind of respect their autonomy in sophisticated ways, even though.

553
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,480
So, you know, one way to read what I'm saying

554
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,800
would be to say that I've rejected the idea that humans have autonomy.

555
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,360
But I don't think that's the case.

556
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,680
I think that you have autonomy in a sense, in the sense of being able to hear

557
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,720
arguments and adopt different beliefs as a result of those arguments.

558
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Now, whether or not you adopt them is the result of luck.

559
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,280
But we should still respect individuals' freedom.

560
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,400
You know, we shouldn't try to brainwash you.

561
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,080
We should try to convince you, is basically what I'm saying, that there are more

562
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,600
or less coercive ways of approaching changing people's behavior.

563
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:22,640
And the reality of moral luck is not does not give us sort of carte blanche to go around

564
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,840
reprogramming people because we're all programmed to begin with, if that makes sense.

565
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,680
Yeah, absolutely, it does.

566
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I think if it's true, it would be

567
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,480
really good for everyone to adopt you.

568
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,720
I think it's really healthy.

569
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,480
I like this is why this is why I'm not sure if I actually believe it or not.

570
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,360
But I really do think that the more I've internalized this view, the more I'm able

571
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,480
to cope with bad things, the more like,

572
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,040
you know, when certain people do certain things.

573
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah, the more I can forgive.

574
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,520
And it's hard. Again, there's that there's that unrelenting tension of like,

575
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,320
I don't want this to become a view that means that no one has ever held

576
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,520
responsible for anything in any way.

577
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,840
I just think that we have to hold them responsible in the right way.

578
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,280
And with awareness of the factors

579
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,320
that made them engage in that particular kind of behavior.

580
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,480
And also on the on the personal side, that someone should be happy

581
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,720
if they do something that is something that they wanted to achieve.

582
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,680
Yeah, I mean, they take pleasure, right?

583
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Like crazy. You can't resist taking pleasure.

584
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,560
So like take some pleasure in the world.

585
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,680
And like, I don't think that luck undermines that at all, right?

586
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,480
Everything that I find pleasurable, I do as a result of luck, find it pleasurable.

587
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,960
But I still find it pleasurable.

588
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,120
Like, I still love having this conversation with you.

589
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,640
And like, you know, if we're stuck here, you might as well do the things

590
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
that are pleasurable up to a point, right?

591
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,840
There's moral obligations that get in the way

592
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,760
and you shouldn't always just do what's pleasurable.

593
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,360
So I think like none of this undermines the complexity

594
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,480
of moral judgments and like all of the competing factors

595
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,680
that go into making good moral decisions.

596
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,160
In fact, I think it just makes it harder.

597
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,040
It makes it more like you have to recognize that like you're going to spend

598
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,400
your whole life wrestling with moral tensions

599
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,920
and it's going to be a matter of luck how well you actually do.

600
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,240
And that that means that I think that you can like let yourself

601
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,400
off the hook a little bit more than some people do.

602
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,560
I think it's you know, I think a lot of ethics come down to correctives

603
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,120
that like if you if you are, you know, if you have the luck

604
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,920
of being the sort of person who lets yourself off the hook too much, do that less.

605
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,440
Right. And if you're the sort of person who, you know,

606
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,600
you know, beats yourself up for weeks on end, this is what this is.

607
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,160
Like why I became an ethicist is because I'm the sort of person who like

608
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,840
just, you know, kills myself over and over when I've done something

609
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,680
even minorly wrong to someone. I just like it makes me crazy.

610
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,320
And so like maybe I've adopted this as a corrective

611
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,480
for letting myself off the hook a little bit more.

612
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,480
They, you know, we always joke that like philosophers

613
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,360
are always always telling you more about themselves

614
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,200
than about the nature of the universe.

615
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,240
So maybe I'm just, you know, confessing to everyone

616
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,720
that I don't have free will and maybe all of you do so.

617
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,720
Yeah, but that wouldn't be really a problem, because in the end, as a solipsist, you.

618
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,200
Right, I'm the only one.

619
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,520
So the rest of you are just figments of my not free imagination.

620
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,920
It would actually be horrible if you would be a solipsist

621
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,600
who thinks that you are the only one who's determined.

622
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,040
I think you just described God.

623
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,320
I think that's pretty much how God works.

624
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,400
OK, great.

625
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,160
I do believe you all are real, though, if it makes you feel any better.

626
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,520
OK, when we when we are already talking about what's real and what not,

627
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,680
I hope you're aware that I have reappropriated your lightning round.

628
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,480
I am, and I approve of this.

629
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,080
All ideas are free for everyone.

630
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,400
And I modified it a bit.

631
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,360
I try I try to have less categories in the end, I had more.

632
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,600
It's hard, right?

633
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,760
Absolutely, especially because I have a big interest in psychoanalysis,

634
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,640
so I can't not ask certain things.

635
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,040
Every subset of the every subset of the psychological mind.

636
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,960
So how that works, at least from the Lacanian perspective.

637
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,520
And I don't know if you've caught this on the show, but I've

638
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,800
I've started adding a question at the beginning that I'm finding to be very useful.

639
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,400
I have, but I will not.

640
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,640
You're not going to ask that. Yeah.

641
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,680
OK, fair enough.

642
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,560
Do you think that it primes them?

643
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,880
I think it's useful, but I don't like doing useful things.

644
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,400
I mean, I think there are tradeoffs in doing it.

645
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,200
I think it changes their answers and maybe you want the answers to be different

646
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,680
or maybe you don't. So I think there's no there's no moral

647
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,640
fact of the matter about how to do the lightning round.

648
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,480
It's just luck.

649
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,040
OK, so I think every viewer is aware of how this works.

650
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,840
Just basically I will ask if something is real or not and.

651
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,760
You will answer whether or not you think it's real or not,

652
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,920
and you will not be able to explain what you mean by that.

653
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,600
And I promise that I've done prep work in this.

654
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,200
I'm shooting from the hip 100 percent.

655
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,040
Would have been hard, because some of them, I guess, you might

656
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,640
not really have thought about before.

657
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Here's hoping.

658
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,480
Is this the first time you have to suffer through this?

659
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,400
It is. This is a novel experience for me.

660
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,360
Absolutely great. I feel really honored.

661
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,600
Yeah, the torture implement is on the other foot.

662
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,160
OK, so let's start.

663
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,520
The first question would be, is the real lightning round

664
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,520
real?

665
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,600
Is the real real?

666
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,320
Yes, real.

667
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,480
So what about the symbolic order?

668
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,160
The sorry, the symbolic symbolic order.

669
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,600
Yeah, I think symbolic orders are real.

670
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,000
And the imaginary.

671
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,440
Yes.

672
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,560
OK, now a classic one, the external world.

673
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,720
Yes, real colors.

674
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,280
Honestly, not real.

675
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,840
OK, phenomenal consciousness, real, the self.

676
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,160
Not real gender.

677
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,400
Not real race.

678
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,120
Not real species.

679
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,920
Said I really I personally struggle with this with this line here, I.

680
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,080
I'm going to go with not real, not real.

681
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,160
OK, morality, real.

682
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,720
More luck, real, pervasive.

683
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,600
Rights, real.

684
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,760
Borders, borders.

685
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,440
Not real.

686
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,160
OK, knowledge, real.

687
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,880
God, gods or similar entities.

688
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,320
Not real society.

689
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,560
Real.

690
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,400
And just to throw your silence.

691
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,240
Real, yeah.

692
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,160
OK, fictional characters.

693
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,840
Pardon me, really doesn't want to say real.

694
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,200
Do I genuinely believe that they are real, though?

695
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,960
Yeah, I do. I think I do.

696
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,920
Yeah, sure, they're real.

697
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,640
Great. Holes.

698
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,480
Holes are real.

699
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,000
Great. Chess.

700
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,000
Chess like the game chess.

701
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,440
Chair. Oh, chairs, excuse me, chairs.

702
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,200
Chairs are sitting.

703
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,440
Yeah, chairs are not real.

704
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,760
OK, desks.

705
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,080
Desks are also not real.

706
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,800
Sandwiches.

707
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,560
Sandwiches are not real, definitely not real.

708
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,640
OK, science.

709
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,400
As far as I can tell, not well, I don't know if I think society is real.

710
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,680
Yeah, I think science is real.

711
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,840
OK, beauty.

712
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,600
I'm just going to be wildly inconsistent and say that it's real,

713
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,160
even though I said colors aren't real earlier, I'm doing it.

714
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,200
OK, that does not have to be necessarily.

715
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,520
I know, I know that it doesn't necessarily be inconsistent,

716
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,120
but my justifications for it are.

717
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,640
Yeah, linear time.

718
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,760
Linear time.

719
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,040
That's a hard one.

720
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,520
Honest, I'll say not real.

721
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,240
OK, the unconscious.

722
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,600
Real.

723
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,200
OK, unicorns.

724
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,200
Unicorns.

725
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,440
Is a subset of fictional characters?

726
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,240
Sure, yeah, real.

727
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Causality.

728
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Causality.

729
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Not real.

730
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Causality.

731
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Causality is real.

732
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Nothingness.

733
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Nothingness is real.

734
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
Yeah.

735
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Great.

736
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
And the last one would be crows.

737
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
Crows.

738
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
Not real.

739
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Oh, now I'm sad.

740
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,320
Oh, I still like you in a conventional sense.

741
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,320
I'm just talking like ultimately you're not real.

742
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
But it's OK, because ultimately I'm not real either.

743
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,320
So like it's not a slight against you, it's we're on the same boat.

744
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,320
But the problem is I'm now twice not real.

745
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,320
So myself not real and me being a crow.

746
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
That's very problematic.

747
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,320
But it makes you feel better, like I was just clearly wildly inconsistent

748
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,320
in my assessment, so like no one should take anything I say remotely seriously.

749
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:07,320
But would being two times not real not be like being real?

750
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
Oh, yeah.

751
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Like two negatives canceling each other out?

752
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
Yeah, I'd buy that.

753
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
It's like horseshoe theory.

754
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
You circle all the way back around to being real.

755
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,400
I'm so not real that I'm real again.

756
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Horseshoe theory of ontology.

757
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Retro-real.

758
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
OK, great.

759
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
That's it.

760
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
Thank you for taking the time.

761
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,400
No problem.

762
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,400
Thank you for having me on.

763
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,400
I always love chatting about moral luck and how absurd reality is.

764
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,480
OK.

765
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,480
Man spricht generell über moralisches Glück,

766
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,480
wenn jemand, der handelt, als moralischer Akteur bewertet wird,

767
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,480
obwohl ein signifikanter Teil seines Handelns

768
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,480
von Faktoren außerhalb seines Einflusses beeinflusst oder bewirkt wird.

769
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Dieser Umstand wirft die Frage auf,

770
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,480
inwiefern man jemanden für sein Handeln bewerten kann und sollte.

771
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,560
Je nachdem, wie ernst man das Thema moralisches Glück nimmt,

772
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,560
ist niemand mehr als gut oder schlecht zu bewerten,

773
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,560
da die Person nichts für das Handeln kann.

774
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,560
Diese gesamte Argumentationslinie erinnert an Diskussionen

775
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,560
über freien Willen und Determinismus.

776
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,560
Wie in dieser Diskussion ist auch hier die Position

777
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,560
eines harten moralischen Glücks schwer im eigenen Leben umzusetzen.

778
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Thomas Nagel hat in seinem einflussreichen Artikel über moral luck

779
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,640
vier Arten von moralischem Glück herausgearbeitet.

780
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Erstens, resultierendes Glück.

781
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,640
Über resultierendes Glück spricht man,

782
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,640
wenn alles außer dem Resultat der Handlung gleich ist,

783
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,640
also die Intention, die Vorbereitung und so weiter.

784
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,640
Und dieses Resultat Produkt von Glück ist.

785
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Zum Beispiel, wenn zwei Personen betrunken nach Hause fahren

786
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,640
und einer von beiden bringt dadurch einen Menschen um.

787
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Wir sollten verstehen, dass es sich dabei nur um resultierendes Glück handelt

788
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,720
und beide gleich bewerten.

789
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,720
Zweitens, das den Umständen verschuldete Glück.

790
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,720
Hierüber spricht man, wenn die äußeren Umstände

791
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,720
das moralische Handeln signifikant beeinflussen.

792
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,720
Ein Beispiel dafür sind die Menschen,

793
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,720
die in Deutschland mit den herrschenden Nazis kollaborierten,

794
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,720
es aber, während sie vorher ausgewandert, nicht getan hätten.

795
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,720
Wenn diese Unterscheidung im Verhalten auftauchen würde,

796
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,720
haben wir es mit dem, den Umständen verschuldeten Glück zu tun.

797
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,800
Drittens, konstitutives Glück.

798
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,800
Hierbei geht es darum, mit welchen Eigenschaften und Dispositionen

799
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,800
jemand ins Leben kommt und aufwächst.

800
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
Diese Art des moralischen Glücks ist insbesondere

801
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,800
im politischen Kontext äußerst relevant,

802
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,800
da man hierüber aus einem anderen Blickwinkel über Themen

803
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,800
wie Umverteilung, Privilegien usw. diskutieren kann.

804
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,800
Viertens, kausales Glück.

805
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,800
Dabei geht es darum, wie jemand durch vorherige Umstände

806
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,880
Determiniert wurde.

807
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,880
Für weitere Informationen, die tiefer gehen bezüglich dieses Themas

808
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,880
und neue Einsichten und Kritik vorstellen,

809
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,880
kann ich das Buch Moral Luck, editiert von Daniel Stedman, vorschlagen.

810
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Es beinhaltet sowohl die klassischen Essays

811
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,880
als auch neuere zu diesem Thema.

812
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,880
Ich hoffe, die Episode hat euch gefallen.

813
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,880
Wenn ja, dann gebt doch eine Rückmeldung.

814
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,880
Ansonsten wünsche ich euch noch einen schönen Tag.

815
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,960
Tschüss.
