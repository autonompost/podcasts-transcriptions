1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Yeah, no, I'm absolutely not going to do this intro in English, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,420
If you want to listen to my special zombie episode intro, go to the German version and

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,520
suffer through the first 20 seconds and then come back.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,100
It really hurt my throat and I'm absolutely not going to do this again.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm really sorry.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,120
Maybe, I guess.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:43,600
Okay, so hello and welcome to the very first English episode of the Corvus Corax podcast.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:53,640
The topic of today is the zombie, especially in the context of philosophy and yes, first

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,920
Let me introduce myself a bit.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,440
I'm a German podcast host.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,480
I've been doing podcasts for about a year now.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:13,120
I've been doing videos on YouTube generally for seven years now and my wife has been bugging

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,880
me to do these podcasts in English too because she thinks my English is quite good and I

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,280
think she's making a great mistake in her judgment there, but I guess I've decided to

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,120
do this anyways.

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,920
So yeah, there we are, okay.

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
There's a tradition in the German version of the podcast where I tell you what I drink

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,360
and the drink that I drink, the beverage has to be a different one every episode.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,640
If there's any sponsor out there, this is the only sponsorship I'd accept, beverages.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,760
Today I'm drinking a wild berry tea.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,560
I don't know if you translate it that way, it's a tea I got from my local tea shop.

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,080
Anyways, so okay, zombies, what's up with that?

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,760
Let us take a look at the history of the modern image of the zombie.

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,240
One can find the origin of the image of the zombie when one takes a look at the American

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,480
military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,020
There a legend was persisting through these few strange decades that voodoo magicians

27
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,020
were able to resurrect a body and make it work endlessly.

28
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,900
You have to imagine the zombie happy as Camus probably used to say in an alternate universe,

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,680
I guess.

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,720
As the news of this legend reached America, the interest in it was growing rapidly in

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,340
its popular culture.

32
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,140
This specifically occult image of the zombie rots away and dissolves at a certain point

33
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:16,940
in the 1970s, which can be traced to the release of a certain movie, George A. Romero's 1968

34
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,500
released movie, Night of the Living Dead, in which the word zombie ironically never appeared

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
not even once.

36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,100
Following the discussions of the last few decades in the philosophy of mind, one will

37
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,100
be aware of the fact that the zombie even creeped in here through David Chalmers' influential

38
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,660
essay.

39
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,620
When it comes to the philosophical zombie, it is usually about the critique of physicalism

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,420
and or functionalism.

41
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,860
At the center of this criticism lies the term qualia.

42
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:57,660
Qualia means something like how it is, that is, a qualitative experience.

43
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,640
The functionalist tries to reduce human consciousness to a number of functions.

44
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,540
Take as an example a beverage machine.

45
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:14,740
You throw a coin into the machine, this changes its internal status from x1 to x2 and it responds

46
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,440
according to the input, which has influenced its internal status.

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,980
How and what exactly happens with this internal status and how it is for the beverage machine

48
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,900
does not matter, since the entire work of the machine is described by its function.

49
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,100
Whether gears are working or a ferry uses its magic in the interior, which set the machine

50
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,540
in motion, does not really matter, as long as the machine reacts accordingly.

51
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,020
The same should also be the case with consciousness, only more complex.

52
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,300
We get an input, our internal state changes accordingly and we give a response corresponding

53
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,980
to our new internal state, an output determined by the state.

54
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,220
Here comes the criticism of the philosophical zombie.

55
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:17,300
If functionalism is true, then the qualitative experience would have to be irrelevant to

56
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,340
the function.

57
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,220
Accordingly philosophical zombies would have to be conceivable.

58
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:30,780
Of course my explanation is not but a caricature and we should actually be discussing possible

59
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,100
the meaning of conceivability in a metaphysical or even ontological context and so on and

60
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,220
so forth, but I just wanted to utilize this thought experiment to establish the following

61
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,060
assumption.

62
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,660
Consciousness sets us humans apart from zombies.

63
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,220
Of course this assumption is extremely problematic, because we do not know exactly how to handle

64
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,220
it.

65
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,380
How do I know now that my counterpart is not a philosophical zombie?

66
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:10,460
If the output of his function process are similar or alike, the genuinely human one,

67
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,060
how could I tell them apart?

68
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,660
Here the zombie of popular culture can help us.

69
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,340
For in stories which are about the fact that someone is in the process of transformation

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,660
into a zombie, a special aspect of zombie-ing is highlighted.

71
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,580
Zombie-ing is expressed by an increasing loss of self-control.

72
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,500
For this reason there are some zombie movies or books or games in which a character from

73
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,540
a romantic couple becomes a zombie and wants to die rather than survive death and kill

74
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,820
the partner as a will-liberated zombie-ing.

75
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,700
They don't want to turn into an ungetÃ¼m, as one might say.

76
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,980
This also clarifies why being undead is something bad for the living.

77
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:09,020
However, the question is not answered whether being undead is bad in itself for the undead.

78
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,620
Let's take a look at why death is considered bad, because it's the step in between.

79
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,020
One of the most common strategies in this regard is a desire-frustration theory.

80
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,540
We rate the rejection of something wanted as bad.

81
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:35,440
And because death frustrates our desires in general, it's something that we should work

82
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,020
our way around.

83
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,520
However, this is not a good argument as to why it is bad for the zombie to be undead.

84
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,160
It may even be that he has a craving for human flesh and brain, and the satisfaction

85
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,960
of this in the sense even speaks for the undead being, for the zombie-ing.

86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,160
It's an argument for his existence in this specific mode.

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,400
If we are already on this hedonistic, utilitarian ground, we could paraphrase John Stuart Mill

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,160
here and say that it is better to be a corpse than a satisfied undead, since his cravings

89
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,640
are of a very low quality and the zombie is not in the condition to perform higher

90
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,880
quality cognitive operations.

91
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,660
Here comes an example to mind which Zizek uses to explain his understanding of dialectics.

92
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,440
The dialectical movement of Zizek takes place through the negation of the negation, which

93
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
reflects the synthesis.

94
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,160
However, according to Zizek, the negation of the negation is not a return to the thesis,

95
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,280
not a minus, a minus equals plus, but the break with the meaning-giving framework which

96
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,480
makes the tension between thesis and antithesis possible in the first place.

97
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,040
His example is to understand living as the thesis and death as the antithesis, whereupon

98
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,000
the negation of the negation follows in the undead.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,560
The zombie is not alive nor dead, he negates the meaning-giving framework.

100
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,800
Here, however, I would like to draw attention to a weak spot that struck me while reading

101
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,440
Hartwig Schmid's work on nichts und Zeit in English Nothingness and Time.

102
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,320
Zizek's negation of the negation is really just a pageration of the negation.

103
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,240
Pageration is the meaning of the prefix un.

104
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,680
For example, if we say that a person is, and I now have to use a different word, inhumane

105
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,800
in German it's unmenschlich, then we do not doubt his material constitution descriptively,

106
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,680
but say that there is a norm that belongs to the concept of humanity and that this norm

107
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
has been broken.

108
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,640
Pageration is the breach of or an underlying norm.

109
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,680
In the case of the undead, it is his unrestrained instinctual drive, his lack of awareness,

110
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,720
and his lack of socio-sexuality that makes up the core of this subversive tendency.

111
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,760
If an undead stood in front of a person who was able to enter into an intimate relationship

112
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,120
with people, had consciousness, and could control his instincts, then he would lose

113
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,680
his rank as an undead in the consciousness of the person.

114
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,320
Well, maybe except for his looks, that might be a distracting factor, I guess.

115
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,640
That's actually why this look is used a lot in Hollywood movies.

116
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,560
How would you distinguish between complex, human-like zombies and humans if it weren't

117
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,740
for this look, you zombie-phobe?

118
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,960
To break it down perhaps a little differently, what distinguishes a person from a zombie

119
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,600
cannot be determined on one level by a single ism.

120
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,120
Functionalistic, phenomenological, and behavioristic observations are needed to clearly state the

121
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,800
difference between human and zombie.

122
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,180
Here we also arrive at a problem of the debate around the philosophical zombie.

123
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,640
The question of whether we can imagine a philosophical zombie is based on an impossibility, for to

124
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:27,620
imagine what it is like to be a consciousness-free body is not possible due to the a priori

125
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,160
necessity of consciousness for this mental act.

126
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,520
Furthermore, these debates often ignore the fact that self-being and social identity are

127
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,640
related.

128
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,780
Absolute antisocial self-being is unthinkable from birth onwards due to the inevitable

129
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,620
interdependence of human life.

130
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,540
Furthermore, the self needs to be aware of an other and the social context to create

131
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,780
an identity, at least in the psychoanalytical and sociological sense.

132
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,380
Now, one of the main characters or a person who is important to the protagonist becomes

133
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
a zombie.

134
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,600
Now, as Lenin would have put it, what is to be done?

135
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,200
The solution is kill the zombie.

136
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Even if it takes a lot of emotional work to be able to do so, just get rid of him.

137
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,080
But why is it still easier for us to kill a zombie than a human?

138
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,760
Here I'd like to discuss the question of the value of a zombie.

139
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,820
What could be the central factor of zombie-ing that makes it less valuable relative to humans?

140
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,180
Is it the terrible acts that it commits?

141
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,580
For some, yes.

142
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,020
But for most, no.

143
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,780
Most are against the death penalty, even in cases of serious crimes.

144
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,740
Is it the absence or severe limitation of the zombie's mental performance?

145
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
For some, yes.

146
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,980
But for most, no.

147
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,500
Most people would not consider the murder of someone who has lost their consciousness,

148
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,820
who has a mental disability or the like, to be morally defensible.

149
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,380
Incidentally, this is an argument often made in the vegan debate.

150
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,740
So why kill zombies?

151
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,940
Maybe you should ask yourself why he does not or should kill zombies, I don't know.

152
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,380
Maybe it's changing the identity of the person, the emergence of a different identity.

153
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,660
Perhaps we justify it by either no longer being obliged to the previous identity in

154
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:42,620
the sense of a contract theory, or else we are acting out of an obligation to the pre-zombie

155
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,020
identity of the person.

156
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,220
Both things could be a possibility, but is it really a different identity we're talking

157
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,580
about?

158
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,980
We assume that the zombie's brain no longer works as before, but how much of the brain

159
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,500
must stop functioning, or functioning in the same way as before, before we speak of another

160
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
person?

161
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,940
Like at the end of Shaun of the Dead, we somehow get the murderer's tendencies under control.

162
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,380
Isn't it still the same person we're playing video games with?

163
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,180
To go the way through the brain death criterion, to declare the undead as dead, is one possibility,

164
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,940
but the undead breaks the life-death dichotomy by his actions, which is why this attempt

165
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,340
would be utterly futile.

166
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,780
So in order to propose an understanding of the self, which knows no hard limits, but

167
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:35,260
allows more transitions and blurring, we abandon the essentialist approach and see

168
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,140
the self as some kind of fiction.

169
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:48,380
With Hume and Parfit, we can understand the self as the existence of a psychological continuity.

170
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,620
To put it in a nutshell, if there will be one future person who will have enough of

171
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:01,020
my brain to be psychologically continuous with me, that person would be me.

172
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,700
As Parfit writes,

173
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,540
Imagine being decomposed at a teleporter to your atoms and reconstructed at the other

174
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,540
end.

175
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,220
Then one actually died, but is not dead, since the reconstruction possesses the psychological

176
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,900
continuity of the previous self.

177
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,780
If we approach the matter from this framework, then we can say that regardless of the state

178
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:33,380
of the brain, the zombies are not identical to their previous self, since their purpose

179
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,180
in life has fundamentally changed.

180
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,180
At least in most cases, there certainly are humans that like to eat human meat, and they

181
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,180
can be fairly nice, I guess, at least according to Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

182
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:54,340
Anyways, their purpose in life has changed, because their lives are now limited, aimed

183
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,380
at the goal of eating human flesh.

184
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,180
That's the limit of it.

185
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,860
However, we encounter problems here as well.

186
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,420
For example, what about a situation in which someone was indoctrinated by some sect and

187
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,860
now thinks he is reborn?

188
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,820
Do we lose our previous duties to this person?

189
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,260
For example, don't we still owe him any money?

190
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:21,700
So if I owe someone money, should I just send him to some kind of church and let him be

191
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,100
indoctrinated and then I don't owe him any money anymore?

192
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,620
This realization seems rather bizarre.

193
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,340
A look at Sean for the Dead may help us here again.

194
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:37,980
In our everyday lives, we perform some actions as in an automatism.

195
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,180
In these situations, functionalism seems to succeed.

196
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,180
However, it is our ability to plan for the future and to consciously adapt our actions

197
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:53,220
accordingly, the brief moments of everyday clarity that distinguish us from the zombie.

198
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,860
If we look at Sean, then for the first time in a long time, he had made the decision for

199
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,220
the future and forged a plan.

200
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:13,860
First they go to his mother's house and pick them up, take care of the zombified father,

201
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,340
drive to his ex-girlfriend's house and drink tea at hers.

202
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:24,660
The second plan, because the story progresses and things don't go exactly how they would

203
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:31,020
like it to be, is to drive to the house of the mother, take care of the zombified stepfather,

204
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,140
pick up the eggs and drive back to his place for a cup of tea.

205
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,500
And the third plan was to drive to the mother's house, get the mother, take the stepfather

206
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,780
down, get the eggs and go to the pub and drink until it's all over, which seems to be the

207
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,460
best plan of all three.

208
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:52,540
At the end of the movie, Sean's girlfriend says in reference to the fact that it was

209
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:59,980
not the plan itself and his choice of what to do that was important, but that he had

210
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,900
even made a decision and tried to make it a reality.

211
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,340
And this might be something that some people who are interested in politics should take

212
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:18,940
a look at, at least around here in Germany.

213
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:25,940
One might think of Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of transcendence, which lies at the core of

214
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,460
human freedom, at least for him.

215
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,740
What makes man free is his ability to think of oneself in the future, that is to transcend,

216
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,340
to act on this image of the future.

217
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,020
Even if we accept the factor of transcendence, we have not covered every form of zombie.

218
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,860
However, it should be clear how stimulating thinking about zombies can be.

219
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,020
In the end, I cannot tell you how you should act toward a zombie.

220
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,700
Self-defense is probably okay, I guess.

221
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,620
I don't even have my own theory of personality that could satisfy me, especially the diversity

222
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,900
of the zombie makes it all the more difficult.

223
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:14,860
Here is a list, very incomplete, of things one should keep in mind when attempting to

224
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,100
write seriously about zombies.

225
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,940
Zombies do not exist.

226
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,540
Zombies are not related to werewolves or vampires.

227
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:30,300
Zombies are not, literally, mindless consumers, enraged proletarians or stupid Americans,

228
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,660
although some were probably once these things.

229
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,660
And there is little use in casting them, even metaphorically, as essentially such,

230
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,860
especially when attempting to offer a theory of zombies.

231
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,760
This is because zombies do not form a natural kind, not even a fictional natural kind.

232
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:57,020
Within the genre, zombies vary greatly in behavior, cognitive power and athletic ability.

233
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,620
Some shamble, some run at or near Olympic speeds, some are incapable of manipulating

234
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,920
even simple objects, others play video games with erstwhile friends, some behave better,

235
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,700
at least not worse than the living, others are Nazis, some are created by ill-advised

236
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,380
government programs, others by hearing Canadian English.

237
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,540
All of this makes it difficult and likely a colossal waste of time to make grand general

238
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,220
pronouncements on the nature of the living dead, the interests they hold for us or their

239
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,580
basic cultural significance, which is just as well, since I do not have a theory of zombies.

240
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,540
In fact, my claim is that zombies can offer a particular kind of philosophical and aesthetic

241
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:45,020
reward precisely when we do not know just what they are, what animates them or what

242
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,100
it amounts to when we get to work killing them.

243
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,660
Self-defense notwithstanding.

244
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,180
One could end this episode here, but I am not finished yet.

245
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,500
Of course, the zombie also has a political meaning.

246
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,020
In some zombie movies, series and games, children and adolescents also live in the zombified

247
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,140
world.

248
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,260
They cannot imagine a world that would be worth recreating, since they grew up in the

249
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,080
zombified world.

250
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,780
And I think we can glean some interesting insights into today's political situation

251
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,900
from Peter Sloterdijk's critique of cynical reason and Slava Zizek's sublime object.

252
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,220
For these children, the desire of adults to reclaim a world that is worthy of being recreated

253
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:44,700
with their ancient traditions, their understanding of family, work, etc. is a pure ideology.

254
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,500
One of Sloterdijk's key ideas is that it has to get better before something sensitive

255
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,000
can be learned.

256
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,080
The consequence of this is that our learning today is not designed to solve the problems

257
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,840
of the future, it rather creates them.

258
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,220
In both Zizek's pure ideology and Sloterdijk's false consciousness of the Enlightenment,

259
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,800
we find a leitmotif.

260
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:15,200
The previous tries to reproduce in a world that exposes the past as a sham, resulting

261
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,480
in the generation zombie, for whom this quasi-utopian world loses all credibility.

262
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,840
This aimlessness provides the breeding ground for a world in which everyone becomes a zombie

263
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,720
more and more without wanting to, but also without a way out.

264
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
The end of history is the beginning of the zombified world.

265
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,380
It's not so much the often vilified social media that turns people into zombies, it is

266
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,820
much more the participation in the ideological carnival and the neoliberal straightjacket

267
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:56,020
of the bourgeois, who seeks protection in an unreflected illusory centrism and dives

268
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,140
into his supposedly apolitical everyday life.

269
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,100
So what do I really want to say in the end of it all?

270
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
I don't know.

271
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:18,660
I guess it's an entertaining movie, I'll probably watch it too.

272
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,900
Maybe don't kill zombies, talk to them first, I don't know, throw them into a gulag, make

273
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,660
them useful, as if I have all the answers.

274
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,300
That's not my job, I'm just a voice.

275
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,020
Okay, so that was the first English episode of the podcast.

276
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:47,620
Depending on the reaction I get, I'll continue to producing this podcast in German and English.

277
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,500
If there's no interest at all in it, well, that's it, I guess.

278
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,060
So if you are interested in me continuing this podcast in English, then give me some

279
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:09,540
feedback wherever you listen to this, Spotify, YouTube, I don't know, Anchor, Google Podcast.

280
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:16,340
Anyways, have a nice time interval, I guess.

281
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,380
I hope you enjoyed watching this podcast.

282
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,380
If you did, please like and subscribe.

283
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,380
I'll see you next time.

284
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380
Bye.
