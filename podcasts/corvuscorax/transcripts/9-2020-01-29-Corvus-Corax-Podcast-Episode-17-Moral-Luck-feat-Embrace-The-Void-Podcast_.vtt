00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
In dieser Episode des Podcasts spreche ich mit Aaron Rabinovitz mit meinem schlechten

00:04.600 --> 00:09.440
Englisch über das Phänomen des ganz stupide übersetzt moralischen Glücks.

00:09.440 --> 00:14.400
Eine deutsche Zusammenfassung für alle, die entweder kein Englisch können oder sich mein

00:14.400 --> 00:17.960
Englisch nicht antun wollen, würde es am Ende noch zusätzlich geben.

00:17.960 --> 00:22.920
Wenn ihr diesen Podcast unterstützen wollt oder bei dem Gast vorbeischauen wollt, dann

00:22.920 --> 00:24.480
schaut doch mal in die Beschreibung.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.560
Mit diesen Worten viel Spaß.

00:30.000 --> 00:55.640
Welcome back, everyone.

00:55.640 --> 01:01.920
Today in the 17th Episode of the Podcast, we have a very special guest.

01:01.920 --> 01:08.880
He's the person or entity behind one of my favorite podcasts.

01:08.880 --> 01:14.760
And I think he can introduce himself a bit, if that's okay for you.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
Sure.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.040
My name is Aaron Rabinovitz.

01:17.040 --> 01:25.080
I teach at Rutgers University and do Embrace the Void Podcast and the Philosophers in Space

01:25.080 --> 01:31.840
Podcast and generally hang around social medias, trying to get people to argue about

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
philosophy.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
Great.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.920
So today's topic will be moral luck because a lot of the viewers wanted me to talk about

01:38.920 --> 01:44.320
it and that's not really my specialty.

01:44.320 --> 01:49.800
But as far as I'm aware, you have thought quite a bit about the topic.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
Am I correct?

01:50.800 --> 01:51.800
Yeah.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
I'm certainly obsessed with the topic.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.760
I don't know if I have anything particularly insightful or useful to say about it, but

01:56.760 --> 01:59.600
I can certainly explain why I'm obsessed with it.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.600
Great.

02:00.600 --> 02:10.120
I think that would be even better than just saying something very important.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
Fair enough.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.120
Yeah.

02:12.120 --> 02:17.040
No, no, because I think if you're able to motivate some viewers to think about the topic,

02:17.040 --> 02:25.600
I think that will have a more positive outcome than if you just say something that would

02:25.600 --> 02:30.240
finish the whole topic for the viewer.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.320
So just before we really get into the topic, I have to do something that I always do.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.240
I always have a different drink in the show.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.760
It's a really boring drink as always.

02:41.760 --> 02:49.280
Today I have the star drink, orange zero sugar, just so that everyone knows and can

02:49.280 --> 02:54.320
be aware of me annoying them with the sounds of me drinking.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.360
Do you have anything to drink on your end?

02:57.360 --> 03:03.040
So over here it's 11 a.m., so I'm sticking with water at the moment, depending on what

03:03.040 --> 03:07.640
particular podcast I'm recording and what the content is that that can scale up in various

03:07.640 --> 03:09.760
ways towards whiskey.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.240
Okay, great.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.480
So I guess we could just start.

03:15.480 --> 03:24.240
So the first question would be what moral luck is or what moral luck means.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.760
What are we talking about?

03:25.760 --> 03:33.400
Yeah, so moral luck refers to situations where a person is held morally responsible for

03:33.400 --> 03:36.640
something that is beyond their control.

03:36.640 --> 03:45.000
So in contexts where, you know, someone is seen as guilty of a crime and punished for

03:45.000 --> 03:51.600
doing that crime, even though it seems like the fact that they did that crime was beyond

03:51.600 --> 03:58.080
their control in some important way, would be the sort of classic examples of moral

03:58.080 --> 04:00.280
luck.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.760
And the view that I hold is that pretty much all moral judgments are cases of moral luck

04:05.800 --> 04:09.000
because everything is entirely the result of luck.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.160
Everything is just luck all the way down.

04:11.880 --> 04:18.480
And so that raises real problems for someone like me, who also believes that moral judgments

04:18.480 --> 04:24.240
are real and true and apply objectively and that we should care about them.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.080
So how one reconciles those two things, that's that's really tricky dance.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.040
But I think it's good.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.640
Yeah, on that note, I just have a question on your definition of luck.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.920
So what would you define as luck?

04:41.560 --> 04:46.080
Yeah, and so this gets a little tricky to avoid kind of circularities here.

04:46.080 --> 04:52.360
But I think luck refers to things that are beyond our control.

04:53.320 --> 04:58.840
So the sort of textbook examples that we can think of are, you know, if you're playing a

04:58.840 --> 05:03.280
video game or something that has a random number generator in it, right, it rolls a

05:03.280 --> 05:05.440
number that you have no control over.

05:05.640 --> 05:11.320
And that element of luck, you know, shapes the way that the game is played or how how

05:11.320 --> 05:12.880
these kind of games work.

05:12.880 --> 05:19.480
Right. So, you know, other examples of, you know, really cases of really good or really

05:19.480 --> 05:20.640
bad luck. Right.

05:20.640 --> 05:26.000
You happen to be born into a family where you inherit massive amounts of wealth versus

05:26.000 --> 05:28.880
being born into an abusive household, for example.

05:29.840 --> 05:35.160
Right. These are things that I think there's lots of things that we can reasonably say

05:35.160 --> 05:37.440
are beyond people's control.

05:37.840 --> 05:43.120
Those are the things that I think of as, you know, the features of the world that are luck

05:43.600 --> 05:49.240
in relation to me and in relation to other entities.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.920
And then the hard jump is and everything counts as luck.

05:54.920 --> 06:00.160
Right. And like all of the things are things that are beyond your control in an important

06:00.160 --> 06:08.160
sense. OK, so that that actually was one thing that that was quite problematic for me

06:08.160 --> 06:15.760
when I first read about it, because to me it seems like a problem that I also have with

06:15.760 --> 06:21.440
determinism or fatalism, because in a certain way, if you can apply this concept to

06:21.440 --> 06:25.880
absolutely everything, it seems to me very trivial, like the meaning.

06:28.240 --> 06:32.600
It in a certain sense destroys its own meaning.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.640
Its own impact, because.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.560
Right. It cannot not apply.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.960
Well, so there's a tension right between universality and triviality.

06:44.960 --> 06:51.400
Right. Like we have a similar sort of thing in ethics, I think, where, you know,

06:51.600 --> 06:56.600
you want your moral judgments to be your moral premises to be universal.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.600
You want them to apply to everyone in all situations, in all contexts.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.480
And if they don't, that can seem problematic.

07:04.360 --> 07:09.640
But then some folks will argue the flip side of that is you end up with moral principles

07:09.640 --> 07:12.720
that are incredibly trivial in some kind of way.

07:12.720 --> 07:19.080
And then the hard work becomes teasing out if there really is anything that this adds

07:19.080 --> 07:20.160
to the conversation.

07:20.160 --> 07:25.720
Now, here's why I don't think that this is trivial is because I think a lot actually

07:25.720 --> 07:30.720
really does hang on whether or not everything is beyond our control or not.

07:30.720 --> 07:35.280
If it's true that certain things are under our control and certain things aren't, that's

07:35.280 --> 07:40.440
going to have really important implications for how we shape society, how we treat good

07:40.440 --> 07:41.960
people and bad people.

07:42.920 --> 07:48.120
So I don't think that we can say that this is trivial merely in virtue of the fact that

07:48.400 --> 07:54.080
my position is to argue that everything qualifies as luck, because I think that is a

07:54.080 --> 07:58.600
substantive claim that has substantial implications.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
That makes sense?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.800
Yeah, it absolutely makes sense.

08:01.800 --> 08:12.560
But I'm wondering if it is really that important, if it would actually, let's say, let's

08:12.560 --> 08:13.760
say you're absolutely correct.

08:13.760 --> 08:23.920
But would it really change anything in the way of how we experience the world, how we

08:23.920 --> 08:27.520
experience moral dilemmas and so on?

08:28.440 --> 08:29.520
I absolutely think so.

08:30.240 --> 08:36.080
I think that there really is a genuine tension, because so here's why the moral luck problem

08:36.080 --> 08:40.960
and Nagle, I think, does a great job explaining this arises because of a natural feature of

08:40.960 --> 08:46.360
morality, which is that we do think that people should only be held morally responsible

08:46.360 --> 08:48.160
for things that are under their control.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.520
That's a natural condition for moral judgments.

08:51.760 --> 08:57.000
Right. If someone took over your body and went on a killing spree with your body, we

08:57.000 --> 09:00.560
wouldn't think that you should be held morally responsible for that killing spree.

09:01.400 --> 09:07.200
So. So I do think it's important and where we see the implications in the real world

09:07.200 --> 09:10.320
would be in things like how we structure our judicial system.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.800
This is the go to example.

09:11.800 --> 09:17.640
Is that like if you think that human beings have a choice and what they did was wrong and

09:17.640 --> 09:22.280
they did it knowing that it was wrong and that they deserve to be punished for that, you

09:22.280 --> 09:27.040
can build a kind of deterrent, sorry, not deterrent, a kind of retributive model for

09:27.040 --> 09:31.720
justice and say, you know, bad people should go to jail because they deserve to be punished.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.280
If you buy my view, right, it becomes much harder to make any sense of the idea that

09:37.280 --> 09:42.680
people deserve to suffer in any kind of way and that if you're going to have a prison

09:42.680 --> 09:48.000
system, which I still think you need in some form, you're going to have to base it on

09:48.280 --> 09:54.760
rehabilitative kinds of principles, restorative kinds of principles, deterrent kinds of

09:54.760 --> 09:58.120
principles rather than a retributive kind of system.

09:58.400 --> 10:04.720
And that'll have implications for how you build that model, how cruel it is, you know,

10:04.760 --> 10:10.640
what what things you allow your prisoners to do during the times that they are in prison,

10:10.640 --> 10:16.560
stuff like that. So I think it definitely has real applied ethics downstream implications.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.680
And on the personal level, a lot hinges.

10:20.680 --> 10:26.200
A lot of us build our sense of I think all of us, whether we try to resist it some, but

10:26.200 --> 10:31.120
like it's a natural feeling to build your sense of self on your accomplishments and

10:31.120 --> 10:34.520
failures, that like these are the things that define you.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.280
And so I think one reason that people are very uncomfortable with this idea that everything

10:39.280 --> 10:43.760
is luck is that they feel like their sense of self slips away.

10:43.760 --> 10:49.280
And it does. And like part of the reality of recognizing moral luck is recognizing that

10:49.280 --> 10:55.600
there is no free will in a robust sense and with it no robust sense of the separate

10:55.600 --> 10:59.800
self that deserves, you know, a bunch of accolades for doing the right thing.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.480
So I think, yeah, it has lots and lots of implications.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.320
So it's great that you mentioned free will, because I was actually wondering if there

11:07.320 --> 11:14.560
really was a difference on the on a systematic argumentative level between the debate

11:14.560 --> 11:17.720
on free will and determinism and moral luck.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.000
Do you think there is any significance?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.480
I mean, I think they're all connected here, right?

11:23.520 --> 11:31.400
I think what we're saying here is determinism is true and it's true for sentient beings

11:31.400 --> 11:33.920
just as much as it's true for non sentient beings.

11:34.320 --> 11:41.080
And as a result, moral luck is pervasive because luck is pervasive and we continue to

11:41.080 --> 11:42.880
make moral judgments.

11:43.120 --> 11:50.920
So this is a fundamental problem and it is a problem because human beings don't have

11:51.160 --> 11:55.960
free will in the robust kind of sense that we want to think that they do, that you're

11:55.960 --> 12:01.760
not you're just not the author of your actions in the way that would be necessary for it

12:01.760 --> 12:09.080
to be true that you did something wrong in a way that was that was radically independent

12:09.080 --> 12:11.960
and so should be punished in a retributive kind of way.

12:13.800 --> 12:20.040
OK, because to me it was kind of confusing, because when you take a look at the

12:20.040 --> 12:24.680
arguments, how determinism works and how moral luck works, they seem to me to work

12:24.680 --> 12:27.520
on two different different levels.

12:27.520 --> 12:34.080
Determinism is trying to argue from the position of the thing in itself.

12:34.080 --> 12:40.480
If you would like to make this distinction and moral luck is more arguing from the first

12:40.480 --> 12:45.960
person perspective, it seems to me, because luck seems to be a rather strange category

12:45.960 --> 12:47.240
when it comes to determinism.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.800
Mhm, well, so I think it's interesting that you bring that up, because the moral luck

12:52.800 --> 13:00.360
paper that you read is in Nagel's book, Mortal Questions, and he sort of views the unifying

13:00.360 --> 13:06.360
problem of that book, of which moral luck is one version of the problem, as an unresolvable

13:06.360 --> 13:10.960
tension between the subjective way of seeing the world, the way of seeing the world from

13:10.960 --> 13:15.560
our inside first person perspective and an objective account of the world.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.240
The world is seen from the view from nowhere.

13:18.240 --> 13:24.760
And basically the problem is, maybe debatably, from our subjective point of view, we can't

13:24.760 --> 13:26.120
help but see ourselves as free.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.840
Actually, I don't fully believe that, but I think Nagel probably did, or he says that

13:30.840 --> 13:34.880
he does at the end of moral luck.

13:34.880 --> 13:43.560
And so some folks are really concerned that there's no livable way to fully deny the

13:43.560 --> 13:49.840
idea of free will, to deny the idea of the independent, subjectively experiencing self,

13:49.840 --> 13:52.680
to reduce it down to the purely objective.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.360
And I think there are ways in which they're correct about that with regard to phenomenal

13:57.360 --> 14:00.760
consciousness, but not with regard to free will.

14:00.760 --> 14:07.880
I think that the reality is, we are just parts of the large, radically interconnected

14:07.880 --> 14:10.600
system of causal events.

14:10.600 --> 14:18.200
Now, I want to also address your point in terms of unpacking a little bit more the features

14:18.200 --> 14:23.200
of moral luck that Nagel puts forward, because you're right that some of them aren't put

14:23.200 --> 14:27.080
in this necessarily strictly determinist way, though I think that they are just sort of

14:27.080 --> 14:30.880
unpacking forms of determinism.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.040
So he lays out four different kinds of luck.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.920
He talks about luck of consequences, luck of how your actions turn out, right?

14:38.920 --> 14:46.600
He talks about luck of circumstances, what situations that you are facing in your life.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.560
He talks about luck of constitution, which I think is the most important one that he

14:50.560 --> 14:51.560
talks about.

14:51.560 --> 14:56.840
And that's the one that really undermines free will in a robust sense.

14:56.840 --> 15:01.400
And then that's the luck of what makes you who you are, what the features that you happen

15:01.400 --> 15:02.760
to have.

15:02.760 --> 15:08.560
And then there's a fourth one, which often gets dropped out because it's probably exhaustively

15:08.560 --> 15:13.920
accounted for by the other ones, which is essentially the luck of antecedent circumstances,

15:13.920 --> 15:19.560
which is to say, you know, every events are the result of prior events.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.680
And so that one is basically just determinism, right?

15:22.680 --> 15:27.160
It's just saying, you know, we are part of the deterministic framework.

15:27.160 --> 15:34.000
But the value of his argument is the unpacking of that in terms of the nature of constitutive

15:34.080 --> 15:41.240
luck and how it erases any room for an independent, freely acting self.

15:43.240 --> 15:47.600
OK, so you already answered the question of different types.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
No problem.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.520
I think it's good that there's a dynamic in this discussion.

15:57.680 --> 16:03.680
Do you yourself think that there are any epistemic problems, any serious epistemic

16:03.680 --> 16:07.120
problems with this position?

16:08.080 --> 16:12.880
Well, yes and no, I guess is my answer to that question, right?

16:12.880 --> 16:19.200
I think there are massive epistemic problems whenever you're talking about conscious

16:19.200 --> 16:24.040
sentient beings and what they are experiencing or not experiencing.

16:24.320 --> 16:30.440
I don't. So like, I've been wrestling myself with this question of do I have, you know,

16:30.440 --> 16:34.480
like I can tell you, I believe that I am not a free agent, right?

16:34.480 --> 16:38.200
I do not have free will, but I'm mouthing those words to you.

16:38.200 --> 16:44.120
Do I know that I actually believe that or is there some part of me that still clings

16:44.120 --> 16:46.440
to the idea that I am actually free?

16:46.440 --> 16:50.840
There are some people who will argue that, like, I am committed in every action to

16:50.840 --> 16:53.600
still believing that I am free in some kind of way.

16:53.800 --> 16:58.440
I don't necessarily think that's true from a logical argumentative side.

16:58.640 --> 17:03.120
But there's also the psychological question of, you know, am I still clinging to this

17:03.120 --> 17:08.400
habituated idea that I am a free, separate entity when I go around continuing to

17:08.400 --> 17:15.040
enact behaviors that, you know, are things like praising and blaming other people?

17:15.040 --> 17:18.840
Because I will still go around and say, you know, great job for doing that other thing,

17:19.080 --> 17:23.600
right? I think that I can make a sense, reasonably explain why I'm doing that

17:23.600 --> 17:26.320
without appealing to personal freedom.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.680
But it is a habit that is associated with that.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.040
And so, you know, we are creatures of habit.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.000
That's part of the whole argument here.

17:34.240 --> 17:40.120
So, like, it may just be part of my luck that I will continue to always believe that

17:40.120 --> 17:45.160
I'm free, even when I have solid arguments, I think that I am not.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.560
If that were true, that would be really unfortunate, right?

17:47.560 --> 17:51.280
Because that's like saying you're stuck believing false things that you know are

17:51.280 --> 17:53.440
false, which we hope is not the case.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.560
But that could be the bad luck that a person has.

17:57.400 --> 18:03.520
And I'm not even sure how I prove either to myself or to other people that I genuinely

18:03.800 --> 18:05.360
have adopted this belief.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.400
So, like, that's about as big an epistemic problem as that you can get, right?

18:09.400 --> 18:13.320
You don't even know if you're holding a belief or whether you can prove it to yourself

18:13.760 --> 18:18.200
or anyone. I think that, like, I have reasonably good reasons to think that I have

18:18.200 --> 18:21.880
adopted the no control, no free will view.

18:22.240 --> 18:26.760
I'm not convinced that I have any good way to convey that to anyone else in a convincing

18:26.880 --> 18:33.000
fashion if they don't sort of also buy my no free will view and then sort

18:33.000 --> 18:36.600
of infer that I'm really genuinely believing it.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.360
So that's that's one major problem, right?

18:40.360 --> 18:45.080
I guess, you know, other problems are, of course, I can't prove that none of you are

18:45.080 --> 18:47.240
free and it's not just me that's the freak here.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.960
Right. That's that's another major problem here.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.000
But like, I think the argument is sound.

18:52.040 --> 18:57.000
Like, I think there's there's no way to point to anything that anyone does that

18:57.000 --> 19:00.920
isn't incredibly coded in luck and just luck all the way through.

19:04.480 --> 19:11.080
Would you then agree that you have to presuppose certain positions concerning,

19:11.320 --> 19:16.840
for example, the construction of reality?

19:16.920 --> 19:24.600
How how reality at its base is built some ontological presuppositions for that?

19:25.600 --> 19:32.200
I mean, so I guess it's possible just on the topic of sorry, sorry.

19:34.400 --> 19:39.360
Just on the topic, for example, of of the philosophy of science, for example,

19:39.680 --> 19:45.320
because for me it's just like most deterministic accounts nowadays.

19:45.320 --> 19:51.680
It really sounds like an argument from the point of view of science or something

19:51.800 --> 19:55.280
that is approaching science methodologically.

19:57.240 --> 20:02.040
Well, I think it is. Yeah, I mean, I think it is an argument bolstered by

20:02.120 --> 20:06.520
empirical evidence, but I also think that it's it's an argument that can be done

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
without appeals to science would be my I mean, like, I think you could give a

20:13.000 --> 20:18.240
philosophical argument that isn't empirical in nature or fundamentally

20:18.240 --> 20:21.120
empirical in nature. Maybe it's a synthetic a priori kind of thing.

20:21.120 --> 20:28.000
But like, I think it's I think it is the case that we have an argument for this

20:28.240 --> 20:34.520
that isn't just assuming certain things about the nature of reality any more

20:34.520 --> 20:36.680
than like any other argument is right.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.360
Like, I think you can have radical skeptical concerns about all our beliefs.

20:40.360 --> 20:45.600
Like, if if the universe turns out to just not be a consistently behaving thing,

20:45.880 --> 20:47.640
then like everything is out the window.

20:47.880 --> 20:52.440
But like, I think we have good reason to think that the universe behaves

20:52.440 --> 20:57.960
according to consistent patterns and that determinism is the view that like

20:58.360 --> 21:05.960
those consistent patterns involve some sorts of stable relations between things

21:06.960 --> 21:12.600
and that once you have that, the problems arise pretty much immediately.

21:13.360 --> 21:19.040
So I don't I don't think that it's presupposing anything that is implausible.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.760
I think it's presupposing things that are essential for the universe as we

21:22.760 --> 21:26.880
experience it being the way that we experience it in a Kantian kind of sense.

21:27.840 --> 21:35.520
OK. So to take a step back for everyone who's who's listening and who's trying

21:35.520 --> 21:41.440
to get into the topic, where should one start to read, for example?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.920
Yeah, so I would start with the Nagel paper.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.640
I think Thomas Nagel's Moral Luck paper is and you can get it.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.360
It's easy to find Google online.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.880
It's short. It's a little it's a little hard language.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.000
It's not the easiest philosophy language ever, but it's also not the hardest

21:59.000 --> 22:00.840
philosophy language either.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.120
And I think that some of his prose are quite eloquent in laying out the problem,

22:07.120 --> 22:11.640
especially like the parts about two thirds of the way through, where he talks

22:11.640 --> 22:18.560
about how when you really take into account constitutive luck and how everything

22:18.560 --> 22:23.960
about you is the result of factors beyond your control and therefore every action

22:23.960 --> 22:27.800
that you engage in is the result of factors beyond your control.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.800
He talks about how this shrinks the space of the self to an extensionless point.

22:34.360 --> 22:40.320
And I think that that's a really beautiful way of describing how the problem works.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.480
So I think the Nagel paper is really good.

22:44.280 --> 22:49.600
And then, you know, there's various kinds of analysis of this, but I don't I don't

22:49.600 --> 22:56.480
think that anyone has really resolved the problem that he lays out in that

22:56.480 --> 22:57.760
particular paper.

22:57.760 --> 23:02.520
So I think you mentioned, right, you went and read the paper before that, which is

23:02.520 --> 23:07.600
the Williams paper, which I think is good, but I don't think goes as far as the

23:07.600 --> 23:11.000
Nagel paper. And then sorry.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.200
Absolutely. I totally agree.

23:13.720 --> 23:20.120
Yeah. And then there's like one or two individuals whose I'm blanking on the

23:20.120 --> 23:23.240
names, but I can get you for the show notes if you want, who've written like

23:23.480 --> 23:27.640
books about luck who take, I think, different views than me generally in terms

23:27.640 --> 23:33.640
of trying to find, trying to find a way to claim that everything isn't the result

23:33.640 --> 23:36.040
of luck rather than biting the bullet the way that I do.

23:37.520 --> 23:41.680
I don't know of anyone who's out there who's really willing to go.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.600
I don't know. I don't know of a lot of people out there who are going as all in

23:44.600 --> 23:47.160
as I am on on this particular side of things.

23:47.160 --> 23:51.920
I'm sure there are people out there who do take a similar view, though.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.720
Okay, great. Yeah, would would be absolutely great if you can could send me

23:57.720 --> 23:59.800
those names.

24:01.120 --> 24:06.360
Okay, so I just have something left.

24:06.440 --> 24:14.320
I found a definition of luck on the topic that I thought was fairly interesting,

24:14.320 --> 24:16.000
and I wanted to hear your opinion on it.

24:16.040 --> 24:20.800
Maybe you have already heard of it, maybe not from, I hope I pronounce this name

24:20.800 --> 24:22.360
correctly, Nicholas Reschers.

24:23.040 --> 24:23.440
Mhm.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.120
And I summarize it like this.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Something is luck when it is the result of an unplanned event or that the result

24:33.000 --> 24:38.600
itself is unexpected, plus the result has a significant evaluative status in

24:38.600 --> 24:40.480
representing a good or bad result.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.920
So in terms of a benefit or a loss.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.760
Yes, there's a couple of features in there.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.120
So let's go back to it one more time, just real slow.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.320
And I just want to take a part.

24:53.320 --> 24:59.000
Something is luck when it is the result of an unplanned event or that the result

24:59.000 --> 25:03.240
itself is unexpected, plus the results.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.920
Let's hold there for one second, right?

25:04.920 --> 25:08.760
So so I don't know if he's going to say that we need all of these features, but

25:08.760 --> 25:13.360
I'm not sure why either I'm not convinced that either of those features is

25:13.360 --> 25:16.200
necessarily essential for luck.

25:16.440 --> 25:22.720
So like, I think that an event that is planned can still be the result of luck

25:22.720 --> 25:29.640
if the planning process is itself tainted by luck in a, in a sufficient kind of way,

25:29.640 --> 25:32.480
or if the mechanism that is then enacted, right?

25:32.480 --> 25:37.960
So if I plan to roll a die, right, the die result is still the result of luck, it

25:37.960 --> 25:38.880
seems like to me.

25:39.040 --> 25:42.000
Yeah, and your decision to roll the die also and so on and so on.

25:42.160 --> 25:42.640
Right.

25:42.640 --> 25:47.160
And predictability seems to also, I think, be a bit of a red herring here in the

25:47.160 --> 25:52.920
sense that, you know, I think there can be incredibly predictable events that are

25:52.920 --> 25:58.080
still the result of factors beyond anyone's control and so fall into the kind

25:58.080 --> 26:01.600
of luck that I have in mind here, right?

26:01.600 --> 26:06.720
I think your yours and my behavior can be predictable and still the result of luck.

26:06.720 --> 26:12.840
So I'm not convinced that that one makes sense either as a necessary condition.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.920
So all right, go ahead, go ahead.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.200
Why don't you do the other half of it?

26:15.200 --> 26:20.320
So yeah, plus the result has a significant evaluative status in

26:20.320 --> 26:22.200
representing a good or bad result.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.480
The result has a significant evaluative status.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.240
I'm not sure exactly what he means there.

26:29.240 --> 26:33.480
I guess I would need like an example to think about what, what he's trying to

26:33.480 --> 26:34.680
get at with that particular.

26:34.680 --> 26:40.960
If something happened, some event took place and either it can be understood as a

26:40.960 --> 26:44.400
benefit or a loss, I think that that would summarize it.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.520
OK, I mean, yeah, I think, oh, I see.

26:47.520 --> 26:52.040
So he's so the criteria that he's putting in there is for it to count as luck.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.600
It has to be like a good thing or a bad thing essentially.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.880
Yeah, and you have to be able to evaluate it.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.160
I think that that is also very important.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.320
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure that's necessarily true either, right?

27:02.320 --> 27:06.320
So either it's the case that everything is a good thing or a bad thing, in which case

27:06.320 --> 27:08.600
what he's saying is tautologically true, right?

27:08.600 --> 27:13.920
It isn't adding anything to the definition or if there are neutral events out there in

27:13.920 --> 27:17.920
the world, events that are neither good nor bad, I don't see why they would be any

27:17.920 --> 27:25.040
less the result of determinism and therefore any less the result of luck than like it

27:25.040 --> 27:28.840
seems like the sort of account of luck he's giving there is very similar to like an

27:28.840 --> 27:35.000
anthropomorphic kind of like luck as it pertains to my specific desired outcomes

27:35.000 --> 27:40.080
and goals, whereas I think my definition of luck is a much thinner, you know, anything

27:40.080 --> 27:44.760
that is beyond one's control, where that's important because what is beyond one's

27:44.760 --> 27:49.200
control then does have significant implications when we consider morality.

27:51.640 --> 27:57.720
Yeah, OK, I think that those were very good points on this attempt of a definition.

27:59.080 --> 28:04.280
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a hard thing to define and like there's tricky sort of weird

28:04.280 --> 28:09.440
circularity things about that that I have to try to tease out in terms of what I say

28:09.440 --> 28:12.880
when I say, you know, everything is the result of luck because everything is the result

28:12.880 --> 28:20.160
of things beyond our control, where luck means, you know, sort of things beyond our control.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.280
But I do think that it's that's the right way to unpack luck.

28:24.280 --> 28:27.800
And I think Nagel makes a really good case for that as being sort of the right way to

28:27.800 --> 28:33.240
understand this. When we are when we are keeping in the front of our mind, what is

28:33.240 --> 28:38.760
at stake here in terms of judgments of morality and judgments about the nature of the self?

28:42.800 --> 28:49.040
OK. I think we are almost done.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.640
That went faster than I expected.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.960
Oh, that's no problem. If I may, if we have a little bit extra time.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.720
Sure, we have a lot of extra time.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.800
Yeah. Well, there's a there's a way that I try to make this argument to try to make it

29:01.800 --> 29:08.080
compelling for folks who have, you know, who might be sort of skeptical about this,

29:08.080 --> 29:12.520
because usually the response I get is something along the lines of everybody agrees that a

29:12.520 --> 29:17.800
lot of things are the result of luck, but there's still a little part of you inside of you

29:17.800 --> 29:20.680
somewhere that is still making decisions.

29:20.680 --> 29:27.680
And that thing is somehow separate from in the right kinds of ways these endless chains

29:27.680 --> 29:32.120
of luck. And that's where free will still exists.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.960
That's where control still exists.

29:33.960 --> 29:38.720
Right. There's this little person inside at the control panel kind of view.

29:38.920 --> 29:45.520
So I want to try to make a case against that for folks who may be sort of sitting in that

29:45.520 --> 29:47.000
particular place at the moment.

29:47.040 --> 29:52.080
And the way I like to do this is via sort of a Socratic dialogue where I like to ask a

29:52.080 --> 29:54.680
person I'm talking to, to give an example.

29:54.680 --> 29:59.320
I don't know how convinced you are by my arguments at this point, but if you can remember

29:59.320 --> 30:03.840
a time when you weren't convinced by them, if you are, what you would point to as something

30:03.840 --> 30:09.800
in your life that is an action that you would say is beyond it was under your control,

30:09.840 --> 30:12.600
right, that you would say you were you freely chose to do.

30:12.600 --> 30:26.160
OK, so first I want to say that when I presuppose a certain conception of a self, then I absolutely

30:26.160 --> 30:30.160
agree with you.

30:30.160 --> 30:39.320
The way that I understand the self does not have this homunculi that is able to control

30:39.320 --> 30:49.520
anything, but it leaves the possibility for an event that, how do you say, it overcomes the

30:51.080 --> 30:56.640
strict determinism of the real.

30:58.040 --> 31:08.240
But I would have to have to prepare the explanation for that, because it's not that easy.

31:09.840 --> 31:15.040
For me to do this in English just spontaneously.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.360
Sure, I understand.

31:17.360 --> 31:23.240
But if you take this position, then I would absolutely agree with you.

31:23.240 --> 31:29.040
So, but for the sake of my argument, for people who don't agree, is there an action that you

31:29.040 --> 31:35.840
would point to as being the sort of thing that you think should be counted as an argument

31:35.840 --> 31:39.120
against my position or evidence against my position?

31:39.920 --> 31:51.400
OK, I can try to come up with one, but I think that the hypothetical person in this dialogue

31:51.400 --> 31:57.480
could take any action as an example.

31:57.480 --> 32:04.880
So let's say I bought three apples instead of two because I wanted to.

32:05.560 --> 32:12.120
Mhm, yeah, so you're right that I think almost any action can be put forward.

32:12.120 --> 32:15.920
And they usually, I think, actually get chunked into two categories.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.560
The one you gave would be kind of the trivial category, right?

32:18.560 --> 32:24.400
People think that like trivial small actions are independent in some kind of way.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.720
And then the other would be like big momentous actions that they think that they spend a lot

32:28.720 --> 32:34.000
of time deliberating on, for example, would be the other kind where they think that they

32:34.080 --> 32:36.080
have some sort of control over them.

32:37.160 --> 32:43.080
And so the way I push back on these kind of examples is I ask them to apply a kind of

32:43.080 --> 32:48.760
regress to this, a regress of reasons where I ask them to think, you know, why did you

32:48.760 --> 32:51.080
pick the three apples instead of the two apples?

32:52.360 --> 32:57.280
For example, I saw a tweet by Matonia, which motivated me to buy more apples.

32:58.600 --> 33:03.760
Right. So one account could be, you know, I can point to the thing that got me

33:03.760 --> 33:06.320
thinking about having one more apple or something like that, right?

33:06.320 --> 33:10.920
In which case the argument runs, you know, it was luck that you happened to see that

33:10.920 --> 33:12.600
tweet versus not see that tweet, right?

33:12.600 --> 33:14.760
It wasn't under your control in some kind of way.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.800
And so that the the motivating causal force in your behavior was this thing that was

33:20.800 --> 33:22.520
clearly beyond your control.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.640
So that that seems to reduce that down to an example of not freedom in the sense that

33:28.640 --> 33:33.200
I'm talking about in my framework or right.

33:33.200 --> 33:37.360
The other way this sometimes gets answered is, well, nothing caused it, right?

33:37.360 --> 33:40.880
There was absolutely nothing where somebody will try to say there was there was no no

33:40.880 --> 33:44.280
thing that that made me pick three instead of two.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.920
It just happened. Right.

33:47.480 --> 33:52.480
And there it seems like maybe we can call that free.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.240
But I think I think the reality is that's still going to be a determined event.

33:56.400 --> 34:01.160
You may not be able to point to what I wouldn't I wouldn't say that if nothing caused

34:01.160 --> 34:03.120
that it would was really free.

34:03.520 --> 34:07.560
Right. And we certainly wouldn't say it's an example of the kind of will that we have in

34:07.560 --> 34:08.960
mind when we say free will.

34:09.200 --> 34:15.520
Right. We we want our will to be driven by reasons and we don't want to claim that our

34:15.520 --> 34:20.760
will is free merely because it can sometimes act, you know, with no reason whatsoever.

34:22.120 --> 34:25.120
Right. We want to be able to say our will has reasons.

34:25.240 --> 34:32.200
But we chose those reasons and they are us and that we can have, you know, ownership

34:32.200 --> 34:33.400
of those reasons.

34:33.600 --> 34:38.000
So I don't I don't think that kind of, you know, I rose I raised my left hand side of

34:38.000 --> 34:42.640
my right hand is going to be the kind of case that people want to hang their their free

34:42.640 --> 34:43.720
will arguments on.

34:43.880 --> 34:48.560
And I also think that they are pretty clearly still reducible to, you know, causal effects.

34:48.560 --> 34:52.040
Right. If I ask someone, you know, prove to me that you have free will and they raise

34:52.040 --> 34:56.080
their arm and say, you know, I proved it by raising my hand, I would say you you raised

34:56.080 --> 35:00.440
your hand because you wanted some way to prove that I, you know, prove to me that you had

35:00.440 --> 35:04.360
free will. And you in your mind, you were convinced that that would be sufficient evidence.

35:04.560 --> 35:11.120
And so you did that action caused by trying to want to prove to me that you have free

35:11.120 --> 35:12.240
will in that kind of way.

35:13.080 --> 35:17.160
So these regress problems, I think, arise for all of our actions.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.000
Right. The big momentous choices.

35:20.240 --> 35:25.440
You can still ask, you know, what was your reason for doing this big momentous thing?

35:26.440 --> 35:30.720
And they can, you know, if they give the reason, you can then say, well, what about you?

35:30.720 --> 35:38.440
What about your constitutive luck made you such that you made you such that you were

35:38.440 --> 35:42.240
susceptible to that reason and not all the other competing reasons?

35:42.240 --> 35:46.200
Right. Let's say that you you saved someone's life at some point.

35:46.240 --> 35:51.640
Right. Like what what caused you to do that kind of thing would be that you had been

35:51.880 --> 35:55.480
habituated to be the sort of person who would dive into the water and swim and save

35:55.480 --> 35:57.480
someone's life in that particular situation.

35:57.720 --> 36:02.640
You were lucky enough to have the physical capacity to do that physical event in that

36:02.640 --> 36:07.520
moment. All of these things come together to make it the case that you save that

36:07.520 --> 36:09.240
person's life. And it's a good thing.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.120
Right. It's morally good that you saved that person's life.

36:12.360 --> 36:17.640
But ultimately all of the things that contributed to that event were things that

36:17.640 --> 36:18.840
were beyond your control.

36:19.720 --> 36:27.800
Hmm. Yeah, I only have one question for the first answer, because to me it sounds like

36:28.400 --> 36:34.680
the functionalist description of the self, where you have an output and it doesn't

36:34.680 --> 36:36.080
really matter what happened inside.

36:36.080 --> 36:40.600
But you have an you have an input that doesn't really matter what happens inside.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.600
And then you have an output.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.520
So it's this chain of reactions where the internal state.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.160
Yeah, OK, sure.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.040
No, I didn't know if you've heard that from talking about on the show before.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.640
And that was why you were trying to poke at me with this.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.880
And so, yeah, so here's what I'll say about that.

36:58.880 --> 37:05.840
I it is similar to a functionalist account of the self and that they are both objective

37:06.040 --> 37:09.040
accounts of the self rather than subjective.

37:09.040 --> 37:15.040
But on my view, I don't think that this is incompatible with there being a phenomenal

37:15.040 --> 37:20.840
self that exists and is part of these causal frameworks.

37:20.840 --> 37:24.880
So usually when people think of a functionalist account of the self, they think of an

37:24.880 --> 37:30.360
eliminativist account, functionalist account that says there is no, you know, robust

37:30.360 --> 37:32.240
mental properties or something like that.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.520
There is literally just the input output.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.480
My view is sorry.

37:38.480 --> 37:45.320
I just want to ask if you would then say that in your opinion, the phenomenal

37:45.320 --> 37:49.840
consciousness has some form of causal power or if it just is part of the.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.840
OK, yes, I reject epiphenomenalism.

37:53.840 --> 38:00.520
I think I think that mental states or properties have some sort of causal impact.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.440
And that's absolutely great.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.880
We agree on that. Oh, yeah.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.520
Yeah, no, I totally think that's the case.

38:05.520 --> 38:10.320
My view is just the mental properties and states are just as much the result of luck

38:10.320 --> 38:12.400
as the physical properties and states.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.400
And so they are part of the causal chains.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.040
So your beliefs, for example, right?

38:17.040 --> 38:21.760
I think that your beliefs have and play an important role in how you act in your life.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.680
And they are mental states that you possess.

38:24.680 --> 38:27.960
But every belief you have is the result of luck.

38:27.960 --> 38:32.120
Everything that you've come to believe is the result of the luck of your education,

38:32.120 --> 38:37.920
the location that you were in, your dispositions with regard to like how much evidence

38:37.920 --> 38:42.040
you personally feel you need in order to believe a thing or not believe a thing.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.040
So, yeah, I think.

38:45.040 --> 38:49.040
Yeah, I think the functionalist account is not a sufficient account

38:49.040 --> 38:53.800
if it's meant to replace or leave out the phenomenal side of things.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.520
But the phenomenal side of things are not indeterminate.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.120
They are part of the deterministic framework.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.120
OK.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.880
I adopt lots of very weird positions and then try to match them together, I suppose, to put this.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.040
I don't think that it's really a weird position.

39:14.040 --> 39:17.240
I think, actually, that's what a lot of functionalists are lacking.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.880
I mean, it comes with cost is what I mean.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.280
There's always, you know, like sure, but which position position doesn't.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.000
Right, of course, except for trivialism.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.960
Right. We could always be very trivialist about this.

39:30.200 --> 39:36.560
And like, you know, I mean, I mean, do you know the epistemological position of trivialism?

39:37.080 --> 39:39.400
Oh, no. What is that?

39:40.080 --> 39:41.680
It's absolutely great. I love it.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.400
It's that every proposition is true.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.560
Hmm. Interesting.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.960
So you can't really disagree with it because they will agree with you that it's wrong,

39:51.320 --> 39:53.600
but it's still true because it's not true.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.240
Oh, this is the bit from Fiddler on the Roof where it's like, oh, you're right.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.560
You're right. Oh, and you're right.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.160
You're right, too. Yeah, I know that joke.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.800
Yeah, but it's a real position.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.440
Yeah, I mean, real. I mean, I'm a discordian.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.240
I think everything is true in some sense and false in some sense and meaningless in some sense.

40:12.560 --> 40:17.760
And thanks for reminding me to read the Discordia Procipia.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.360
Oh, yes. Right.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.960
And so here's what I mean.

40:20.960 --> 40:25.040
One of the things I will say about like the kind of quietest,

40:25.520 --> 40:30.640
you know, unresolvability side of all of this that like,

40:31.840 --> 40:37.440
you know, I don't think there's a solution here because I don't think that

40:38.160 --> 40:43.640
our sense of self is really reconcilable with the reality as we understand it.

40:43.640 --> 40:48.000
So I think the best thing to do is to try to jettison our sense of self

40:48.000 --> 40:52.080
and replace it with a more sophisticated framework

40:52.080 --> 40:55.920
that keeps front and center in our mind all of these,

40:57.760 --> 41:01.360
however you think is the result of luck, because I don't think it changes our behavior

41:01.360 --> 41:08.560
in terms of things like humility and how we approach others when they've done things wrong.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.520
But it's always going to be an uneasy tension

41:13.720 --> 41:18.440
because it's always going to be tricky to figure out how to

41:18.880 --> 41:21.720
reinforce people in acting in better ways.

41:21.720 --> 41:22.880
Because I like another part of this.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.600
I do absolutely think that we should still change people's behavior

41:25.600 --> 41:27.520
and think that we can change people's behavior.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.280
And so the question is, how do we do that in a way that

41:32.400 --> 41:36.360
isn't too like horrifyingly dystopian, right?

41:36.360 --> 41:40.680
We still have to kind of respect their autonomy in sophisticated ways, even though.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.480
So, you know, one way to read what I'm saying

41:44.480 --> 41:47.800
would be to say that I've rejected the idea that humans have autonomy.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.360
But I don't think that's the case.

41:49.360 --> 41:54.680
I think that you have autonomy in a sense, in the sense of being able to hear

41:54.680 --> 41:58.720
arguments and adopt different beliefs as a result of those arguments.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.880
Now, whether or not you adopt them is the result of luck.

42:02.160 --> 42:06.280
But we should still respect individuals' freedom.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.400
You know, we shouldn't try to brainwash you.

42:08.400 --> 42:12.080
We should try to convince you, is basically what I'm saying, that there are more

42:12.080 --> 42:16.600
or less coercive ways of approaching changing people's behavior.

42:16.840 --> 42:22.640
And the reality of moral luck is not does not give us sort of carte blanche to go around

42:23.520 --> 42:27.840
reprogramming people because we're all programmed to begin with, if that makes sense.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.680
Yeah, absolutely, it does.

42:32.200 --> 42:35.200
I think if it's true, it would be

42:36.200 --> 42:38.480
really good for everyone to adopt you.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.720
I think it's really healthy.

42:41.720 --> 42:46.480
I like this is why this is why I'm not sure if I actually believe it or not.

42:46.480 --> 42:50.360
But I really do think that the more I've internalized this view, the more I'm able

42:50.360 --> 42:54.480
to cope with bad things, the more like,

42:56.600 --> 43:01.040
you know, when certain people do certain things.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.080
Yeah, the more I can forgive.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.520
And it's hard. Again, there's that there's that unrelenting tension of like,

43:06.880 --> 43:10.320
I don't want this to become a view that means that no one has ever held

43:10.320 --> 43:12.520
responsible for anything in any way.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.840
I just think that we have to hold them responsible in the right way.

43:15.840 --> 43:19.280
And with awareness of the factors

43:19.280 --> 43:23.320
that made them engage in that particular kind of behavior.

43:25.160 --> 43:29.480
And also on the on the personal side, that someone should be happy

43:29.480 --> 43:32.720
if they do something that is something that they wanted to achieve.

43:33.520 --> 43:36.680
Yeah, I mean, they take pleasure, right?

43:36.680 --> 43:38.680
Like crazy. You can't resist taking pleasure.

43:38.680 --> 43:41.560
So like take some pleasure in the world.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.680
And like, I don't think that luck undermines that at all, right?

43:44.680 --> 43:48.480
Everything that I find pleasurable, I do as a result of luck, find it pleasurable.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.960
But I still find it pleasurable.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.120
Like, I still love having this conversation with you.

43:52.360 --> 43:55.640
And like, you know, if we're stuck here, you might as well do the things

43:55.640 --> 43:57.640
that are pleasurable up to a point, right?

43:57.640 --> 43:59.840
There's moral obligations that get in the way

43:59.840 --> 44:01.760
and you shouldn't always just do what's pleasurable.

44:01.760 --> 44:05.360
So I think like none of this undermines the complexity

44:05.360 --> 44:10.480
of moral judgments and like all of the competing factors

44:10.480 --> 44:13.680
that go into making good moral decisions.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.160
In fact, I think it just makes it harder.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.040
It makes it more like you have to recognize that like you're going to spend

44:19.040 --> 44:22.400
your whole life wrestling with moral tensions

44:22.680 --> 44:25.920
and it's going to be a matter of luck how well you actually do.

44:26.280 --> 44:29.240
And that that means that I think that you can like let yourself

44:29.240 --> 44:31.400
off the hook a little bit more than some people do.

44:31.560 --> 44:34.560
I think it's you know, I think a lot of ethics come down to correctives

44:34.560 --> 44:38.120
that like if you if you are, you know, if you have the luck

44:38.120 --> 44:41.920
of being the sort of person who lets yourself off the hook too much, do that less.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.440
Right. And if you're the sort of person who, you know,

44:45.920 --> 44:48.600
you know, beats yourself up for weeks on end, this is what this is.

44:48.600 --> 44:51.160
Like why I became an ethicist is because I'm the sort of person who like

44:51.640 --> 44:54.840
just, you know, kills myself over and over when I've done something

44:54.840 --> 44:58.680
even minorly wrong to someone. I just like it makes me crazy.

44:59.680 --> 45:03.320
And so like maybe I've adopted this as a corrective

45:03.320 --> 45:06.480
for letting myself off the hook a little bit more.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.480
They, you know, we always joke that like philosophers

45:10.480 --> 45:12.360
are always always telling you more about themselves

45:12.360 --> 45:14.200
than about the nature of the universe.

45:14.200 --> 45:18.240
So maybe I'm just, you know, confessing to everyone

45:18.240 --> 45:21.720
that I don't have free will and maybe all of you do so.

45:22.280 --> 45:26.720
Yeah, but that wouldn't be really a problem, because in the end, as a solipsist, you.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.200
Right, I'm the only one.

45:29.200 --> 45:33.520
So the rest of you are just figments of my not free imagination.

45:33.520 --> 45:35.920
It would actually be horrible if you would be a solipsist

45:35.920 --> 45:38.600
who thinks that you are the only one who's determined.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.040
I think you just described God.

45:41.040 --> 45:44.320
I think that's pretty much how God works.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.400
OK, great.

45:46.400 --> 45:49.160
I do believe you all are real, though, if it makes you feel any better.

45:50.600 --> 45:55.520
OK, when we when we are already talking about what's real and what not,

45:56.560 --> 46:01.680
I hope you're aware that I have reappropriated your lightning round.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.480
I am, and I approve of this.

46:04.480 --> 46:07.080
All ideas are free for everyone.

46:07.080 --> 46:09.400
And I modified it a bit.

46:09.920 --> 46:13.360
I try I try to have less categories in the end, I had more.

46:15.880 --> 46:16.600
It's hard, right?

46:17.600 --> 46:21.760
Absolutely, especially because I have a big interest in psychoanalysis,

46:21.760 --> 46:24.640
so I can't not ask certain things.

46:24.800 --> 46:28.040
Every subset of the every subset of the psychological mind.

46:28.680 --> 46:31.960
So how that works, at least from the Lacanian perspective.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.520
And I don't know if you've caught this on the show, but I've

46:36.240 --> 46:38.800
I've started adding a question at the beginning that I'm finding to be very useful.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.400
I have, but I will not.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.640
You're not going to ask that. Yeah.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.680
OK, fair enough.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.560
Do you think that it primes them?

46:46.560 --> 46:49.880
I think it's useful, but I don't like doing useful things.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.400
I mean, I think there are tradeoffs in doing it.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.200
I think it changes their answers and maybe you want the answers to be different

46:56.200 --> 46:59.680
or maybe you don't. So I think there's no there's no moral

46:59.680 --> 47:01.640
fact of the matter about how to do the lightning round.

47:01.640 --> 47:03.480
It's just luck.

47:05.200 --> 47:10.040
OK, so I think every viewer is aware of how this works.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.840
Just basically I will ask if something is real or not and.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.760
You will answer whether or not you think it's real or not,

47:19.760 --> 47:22.920
and you will not be able to explain what you mean by that.

47:23.960 --> 47:26.600
And I promise that I've done prep work in this.

47:26.600 --> 47:29.200
I'm shooting from the hip 100 percent.

47:29.200 --> 47:33.040
Would have been hard, because some of them, I guess, you might

47:33.040 --> 47:35.640
not really have thought about before.

47:35.640 --> 47:36.640
Here's hoping.

47:38.160 --> 47:40.480
Is this the first time you have to suffer through this?

47:40.480 --> 47:43.400
It is. This is a novel experience for me.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.360
Absolutely great. I feel really honored.

47:46.360 --> 47:49.600
Yeah, the torture implement is on the other foot.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.160
OK, so let's start.

47:54.160 --> 47:57.520
The first question would be, is the real lightning round

47:57.520 --> 48:00.520
real?

48:00.520 --> 48:02.600
Is the real real?

48:02.600 --> 48:05.320
Yes, real.

48:05.320 --> 48:08.480
So what about the symbolic order?

48:08.480 --> 48:11.160
The sorry, the symbolic symbolic order.

48:14.760 --> 48:17.600
Yeah, I think symbolic orders are real.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.000
And the imaginary.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.440
Yes.

48:23.440 --> 48:26.560
OK, now a classic one, the external world.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.720
Yes, real colors.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.280
Honestly, not real.

48:38.280 --> 48:42.840
OK, phenomenal consciousness, real, the self.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.160
Not real gender.

48:50.920 --> 48:53.400
Not real race.

48:54.400 --> 48:57.120
Not real species.

49:00.200 --> 49:03.920
Said I really I personally struggle with this with this line here, I.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.080
I'm going to go with not real, not real.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.160
OK, morality, real.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.720
More luck, real, pervasive.

49:17.640 --> 49:20.600
Rights, real.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.760
Borders, borders.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.440
Not real.

49:29.440 --> 49:35.160
OK, knowledge, real.

49:36.280 --> 49:39.880
God, gods or similar entities.

49:39.880 --> 49:42.320
Not real society.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.560
Real.

49:49.560 --> 49:53.400
And just to throw your silence.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.240
Real, yeah.

49:57.240 --> 50:00.160
OK, fictional characters.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.840
Pardon me, really doesn't want to say real.

50:11.840 --> 50:15.200
Do I genuinely believe that they are real, though?

50:15.200 --> 50:16.960
Yeah, I do. I think I do.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.920
Yeah, sure, they're real.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.640
Great. Holes.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.480
Holes are real.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.000
Great. Chess.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.000
Chess like the game chess.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.440
Chair. Oh, chairs, excuse me, chairs.

50:34.760 --> 50:37.200
Chairs are sitting.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.440
Yeah, chairs are not real.

50:41.880 --> 50:43.760
OK, desks.

50:45.480 --> 50:48.080
Desks are also not real.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.800
Sandwiches.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.560
Sandwiches are not real, definitely not real.

50:53.560 --> 50:55.640
OK, science.

51:00.240 --> 51:04.400
As far as I can tell, not well, I don't know if I think society is real.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.680
Yeah, I think science is real.

51:07.680 --> 51:09.840
OK, beauty.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.600
I'm just going to be wildly inconsistent and say that it's real,

51:20.600 --> 51:24.160
even though I said colors aren't real earlier, I'm doing it.

51:24.160 --> 51:27.200
OK, that does not have to be necessarily.

51:27.200 --> 51:29.520
I know, I know that it doesn't necessarily be inconsistent,

51:29.520 --> 51:31.120
but my justifications for it are.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.640
Yeah, linear time.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.760
Linear time.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.040
That's a hard one.

51:42.040 --> 51:44.520
Honest, I'll say not real.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.240
OK, the unconscious.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.600
Real.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.200
OK, unicorns.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.200
Unicorns.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.440
Is a subset of fictional characters?

52:02.440 --> 52:04.240
Sure, yeah, real.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.240
Causality.

52:06.240 --> 52:08.240
Causality.

52:08.320 --> 52:10.320
Not real.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.320
Causality.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.320
Causality is real.

52:14.320 --> 52:16.320
Nothingness.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.320
Nothingness is real.

52:18.320 --> 52:20.320
Yeah.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.320
Great.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.320
And the last one would be crows.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.320
Crows.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.320
Not real.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.320
Oh, now I'm sad.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.320
Oh, I still like you in a conventional sense.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.320
I'm just talking like ultimately you're not real.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.320
But it's OK, because ultimately I'm not real either.

52:40.320 --> 52:43.320
So like it's not a slight against you, it's we're on the same boat.

52:43.320 --> 52:46.320
But the problem is I'm now twice not real.

52:46.320 --> 52:50.320
So myself not real and me being a crow.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.320
That's very problematic.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.320
But it makes you feel better, like I was just clearly wildly inconsistent

52:55.320 --> 53:00.320
in my assessment, so like no one should take anything I say remotely seriously.

53:00.320 --> 53:07.320
But would being two times not real not be like being real?

53:07.400 --> 53:08.400
Oh, yeah.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.400
Like two negatives canceling each other out?

53:10.400 --> 53:12.400
Yeah, I'd buy that.

53:12.400 --> 53:14.400
It's like horseshoe theory.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.400
You circle all the way back around to being real.

53:16.400 --> 53:19.400
I'm so not real that I'm real again.

53:19.400 --> 53:22.400
Horseshoe theory of ontology.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.400
Retro-real.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.400
OK, great.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
That's it.

53:26.400 --> 53:28.400
Thank you for taking the time.

53:28.400 --> 53:29.400
No problem.

53:29.400 --> 53:30.400
Thank you for having me on.

53:30.400 --> 53:35.400
I always love chatting about moral luck and how absurd reality is.

53:35.480 --> 53:36.480
OK.

53:42.480 --> 53:45.480
Man spricht generell über moralisches Glück,

53:45.480 --> 53:48.480
wenn jemand, der handelt, als moralischer Akteur bewertet wird,

53:48.480 --> 53:51.480
obwohl ein signifikanter Teil seines Handelns

53:51.480 --> 53:56.480
von Faktoren außerhalb seines Einflusses beeinflusst oder bewirkt wird.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.480
Dieser Umstand wirft die Frage auf,

53:58.480 --> 54:02.480
inwiefern man jemanden für sein Handeln bewerten kann und sollte.

54:02.560 --> 54:06.560
Je nachdem, wie ernst man das Thema moralisches Glück nimmt,

54:06.560 --> 54:09.560
ist niemand mehr als gut oder schlecht zu bewerten,

54:09.560 --> 54:12.560
da die Person nichts für das Handeln kann.

54:12.560 --> 54:15.560
Diese gesamte Argumentationslinie erinnert an Diskussionen

54:15.560 --> 54:18.560
über freien Willen und Determinismus.

54:18.560 --> 54:21.560
Wie in dieser Diskussion ist auch hier die Position

54:21.560 --> 54:26.560
eines harten moralischen Glücks schwer im eigenen Leben umzusetzen.

54:26.560 --> 54:31.560
Thomas Nagel hat in seinem einflussreichen Artikel über moral luck

54:31.640 --> 54:34.640
vier Arten von moralischem Glück herausgearbeitet.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.640
Erstens, resultierendes Glück.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.640
Über resultierendes Glück spricht man,

54:39.640 --> 54:42.640
wenn alles außer dem Resultat der Handlung gleich ist,

54:42.640 --> 54:45.640
also die Intention, die Vorbereitung und so weiter.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.640
Und dieses Resultat Produkt von Glück ist.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.640
Zum Beispiel, wenn zwei Personen betrunken nach Hause fahren

54:52.640 --> 54:55.640
und einer von beiden bringt dadurch einen Menschen um.

54:55.640 --> 54:59.640
Wir sollten verstehen, dass es sich dabei nur um resultierendes Glück handelt

54:59.720 --> 55:02.720
und beide gleich bewerten.

55:02.720 --> 55:05.720
Zweitens, das den Umständen verschuldete Glück.

55:05.720 --> 55:08.720
Hierüber spricht man, wenn die äußeren Umstände

55:08.720 --> 55:11.720
das moralische Handeln signifikant beeinflussen.

55:11.720 --> 55:14.720
Ein Beispiel dafür sind die Menschen,

55:14.720 --> 55:17.720
die in Deutschland mit den herrschenden Nazis kollaborierten,

55:17.720 --> 55:21.720
es aber, während sie vorher ausgewandert, nicht getan hätten.

55:21.720 --> 55:24.720
Wenn diese Unterscheidung im Verhalten auftauchen würde,

55:24.720 --> 55:27.720
haben wir es mit dem, den Umständen verschuldeten Glück zu tun.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.800
Drittens, konstitutives Glück.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.800
Hierbei geht es darum, mit welchen Eigenschaften und Dispositionen

55:33.800 --> 55:36.800
jemand ins Leben kommt und aufwächst.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.800
Diese Art des moralischen Glücks ist insbesondere

55:39.800 --> 55:42.800
im politischen Kontext äußerst relevant,

55:42.800 --> 55:45.800
da man hierüber aus einem anderen Blickwinkel über Themen

55:45.800 --> 55:48.800
wie Umverteilung, Privilegien usw. diskutieren kann.

55:48.800 --> 55:51.800
Viertens, kausales Glück.

55:51.800 --> 55:54.800
Dabei geht es darum, wie jemand durch vorherige Umstände

55:54.880 --> 55:57.880
Determiniert wurde.

55:57.880 --> 56:00.880
Für weitere Informationen, die tiefer gehen bezüglich dieses Themas

56:00.880 --> 56:03.880
und neue Einsichten und Kritik vorstellen,

56:03.880 --> 56:06.880
kann ich das Buch Moral Luck, editiert von Daniel Stedman, vorschlagen.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.880
Es beinhaltet sowohl die klassischen Essays

56:09.880 --> 56:12.880
als auch neuere zu diesem Thema.

56:12.880 --> 56:15.880
Ich hoffe, die Episode hat euch gefallen.

56:15.880 --> 56:18.880
Wenn ja, dann gebt doch eine Rückmeldung.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.880
Ansonsten wünsche ich euch noch einen schönen Tag.

56:21.880 --> 56:24.960
Tschüss.
