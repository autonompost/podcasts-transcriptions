0	7800	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome Matt Huber in today's episode.
7800	13400	Matt is Professor of Geography and the Environment at Syracuse University
13400	20400	and author of Climate Change as Class War Building Socialism on a Warming Planet.
20400	24800	I recorded this episode at the The Great Transition Conference
24800	29800	where I was invited to take part in a symposium on democratic economic planning
29800	35200	and I want to send my warmest thanks to the organizers of the conference in general
35200	39600	but also to the organizers of the symposium specifically.
39600	47800	Thank you Simon Tremblay-Pépin, I'm sorry if I butcher your name, very sorry Simon, I hope it's not that bad.
47800	54600	So thank you to Simon and his team and thank you to the Democratic Planning Research Group
54600	61000	at the Research Center on Social Innovation and Transformation at St. Paul University Ottawa.
61000	67000	You'll find links to their work in the show notes and I want to particularly highlight
67000	72300	the work of their collective planning for entropy, you'll find their paper
72300	80100	Democratic Economic Planning Social Metabolism and the Environment linked in the show notes as well, please go and read it.
80100	83400	It's unfortunately behind a paywall I have to admit
83400	90600	but you know the Spiel and if you write one of the authors, for example Simon,
90600	94200	I'm quite sure that he'll be happy to send the paper to you.
94200	101000	Huge shout outs also to Ref and Gherm who presented in the session before the one that I was on.
101000	108000	It was a pleasure meeting you all and it's really inspiring to see that the debate around democratic planning
108000	112100	has so many great people from different fields working on it.
112100	115400	I'm very much looking forward to everything to come.
115400	124800	I recorded two episodes during the conference and one or two might be in the making with people I met or contacted there as well.
124800	131500	The two that I already recorded during the conference are the one with Matt Huber that you are about to hear
131500	135900	and the second one is a conversation with Elisa Long-Conn-Antileo
135900	140700	who was the first president of the Constitutional Convention in Chile
140700	144400	and I was really happy to be able to talk to her as well.
144400	147700	I recorded both of these episodes at the same day
147700	154400	and it was really interesting for me to have these two very different conversations so close to each other.
154400	157500	The episode with Elisa will be up next.
157500	165300	Before we start today's episode, I want to welcome Johannes, Grishan and Marc as patrons of Future Histories
165300	170100	and I want to thank Fabian and Lucas for their kind donations
170100	178900	and now, please enjoy today's episode with Matt Huber on building socialism, climate change and class war.
184300	185200	Welcome, Matt.
185200	186200	Thank you for having me.
186200	187700	It's a great pleasure.
187700	193800	Matt, let's start with an overview of your general argument in climate change as class war.
193800	197200	What are the main points that you wanted to bring across?
197300	206500	Well, I start the book by saying that the main problem we have is we're losing the struggle to solve climate change.
206500	209200	Emissions keep going up.
209200	213800	They reached a record in the year the book was published in 2022
213800	218700	and as long as emissions are going up, we still are losing the struggle.
218700	225400	So, you know, what I argue is that the struggle is really a power struggle
225400	231300	over a class of people that control our energy system and control it for profit
231300	238100	and that if we want to win the struggle, we're going to have to build a hugely powerful movement to take on those interests.
238100	247500	And so what I argue is that the current climate movement as it's constituted is not particularly powerful.
247500	253400	It's pretty much embedded, I argue, in the kind of what I call the professional class,
253400	262000	kind of minority of highly educated populations that work in academia or NGOs, scientists.
262000	271200	And what we have is, you know, a pretty significant group of people in these kind of micro political spaces
271200	277000	that aren't really able to build a much broader mass politics around climate.
277000	283000	And for that, I argue, so I take a pretty standard sort of Marxist approach.
283000	286700	That class is really about who controls production.
286700	292100	I critique the way in which climate change is often discussed as a problem of individual consumption
292100	296400	and consumptive behavior, individual carbon footprints.
296400	302800	And I argue that really it's about how we produce energy, how we produce commodities,
302800	313200	how we produce food, you know, and the kind of underlying industrial systems that are sort of behind the scenes in production.
313200	322500	And so I argue from a standard Marxist perspective, you know, the working class has particular power objectively
322500	329600	by being the vast majority of society, by actually doing the work in these systems that can actually,
329700	336100	you know, withdraw their labor, go on strike and actually force a crisis on the elites to pay attention.
336100	343200	So that actually, if we could start to construct a more working class climate politics,
343200	347000	we could maybe start to think about building a much more powerful movement.
347000	349300	So I think about that in two ways.
349300	351300	This is just an overview.
351300	356800	But that, you know, we need a certain kind of climate program that will appeal to the whole working class,
356800	367200	which is again, the majority of society, people struggling to make ends meet, struggling to pay for rent and utility bills and all the rest.
367200	376700	And so if we can, you know, pair climate decarbonization with more increased secure access to people's basic material needs,
376700	380000	you could start to build a much broader popular base.
380000	381900	So that's sort of the broad strategy.
382000	390400	People have, you know, called maybe like a Green New Deal could do something like this that kind of tries to offer big universal public goods under the banner of climate action.
390400	400900	But I also argue we need a much more focused strategy in the labor movement and the union movement that is oriented towards transforming these industrial sectors that are at the core of the climate crisis.
400900	407200	And in the book, I take a pretty narrow argument that really the core sector that we should be looking at is electricity.
407600	412500	You know, most experts say if we're going to solve climate change, it goes through the electricity sector.
412500	419300	We're going to have to clean up the electric sector, then electrify a lot of things that don't currently run on electricity.
419300	430500	So I focus on the fact that, you know, the electricity sector happens to be quite, you know, in the United States, at least quite unionized, like a high level of union density, comparatively speaking.
430600	445400	And so therefore, there's there's already an organized base in this sector that could be at least if not, you know, you know, socialists talk about like people get jobs in strategic sectors and try to build a fighting kind of union movement in those sectors.
445900	457000	But even if not, like if you're just an ordinary climate activist, you should really be thinking about how to align with and and get these unions on board for a kind of climate action.
457000	460200	Because I think it's kind of socialism 101.
460200	470300	If you want to transform a certain system of production, the best, most powerful actors to do that are the workers themselves who have the knowledge of that sector.
470300	478100	They have the skills that they understand materially how it works, but also they have the power because they do the work in that sector.
478100	481700	So again, the book kind of narrowly focuses on electricity.
481700	496300	I think since I've written it, I've realized that really when we're talking about decarbonization, we're talking about a massive project of rebuilding our infrastructure and totally, you know, changing the material system under which we live.
496700	503000	And I think that can appeal to a much broader suite of unions and workers in the United States.
503000	510600	We call them the building trades, the people that would build new transit systems, new housing systems, new and new electricity systems.
510600	523500	All of those workers, you know, pipe fitters, welders, construction workers, those are going to be the people who would really benefit from a kind of big, you know, investment program to solve the climate crisis.
523500	526200	Now, the problem is we're not doing that, right?
526200	528700	We're not doing this big investment program.
528700	535300	So a lot of times those those unions don't really see much in it for them when it comes to climate action.
535400	540800	In fact, most climate action gets constructed as about shutting down particular industries.
540800	545000	So in any event, that's a long answer, but that's kind of an overview of the argument.
545000	561900	The book really has three parts, you know, the capitalist class that's responsible for the crisis, the owners of production, the people that profit off it, the professional class, which is where the climate movement is housed in this kind of minority of society, not particularly powerful.
561900	569600	And then a working class kind of strategy for climate that that I suggest might have a chance of winning.
569600	585400	And when it comes to winning over the working class for such a project, the core argument or at least what I saw as one of the main points of the argument that you make is that you will have to have an attractive offer for the working class.
586400	598400	And what I really liked about the way that you framed it is that, and this is something that I would absolutely get behind, is that the essential core of this offer is security.
598400	608000	So it's a form of existential security that takes off the burden of everyday life, the burden of this struggle that is put upon us all.
608000	611600	And I absolutely can get behind this.
611600	630700	My question would be, you tried to differentiate between sectors that need to grow, sectors that need to de-grow, and you kind of argue against, for example, the de-growth movement that, at least in the way that you presented, argues for a total de-growth.
630700	641800	So could you maybe explain this relationship between the offer on the one side and the question of growth or no growth or growth in which sector?
641800	651100	Yeah. Yeah, you know, the more I have these debates and talk to de-growth people, the more I realize and they realize that we all agree, actually.
652000	660900	Well, not on everything, but we all agree that we actually want to grow certain parts of the economy and de-grow others.
660900	666800	And so one of my frustrations is really just the word de-growth.
666800	668600	It's not actually what they're talking about.
668600	680700	You know, like they talk about really investing in what they call universal public services, exactly what you just said, giving people material security, guaranteeing people in our country.
680700	683400	We dream of guaranteed health care.
683400	686400	We dream of, you know, housing as a human right.
686400	696700	You know, on the climate crisis, there have been organizers in energy and environmental justice that have called that we really should have electricity as a human right.
696700	708800	Like these types of there are some basic needs that working class people struggle to acquire that could be guaranteed and offer more security, as you said.
708800	723000	In general, you know, de-growth has really, they take a, I call it in the book, I think a territorial or geographical approach to what needs to grow and what needs to de-grow where they say,
723000	731100	you know, it's really the global north, the rich countries that need to de-grow so that we can allow the poor global south countries to grow.
731200	741900	And to me, that takes a conflict, a geographical conflict between north and south, which is actually, from my point of view, a class conflict that we need to think about.
741900	751400	And, you know, there's extremely poor people in the global north that need to see tremendous growth in their access to food, to, you know, you know,
751400	758400	hookworm has returned to parts of the south in the United States where they just don't even have basic sanitation.
758500	767100	And so these are diseases we thought we eradicated in the early 20th century, and they're returning right now to like places in Mississippi and Alabama.
767100	769800	And likewise, in the global south, there are capitalists.
769800	776300	There are very, very rich people who live in immense luxury, have tremendous power over resources.
776300	785200	So I like to take a class approach that says we need to, you know, yes, there's some sectors we want to grow and de-grow,
785200	790100	but actually what we want to do is de-grow capitalist control over our economy.
790100	800200	We want to de-grow the capitalist class and we want to see a lot of growth and expansion and what the working class can expect and the offers you say.
800200	810100	Because I think what defines capitalism for a lot of working class people is just insecurity, stress, anxiety about about meeting basic needs.
810100	812100	And I've used this quote a lot.
812200	822100	It really, I think, hit the nail on the head when in France you had the yellow vest movement chanting in the streets that politicians care about the end of the world,
822100	832200	but we're trying to get to the end of the month, you know, like the inability of climate politics to really address those end of month struggles.
832200	841100	And again, I think de-growth advocates that do strongly talk about offering universal public services.
841100	845000	That's a good point of agreement, I would say.
845000	858200	I mean, just as a note, I recently saw a tweet by Jason Hickel on Twitter where he very, very explicitly argued for joining like the de-growth movement and the class struggle movement.
858200	870100	And when reading through the threat, I thought like, okay, well, there's not that much disagreement between what you describe in your book and what Jason Hickel was trying to argue for in this threat.
870100	876000	And this might be a development that has taken place over a certain period of time in the last years.
876000	887600	Maybe there had been more folk politic-ish de-growth elements dominating the movement before, but I think this is heavily changing, actually.
887600	899700	I'm right now in the process of co-editing a volume on democratic economic planning together with Christoph Sorg and there's Matthias Schmelzer, Elena Offerberthe and Cédric Durand together writing a chapter
900500	906100	which will address democratic planning in connection to de-growth.
906100	911000	So I think these things are kind of coming together.
911000	925000	Yeah, and I've actually brought this up before where Jason Hickel sometimes defined de-growth as a democratic planned reduction of material throughput in the global north or something like that.
925100	931900	But to me, those three words, democratic planned reduction, to me really raised some serious questions.
931900	937000	Let's absolutely get into that because I'm interested in the questions.
937000	947900	To me, if you're already saying there's a reduction, you're actually foreclosing the democratic part because I think the democratic part is for socialists.
948000	956100	The most important part, which is that we democratically debate over, you know, we call socialism production for social need.
956100	974200	So the question of what we need collectively as a society and what is enough for a good life and what types of sectors we do want to expand, this is up to democratic deliberation.
974200	986300	And whether or not we would want to reduce the amount of material and energy use in that plan democratic like that shouldn't already be determined.
986300	1003100	You know, again, like there's a lot of poverty around the world and we very much if we were, you know, my socialist perspective is this idea that capitalism actually limits us incredibly in what we can produce and what we can do for people
1003100	1007600	because it it only allows us to produce what's profitable for investors.
1007600	1022100	So if we were actually come into a place where we had democratic planning overproduction and we're going to already say, well, we have to reduce how much how much material and energy use we use that like that doesn't seem particularly democratic.
1022100	1024500	And to me, it's a real challenge.
1024500	1043500	And again, I'll go back to this north south thing like a lot of the the problem of poverty in the global south, but also, as I'd say, again, in the global north is is not really a matter of just taking some energy consumption up in the north and bringing it down to the to the south and transferring it.
1043500	1046900	Right. It's a it's about a fundamental lack of infrastructure.
1046900	1054300	And so, you know, there are close to a billion people around the planet that have no access to electricity.
1054300	1060200	And the World Bank thinks we'll just like give each little hut a solar panel and a battery and call it done.
1060200	1068100	But no, I think, again, if we're a socialist, we would want to build like an actually viable electricity grid all over the world.
1068100	1073400	Like people deserve the type of electricity that we just take for granted.
1073400	1082400	Right. And people need modern sanitation infrastructure, you know, like sewage treatment, like plumbing, like these types of things.
1082400	1085000	And again, you don't take that from the north.
1085000	1088500	You just you have to build the infrastructure in the first place.
1088500	1101300	And like I said before, it's, you know, there's some fundamental infrastructure problems even in a rich country like the United States and the south where people don't have sanitation.
1101300	1105300	The problem of climate change is we have to rebuild an entirely new grid system.
1105300	1110400	So it's not again, it's not like you can just take from this preexisting material and energy use.
1110400	1115600	So so, again, I do think, oddly, it's capitalism that limits us.
1115600	1128900	And if we were to take control over production, we would want to be free to decide collectively how much we need, how much we need to grow or how much we need to degrow certain things and all those sorts of things.
1128900	1131600	OK, a lot of questions coming up there.
1131600	1139500	The first one would be, I mean, to a certain degree in the way that you framed it right now and I think to a higher degree, even though in the book,
1139500	1158500	I'd say that the way that you use a certain idea of progress as a goal, as a universal goal, I'd say, isn't that like in the same way as you rightly point out the predetermined closure of the democratic process?
1158500	1177000	If you say we need shrinking, isn't that kind of equally predetermining a certain idea of how, in this case, Western ideas of progress are situated as something to be wanted for other areas of the world?
1177000	1185500	And because this would be equally problematic because I like the point about, OK, we shouldn't predetermine the question of shrinking or not shrinking.
1185500	1187400	But this would equally apply in this case.
1187400	1202700	Absolutely. Yeah. And I shouldn't assume that much of the impoverished millions around the world, you know, would vote or would collectively decide to build, you know, modern electricity and sanitation systems.
1202700	1213700	But I would wager that those populations would love to have the kind of development that, again, we take for granted.
1213700	1220200	And most people around the world today are not isolated from modern infrastructure systems.
1220200	1226700	They see they have connections to what it looks like and what it can offer to populations.
1226700	1245700	So I think it's it's also very problematic to kind of assume that like rural poor people in the global south want to sort of remain sort of in this sort of like somewhat romantic idea of being in touch with the land and living in communal harmony.
1245700	1252200	And I think most people would love to have more secure access to electricity, modern sanitation systems.
1252200	1255200	But that's again, that's just a guess.
1255200	1275200	You would want there to be robust, political, democratic, you know, systems that could again collectively decide what kind of life and what kind of infrastructure people think are required to to actually get rid of this type of poverty and deprivation that exists.
1275700	1295700	Because I would argue, I mean, there's a obviously there's a large span between, you know, the idealization of like in touch with nature, communal life ish ideas and like highly modernist progressivism, like on the other end of the scale, so to speak.
1295700	1299200	So there's a huge range between those, I'd say.
1299200	1314200	And I think it kind of also brings us to a question that I had when engaging with your work, and that is you already mentioned that you think that the predetermined limit would be a way of undercutting the democratic process, so to speak.
1314200	1325200	And then, I mean, immediately the other question pops up, whether or not there are certain like metabolic limits that need to be taken into account.
1325200	1329200	I would guess you'd agree that there are.
1329200	1339200	And then the question would be how to incorporate this into the process without predetermining what should be done and what should not be done.
1339200	1346200	And I think a certain area within your proposal made this pop up again and again.
1346200	1360200	And that was this question of like unlimited energy supply, because you put this as a possibility equal to universal basic services in other areas of life for housing, stuff like that.
1360200	1368200	But in terms of housing, for example, universal basic services wouldn't mean that we have unlimited housing.
1368200	1376200	It would mean that we have like adequately comfortable housing for everybody as a right, but not unlimited.
1376200	1390200	So in an equal sense, if you argue for unlimited energy supply, this would also kind of hit the wall at some point when it comes to the question of limits of metabolism, metabolism.
1390200	1393200	So how do you bring these two together?
1393200	1411200	So first thing, I think, I think, again, a democratic collective sort of planning would have to take into account the ecological constraints or limits under which we live.
1411200	1428200	And so you would hope, again, that that democratic planning process would be informed by robust science that is sort of trying to ascertain, you know, what actually we can take from nature without destroying it.
1428200	1445200	Right. And and again, I just would point out that we live in a world today where that kind of worse scientific understanding of limits and forming production just does not happen at all because productions organized for profit and very short term profits.
1445200	1448200	And so there's there's very little of that going on today.
1448200	1471200	So I do think degrowth people and environmentalists generally take a pretty sort of rigid vision of limits where they, you know, like there's been this science that's come out on like these planetary boundaries that are, you know, oftentimes people represent them as these entirely fixed static things.
1471200	1476200	But, you know, there's a lot of debate on the nature of these limits and these boundaries.
1476200	1491200	And one thing you can say about capitalism is that there have there have been serious limits, metabolic limits that because of capitalism's relentless kind of technological change have just been shot through.
1492200	1500200	You know, I studied nitrogen and like there was a lot of people worried about the limits of nitrogen and soil fertility in the late 19th century.
1500200	1506200	And then we came up with Haber-Bosch and it's just it's completely not not an issue anymore.
1506200	1520200	So, again, a more and you can call it progressivist or whatever, but a more sort of classical socialist perspective is that, first of all, capitalism limits us entirely like incredibly again, but also that
1520200	1536200	that limits are not fixed or static, that they can be superseded through technical, you know, to say it in the most crude way, developing the productive forces to to come up with new ways of producing things.
1536200	1547200	So let's look at the question of energy, which I think you're right is fundamentally limited, particularly when you look at our energy system now that's still to this day.
1547200	1555200	And again, we're losing the climate struggle because for about the last 20 years, the global share of energy and fossil fuels has remained static.
1555200	1557200	It's about 80 percent. Right.
1557200	1565200	And 80 percent of that means 80 percent of our global primary energy consumption comes from a limited resource.
1565200	1568200	Right. That's there's a finite amount of fossil fuels.
1568200	1576200	And that is a really serious limit to any kind of civilization that wants to base their energy on that source.
1576200	1583200	And there are other sources of energy that have, you know, debatable limits.
1583200	1603200	And, you know, some have argued that if you want to take a pro renewables perspective, like the amount of sun and wind that is harnessable on the earth on any given day is about, you know, many times over the level of global energy demand at all times.
1603200	1611200	So there's there, you know, when you look at renewables, there's this kind of abundance that could be harnessed in particular ways.
1611200	1625200	There are other, again, technical options that, you know, you know, people dream of nuclear fusion power, which would create a kind of inexhaustible energy.
1625200	1630200	So I don't want to be the person that said, oh, we have limitless energy.
1630200	1633200	No, I think it's contextual.
1633200	1642200	Right. And right now we're in a big pickle, a big problem because we are rooted in an energy regime that is limited fossil fuels.
1642200	1658200	But we could I think, again, I'm pretty optimistic that with social control over the means of production, we could shift towards a more flexible energy regime that could provision everyone's needs at a comfortable level.
1658200	1666200	Now, the other thing you brought up is and again, this is a good example I've been using lately about why context matters.
1666200	1668200	We are in Quebec right now.
1668200	1672200	Right. And I have a friend who lived in Quebec, I believe in Montreal.
1672200	1675200	And she joked to me and she studied electricity.
1675200	1677200	She wrote an incredible book.
1677200	1680200	I met her. I should name her. Her name is Gretchen Bakke.
1680200	1684200	She wrote a book called The Grid, which is really I learned so much about electricity.
1684200	1692200	And she joked to me once that here in Quebec and if I'm right, she lived in Montreal for a while here in Quebec.
1692200	1708200	They have so much cheap hydro, so much cheap hydro power that hydro Quebec that everyone just has like totally inefficient space heaters in their homes, like these like baseboard electric resistance heaters.
1708200	1709200	And they just crank it up.
1709200	1710200	You know, it's cold here.
1710200	1713200	They just crank it up because it's just they have so much energy.
1713200	1715200	It's just abundant energy.
1715200	1721200	And, you know, hydro has a lot of land use problems and some emissions associated with it.
1721200	1724200	But it's it's also seen as somewhat clean and carbon free.
1724200	1732200	So people have this sort of abundant clean energy and they're just that, you know, it feels like limitless to in that context.
1732200	1738200	And it's not having a huge impact on climate change that people are just like churning this electric heat.
1738200	1746200	And but then I was in Germany actually this fall and I talked to a friend who who kind of gave a different example.
1746200	1762200	If you have like the DDR in East Germany that actually was taking this, you know, whatever somewhat heavy handed state socialist investment in much more efficient forms of living like collective housing and public transit.
1762200	1769200	And, you know, environmentalists would all be supportive of this kind of much more low energy use, compact cities, compact living.
1769200	1777200	But and so they had a much more like not like these Quebec people, like, you know, just inefficiently wasting energy.
1778200	1792200	But but but because the DDR was basically hooked up to a grid powered by coal, dirty, dirty coal, that that the environmental impact of that more efficient way of living was way worse than this.
1792200	1797200	This is just like excessive wasteful Quebec energy use.
1797200	1807200	So again, the context really matters, you know, when you have clean, abundant energy, you can have much more freedom to do whatever you want.
1807200	1817200	When you have dirty, even if it's dirty, abundant energy and you're trying to use it efficiently, you can still have a horrible impact on the environment.
1818200	1832200	Let's maybe dig a little bit deeper into this consumption side of things, because I think you make a very good point when pointing out that it's not about individualized guilt.
1832200	1854200	So that's a technique of power, maybe, so to speak, that is being deployed upon us by basically by the capitalist class in all types of ways in order maybe to distract from what should happen, which is questioning the ownership of means of production, as you rightly point out.
1854200	1860200	So I think you make a very fair point when it comes to that, and you can talk about that as well.
1860200	1869200	But I would like to attach something to this point that you're making there, while you're rightly pointing out that this individualized guilt is not the way to go.
1870200	1886200	I also am asking myself if it's the right way to go to stick to what is, from a critical perspective, being called a consumerist society.
1886200	1903200	And I get the point that you're saying, okay, for a whole bunch of people, they are absolutely not in the position where one could rightly point towards less consumption because they are simply poor and need a higher living standard.
1903200	1920200	But still, there's this element of a certain type of consumerist culture that is also part of a certain type of fetish that we are being fed for means of profiting.
1920200	1929200	So I think a simple linear continuation of this consumerist mindset is equally not the way to go.
1929200	1933200	And maybe you could steer us through these areas.
1933200	1951200	Yeah, for some reason, my argument sometimes gets interpreted as, because we're not criticizing consumption, we want to just maintain and keep American-style mass consumption as it is.
1951200	1971200	And then seize production so that we can just extend American-style consumption to the whole world, which would not be a very socialist perspective because, again, I would argue that American-style consumption is, and I talk about this in the book, where I call it privatized provisioning.
1971200	1986200	It's a highly inefficient, privatized mode of living where you have people spread about and reliance upon single-family private housing and private automobiles.
1986200	1994200	And this is not a rational use of resources from a socialist planning perspective in my view.
1994200	2002200	And that a socialist perspective would obviously want to collectivize consumption in all these ways that would bring people together and collective housing.
2002200	2009200	And you said you live in Vienna and collective housing, so this is something I think is inspiring.
2009200	2023200	And I think the Green New Deal vision, when it was very ascendant in the United States with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others, it was this vision of public luxury.
2023200	2043200	So this is kind of like, I think, a socialist vision is, again, more sort of actually changing the conversation over what is the good life, over what do we need as a society, and restructuring not just production, but all of society.
2043200	2050200	So, again, production for social need is not just about productions, about what we need on the consumption side.
2050200	2066200	And that said, again, there are parts of the American way of life, like, again, secure electricity access, modern food refrigeration type services, sanitation, plumbing.
2066200	2071200	These are things, I think, that everyone, if they want, if they should have.
2071200	2088200	I mean, maybe just a quick question. Coming from the degrowth perspective, I mean, one big point when it comes to what you sometimes seem to slightly hint towards when it comes to technical fixes and how far they might reach.
2088200	2096200	And you pointed towards how much energy wind and solar might potentially produce stuff like that.
2096200	2103200	From a degrowth perspective, the argument which would then be broad is this question of decoupling, I think.
2104200	2127200	So it might be that there is so much sun energy coming onto the earth, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we can produce mechanisms for the collection of this energy in a way that leads to a point where you will have the decoupling of growth and raising destruction of the earth, so to speak.
2127200	2139200	So whether or not this is possible, it's actually a crucial point when it comes to this question of where to imagine and negotiate limits, let's say.
2139200	2168200	Yeah, and unfortunately, I think the decoupling conversation is always sort of in relationship to GDP growth, which is, again, a kind of statistical construction of a capitalist economy is growing as healthy, but to me obscures that it's really about capitalist profiting and investing that leads to GDP growth.
2168200	2183200	So it's sort of like a proxy measure of whether or not capitalists are investing in hiring people and accumulating capital, and that's kind of what really drives a capitalist society.
2183200	2201200	And so, again, we would not want a socialist society to be basically measured by GDP growth, so the question of whether or not you can decouple from GDP growth is not particularly important from a socialist perspective.
2201200	2214200	The question is, again, can we provide for social needs without destroying the ecological conditions? And I think, again, I'm pretty optimistic that we could.
2214200	2239200	We could, and there's lots of examples of how, again, that case of big, cheap, abundant hydro providing for tremendous amounts of energy consumption without the same kinds of impacts you would have if you were to be channeling a coal-based form of consumption on that.
2239200	2241200	So again, it really matters.
2241200	2256200	I mean, but one element of your argument is that there's not hydro energy everywhere equally, so then the follow-up question would be, I mean, in the case of solar, for example, there are certain elements that go into the production of these panels and stuff like that.
2256200	2266200	And all these things are not abundant in a way that we'll be able to collect all of the energy for like quadrupled energy consumption of the Earth.
2266200	2289200	So there is a relation that goes beyond the question of GDP growth, but relates to the question of whether or not the production of energy has follow-up environmental costs, not monetary costs, but environmental costs that need to be taken into account when thinking about how abundant the use of energy can at the end be.
2289200	2302200	Yeah, I'm actually very not as optimistic about renewable solar and wind energy as I suggested before for a whole lot of other reasons.
2302200	2313200	But one thing I can say that's good about them is, you know, with fossil fuels, you dig up this stuff from the Earth and you burn it and it's gone.
2313200	2316200	You know, it's like this combustion-based energy system.
2316200	2328200	But with these minerals you speak of, and they're significant, you do dig them up, you put them into these panels or the turbines, and these systems work for decades.
2328200	2342200	You know, so there is a different type of material flow that goes into these renewable systems than goes into the fossil fuel economy that needs to be stated clearly.
2342200	2350200	But you're right, you know, I'm more concerned honestly about the land use that it takes for these resources.
2350200	2356200	One good thing about fossil fuel is you dig deep into the Earth to get it.
2356200	2361200	You don't take up a whole lot of territory or land to get that energy, incredible energy.
2361200	2368200	Energy scholars call it power density, how much power you're generating per square meter of territory.
2368200	2374200	And fossil fuels are pretty good for giving you tremendous energy with not using much land.
2374200	2383200	And so we to just think we're just going to like basically like, you know, there's just been a recent estimate that to get to net zero,
2383200	2392200	the United States has to put solar panels on the territory that would equal like several states combined, you know, wind turbines over several, you know,
2392200	2397200	like we're talking about huge to act like we can just like do that.
2398200	2405200	We're just like plopping things down on tremendous territory like that's a that's a huge concern.
2405200	2420200	But again, I feel like this idea that we can decide ahead of time like what these particular material constraints are is not is a historical and not
2420200	2426200	in line with what we know how history has shown, which is when there are limits to some certain resource there,
2426200	2436200	there are technical changes that vastly expand those limits and often just sort of shoot through them.
2436200	2446200	So if there's a particular mineral that is becoming scarce for the energy economy, there could be a way to find a different one.
2446200	2457200	And if those again, I think the more serious question is if the extraction of those minerals are starting to really destroy the kind of more broader ecological systems
2457200	2468200	that we rely on to survive, like water systems and, you know, basically, you know, even let's talk about biodiversity conservation.
2468200	2478200	Like then, you know, then you can start to talk about, you know, scaling back that kind of extraction to not, you know, gobble up ecology as a whole.
2478200	2489200	But I think, again, it again, if we had more social control, this kind of planning would have to always be responding dynamically to ecological problems over here
2489200	2502200	and concerns and changing the production system in accordance in that sometimes this degrowth debate is often about like sort of deciding once and for all if decoupling is possible or not.
2502200	2506200	But again, I think a lot of it's going to be contextual.
2506200	2515200	Still wondering a bit how much you rely on this idea of possible technical fixes that might come about or might not.
2515200	2521200	But you kind of pivot to the point of we'll have to see and decide democratically.
2521200	2526200	So I have two bigger things that I wanted to ask you.
2526200	2533200	Let's start with the science thing, because you kind of hinted towards that area in your last answer as well.
2533200	2546200	Well, I mean, one thing that really comes off as weird for me within the larger climate movement is and maybe I'm too generalizing here.
2546200	2555200	But anyway, is the like implicit scientism that is carried along oftentimes within the arguments.
2555200	2563200	And I mean, the general like, listen to the science slogan, it never really worked for me.
2563200	2573200	And I always wondered if it's just a strategic way of trying to use an appeal of authority coming from science,
2573200	2583200	which I would understand for like a youth movement that in the eyes of the broader society is like looked down upon as well.
2583200	2588200	But do they know these kids, blah, blah, blah, blah, which is a stupid thing to say.
2588200	2600200	And then to kind of trying to use some of the like societal authority of science in trying to strategically make your point.
2600200	2607200	This is something I would probably understand for a moment, you know, to carry along.
2607200	2618200	But in general, I think it's really problematic to base your movement and your point on this type of appealing to the science in singular,
2618200	2626200	as if, as you said before in one of your answers, as if these things were set in stone through some objective fact.
2626200	2628200	And because that's not the way it goes.
2628200	2635200	It's not science if anybody tells you that it cannot be any different, because that's the essence of science.
2635200	2642200	These are competing knowledges that that fight for the interpretation of things, you know.
2642200	2647200	So I'm just interested in your in your thoughts about this.
2647200	2657200	Well, in the book, I argue that it's it's a very particularly form of class politics on the part of what I call the professional class.
2658200	2668200	I've talked about the professional managerial class, which for that class, like education, meritocracy, sort of being smart are kind of like very important,
2668200	2676200	kind of self-identity, identity defining kind of aspects of your entire sort of orientation towards the world.
2676200	2690200	So in that sense, I argue that that really looking at climate change as a issue of the science and what the science is saying becomes sort of existential to these highly educated people who really take science seriously.
2690200	2706200	And and so, you know, what what I argue is that that, you know, clearly the the people in control of the energy system saw pretty early on the 1990s that if the science became clearer on climate change,
2706200	2710200	then society might want to do something about it, which would attack their interests.
2710200	2726200	So the fact that the fossil fuel industry started funding these sort of skeptical scientists who would be uncertain about the reality of climate change was a in my view, like a media strategy, a kind of power strategy on the part of the fossil fuel industry.
2726200	2739200	And but this kind of offended the kind of professional class climate activists so much that they wanted to focus totally on the fossil fuel industry's role in sowing climate denial, climate uncertainty.
2739200	2756200	And to me, in many ways, sort of made a kind of mountain out of a molehill where, you know, most of what the fossil fuel industry does is, you know, materially invest in fossil fuel energy projects that they want to generate profit off profits off.
2756200	2762200	And they also are spending much more of their time organizing political power.
2762200	2769200	You know, the sort of big climate villains in the U.S. are the Charles and David Koch, the Koch brothers.
2769200	2782200	And they literally set up something called the American Legislative Exchange Council that literally wrote legislation and bills for state level legislatures that they would just send them the bill and then they would pass it.
2782200	2788200	And so they were, you know, donating to campaigns amassing huge political power.
2788200	2791200	You know, on the side, you know, funding some science denial, right?
2791200	2796200	But the liberal climate people are just like all they want to talk about is the science denial.
2796200	2802200	And they aren't seeing that this isn't really a struggle over facts and science.
2802200	2805200	It's really a struggle over power and political power in particular.
2805200	2812200	And you can point out how dastardly these fossil fuel interests are for denying the science.
2812200	2816200	But that's not necessarily going to give you any more power.
2816200	2818200	I think I quoted that.
2818200	2819200	What's his last name?
2819200	2822200	He wrote a book called Hegemony How To.
2822200	2827200	And he has this great line where he says, right does not equal might.
2827200	2833200	Like being right, being correct scientifically does not equal political might or power.
2834200	2842200	And for this class of people, they kind of sometimes collapse into this sort of liberal worldview where we're just going to debate the ideas
2842200	2848200	and come to a consensus about the truth about climate change and then we're going to act.
2848200	2853200	And if it weren't for this horrific denial, we would be acting already.
2853200	2856200	But again, even if 100 percent of Americans believed in the science,
2856200	2861200	that does not guarantee we're going to embark on a process of shifting off of fossil fuels.
2862200	2870200	So, yeah, again, I think it creates a pretty ineffectual type of politics that isn't really concerned with power.
2870200	2876200	It's about concerned with being smart and being right, which is not going to win.
2876200	2885200	OK, we will get to the class struggle after one last question on how to situate your ideas.
2885200	2899200	Because I think that the most difficult element within your argument for me to understand why you stick to it or why you bring it forward was this
2899200	2902200	was this notion of the good Anthropocene.
2902200	2914200	And the reason why I'm skeptical is that I don't think that it's a good idea to reinstate the human as a sovereign over nature.
2914200	2921200	Again, because this is an element of modernism, frankly, to to be overcome, I think,
2921200	2930200	and that it's that it's a nucleus of the the way in which we relate to nature in an in an extractive logic.
2930200	2941200	Because, I mean, there's a like closeness between the two between the idea of sovereignty over nature and this logic of extractivism.
2941200	2951200	And within this idea of good Anthropocene, to me, it seems as if it's a bit of a weird logic that says, OK,
2951200	2959200	we just need to get into control even more and then use it cleverly and then everything will work out.
2959200	2961200	But that's not how it works.
2961200	2970200	I think in order to really bring about the change that you argue for, there will need to be a change in position as well on the part of humans.
2970200	2980200	And the change in position would be a change towards more and more relational understanding when it comes to nature,
2980200	2990200	instead of this dichotomy between nature, culture and the sovereign, the human as a sovereign that controls nature, even in a good way.
2990200	3002200	I think another element where you point towards is this Marxian notion of the how is it called Bonaparte familias or something like that?
3002200	3003200	Yeah.
3003200	3004200	Bono's part of familias.
3004200	3012200	And I mean, come on, this is not the relation we should have towards nature, because it's a hierarchical relation towards nature.
3012200	3019200	And it implies a certain way of subjugation, so to speak.
3019200	3021200	Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure.
3021200	3027200	You know, the good Anthropocene is a phrase from an article by Lee Phillips and Mikhail Rozhevsky.
3027200	3031200	And I'm not sure how wedded I am to that frame.
3031200	3032200	You do.
3032200	3033200	I cite them.
3033200	3034200	Yeah.
3034200	3036200	But mostly because they're calling for planning.
3036200	3037200	Right.
3037200	3039200	And planning against the market.
3039200	3051200	And so what I would say is that, again, we live in a world today where we just are helpless.
3051200	3055200	We're actually out of control over our relationship to nature, right?
3055200	3066200	We just see the world burning and we act like we can't do anything about it because there's this thing called the economy that is allowed to just be this naturalized market that just does its thing.
3066200	3072200	If the market says, like it said in 2022, that fossil fuels are as profitable as they've really ever been.
3072200	3075200	You know, coal right now is experiencing a boom in profits.
3075200	3077200	I mean, how are we allowing that?
3077200	3079200	We're just saying, well, stocks are up.
3079200	3081200	That's what the market says.
3081200	3083200	And we just say we can't control it.
3083200	3091200	Right. And so the impulse to plan means we want to take control over our relationship to nature and plan that relationship.
3091200	3093200	Now, I totally hear you.
3093200	3099200	There's this there is longstanding modernist Western problems with the kind of, you know, it goes all the way back to the Bible.
3099200	3103200	This could like subjugate nature, control it.
3103200	3108200	I don't have, you know, I'm not wedded to that subjugating vision.
3108200	3115200	I would maybe frame it as one of more focused on stewardship, which I think that Marx quote is really about.
3115200	3120200	Like we want to we want to be stewards of the earth and pass it on.
3120200	3128200	I think he talks about passing on an earth to generation after generation in a good state and that.
3128200	3139200	But, you know, I think being good stewards of the natural world, allowing biodiversity to thrive in ways it's not right now would require planning, right?
3139200	3143200	Will require some sort of control over our economic system.
3143200	3152200	And again, when it's necessary, limiting the economic activity in certain areas so that we can allow nature to thrive.
3152200	3169200	And, you know, that's that's why I actually, you know, sometimes this sort of perspective that gets associated with eco modernism or eco, I find somewhat attractive because they actually say like we want things like dense cities
3169200	3173200	where people live and like collective housing and dense public transit.
3173200	3183200	We want this kind of efficient human living so that we can allow nature to thrive elsewhere, like free up land, free up biodiversity elsewhere.
3183200	3198200	And that's why they advocate, you know, you know, again, like they advocate highly efficient industrial agriculture so that the land footprint of agriculture is very small so that there can be more land for nature and wilderness and biodiversity.
3198200	3209200	And things like this. So I would take the position that, you know, the the more we can plan our economy, the more we can choose collectively.
3209200	3221200	You know what? Again, broken record what we need, but also what we what kind of natural biodiverse world we also want to we want to exist.
3221200	3232200	And, you know, we have like it or not, humans have consciousness and we can plan to, you know, we we've already shown we can we can have, you know, nature preserves.
3232200	3238200	We can set aside nature if we want to. Right. And so bringing in planning is going to have a certain type of control.
3238200	3248200	Now, while I probably would distance myself from the kind of hyper modernist sort of domineering subjugation vision, I would not.
3248200	3269200	Again, I'm very much a defender of modernism in general in in Marx, too, you know, and socialists were really they, you know, in Marx's time, like they actually saw what modern industrialization was doing was creating a kind of productive capacity that didn't exist in human history.
3269200	3281200	That prior to the Industrial Revolution, you know, Friedrich Engels would say, like, you know, class and poverty were material necessities because there just wasn't enough production to go around.
3281200	3298200	And, you know, 90 plus percent of society lived through agricultural labor, really brutal forms of subjects talk about subjugation, brutal forms of slavery, serfdom and horrific subjugation where tiny minorities were able to live in this kind of luxury.
3298200	3319200	So what the what capitalism, they argued what capitalism does is it develops production to such a crazy level that we for the first time in human history have the possibility of abolishing poverty and and again, really planning and choosing our relationship to nature in a much more conscious and careful way.
3319200	3332200	And that and also like it gives the productive capacity is so high that it at least creates the possibility that we could live in a society where people have way more time than they've ever had.
3332200	3344200	You know, again, agrarian societies were very labor intensive and people didn't have a lot of time. Our capitalist society, people are always exhausted and stretched thin and not having enough time.
3344200	3363200	So the vision of socialism as one of free time really hinges on, you know, again, this this idea from Marx and socialists that industrial production systems have such high capacity that we could actually harness them in ways that free up society as a whole to have free time.
3363200	3371200	And and and and more time also for that kind of nitty gritty collective democratic planning, which takes time. Right.
3371200	3389200	And and so so definitely I wouldn't throw out the modernist baby with the with the domineering subjugating bathwater because I do think if you're you know, in the 19th century or early 20th century, if you were a Marxist or a socialist, you were a modernist.
3389200	3397200	You were you you had this sort of progressive view that capitalism actually creates the material conditions for emancipation of all of humanity.
3397200	3405200	And I think things are pretty dark right now, but I still kind of fundamentally believe that we live in a world that has that possibility still.
3405200	3414200	OK, let's maybe dive a little into the question of how because we didn't talk too much about that yet.
3414200	3418200	But yeah, it's a really, really, really, really important question.
3418200	3432200	So, I mean, and that's like a strong base of your argument is that many of the movements might have interesting ideas and good values, so to speak.
3432200	3441200	But we need more than that. We need an idea of how to get into positions of power that are able to bring about this change.
3441200	3443200	Yeah. How do we get that?
3443200	3452200	Well, again, it unfortunately, you know, we've lived in a society where capital has been all powerful for about five decades.
3452200	3455200	We've called it neoliberalism.
3455200	3465200	I've often quoted Adolf Reed, the socialist in the United States, often defines neoliberalism as capitalism without a labor opposition.
3465200	3480200	And that's essentially what we had a really powerful labor working class movements, labor parties, political parties and labor unions that built up all this power in the 20th century.
3480200	3487200	And by the 1970s, capital had basically got fed up and they crushed the power of those movements systematically.
3487200	3497200	Right. And now we live in a society where capital is all powerful and working class movements are sort of animized and demobilized and all this stuff.
3497200	3505200	But I come at this from a much, you know, again, a more traditional Marxist view that that argues that working class power is not only contingent.
3505200	3516200	It is objective to a capitalist system that capitalism actually objectively creates this majority that lives in insecure material existence.
3516200	3523200	In fact, capital requires that sort of production of a proletarianized, insecure population.
3523200	3527200	Otherwise, people would not show up to work.
3527200	3536200	So this sort of disciplining of the market that you have to work to starve really feeds into capital's power as a whole.
3536200	3544200	But it also creates this huge majority of society that has this material interest in transformation.
3544200	3554200	But that does not guarantee that that interest can be organized or that workers are even collectively conscious of that power that they have.
3554200	3561200	And the other part is that workers obviously have power because they do the work and society depends on.
3561200	3570200	We found out about this in the pandemic where we suddenly were talking about these essential workers and that society doesn't function unless these workers.
3570200	3586200	And lo and behold, it was the most sort of precarious and seen as like disposable, often immigrant workers that do like the nitty gritty work of reproducing society and service sectors and health care sectors.
3586200	3593200	And even then, you know, again, transit and manufacturing and these kind of people that keep society running.
3593200	3606200	But those those people have tremendous power just by the fact that if they do go on strike, they can create a crisis and force elites to answer to those demands.
3606200	3614200	I mean, we've seen this recently where in West Virginia in 2018, the teachers went on strike.
3614200	3621200	They shut down the entire state school system. They created a whole crisis. We've learned in COVID how schools are so important to social reproduction.
3621200	3626200	They shut down social reproduction and they won their demands in about two weeks in a red state.
3626200	3631200	And that's power, right? That's power that workers have. And they didn't just do it by going on strike.
3631200	3636200	They organized with parents and communities to kind of get them on board with this politics.
3636200	3639200	It was fundamentally about really investing in education.
3639200	3645200	Like they wanted smaller class sizes. They wanted more classroom space and things like this.
3645200	3649200	You know, in the United States, rail workers threatened to go on strike this past fall.
3649200	3660200	And it led the most powerful people in the administration to basically pull all-nighters to try to prevent this from happening because they know that I think they're actually terrified of what would happen
3660200	3667200	if these rail workers learned about their power. Like what if they did shut down the rail system in the height of the holiday season?
3667200	3676200	What would that do to the working class movement? This summer, we might have 350,000 UPS workers go on strike for a good contract.
3676200	3682200	And again, we live in a country where strike activity just fell off a cliff in 1980.
3682200	3686200	Like basically, strike activity was really high in the whole postwar period.
3686200	3692200	It spiked in the 1970s. And then with this kind of neoliberal onslaught, it just fell off a cliff.
3692200	3698200	And so one union leader told Jane McAlevey that strikes are like a muscle.
3698200	3703200	If you don't use it, it kind of atrophies. You forget how to use this power.
3703200	3709200	And so I do think workers were going to have to like relearn, reorganize that power.
3709200	3719200	And so anyway, to me, like this leads to that, I think I mentioned before, this kind of two pronged strategy where in order to, you know,
3719200	3725200	I do think we're probably not going to win socialism like tomorrow, right?
3725200	3735200	But we can win state power through, again, trying to harness this majoritarian power of the working class as the vast majority of society in the United States.
3735200	3739200	In the United States, I use this measure that basically says about 63 percent.
3739200	3744200	You take out the professionals, the managers, the small business people.
3744200	3750200	You know, it's about two thirds of society that's really in this sort of broader working class, multiracial working class.
3750200	3761200	And if you can start to construct a majoritarian politics that can appeal to that majority, you can maybe in a parliamentary democracy start to win state power.
3761200	3766200	And to me, like and people like Andrea's mom have said the same Christian parenti.
3766200	3774200	If you think about the scale of the climate crisis and what needs to be done at the speed we need it, it's hard to imagine you achieve all that without state power.
3774200	3780200	You know, the state can not only invest in the new infrastructure, which states that's what states often do.
3780200	3787200	They they build public infrastructure that society needs, that capital doesn't find profitable to invest in.
3787200	3791200	But also states can discipline capital.
3791200	3801200	States can can actually be, you know, can actually take a more confrontational approach toward the fossil fuel industry and start to really aggressively phase out that industry.
3801200	3804200	So we've got to win state power.
3804200	3809200	You know, we took a gambit at it with like this Bernie Sanders and that sort of crested.
3809200	3820200	And so we're back into this real struggle of like of thinking about how we can build much more powerful movements that could harness state power in way more aggressive ways than the Inflation Reduction Act.
3820200	3829200	Because again, that's that's what not to fall back on the science, but the science does say we need radical, rapid transformation of our energy systems.
3829200	3835200	And so we're going to need a much more powerful movement to really channel the state in that way.
3835200	3841200	But again, we also need a power, more powerful labor movement and union movement.
3841200	3844200	And that's where I see really building up again.
3844200	3849200	You know, if it's electricity unions or building trade unions, that's great for the climate crisis.
3849200	3853200	But I think in a general sense, we just need a revived labor movement in general.
3853200	3861200	So if it's teachers going on strike, if it's UPS workers going on strike, if it's grad students who just want a union at my university.
3861200	3863200	Yay, grad students.
3863200	3879200	You know, wherever it is, if it's Starbucks workers, wherever we're sort of rebuilding a fighting democratic labor movement that learns that when you collectively organize, you can you have power and you can force the boss or the capitalist to kind of bend to your demands.
3879200	3883200	Like that's the kind of movement that we need to rebuild.
3883200	3895200	Because again, historically, there's just not a lot of evidence that other movements have been able to really have the kind of results that mass working class parties and unions really had in the 20th century.
3895200	3916200	So for pretty much 50 years, the left has sort of, you know, come out of this pretty, you know, we were pretty disillusioned with the ways in which the union movement and labor parties, social democratic parties became kind of internalized into capitalism and kind of deradicalized in all these ways.
3916200	3921200	So starting around the 70s, you know, people like Andre Gorges were like, farewell to the working class.
3921200	3927200	We're going to build a new kind of socialist politics that would be more like a movement of movements, right?
3927200	3932200	Like many different movements sort of coalescing into one general force that could take on capital.
3932200	3940200	I think we can now say after 50 years that that that movement of movements is just not really borne much fruit, right?
3940200	3943200	Neither has the labor movement, neither is anything, right?
3943200	3967200	So my position is that, you know, if we're still under capitalism, I believe that that there's this more sort of objective, if organized power that the working class has that we should go back to basics, organize parties, organize unions that fight and build collective power through like real institutions.
3967200	3978200	And again, even if these things aren't done in the name of climate change, if you have a more powerful labor movement, it's shown through history, you're going to have more wealth redistribution.
3978200	3980200	You're going to have higher taxes on the rich.
3980200	3989200	You're going to have much more ambitious programs of public investment on behalf of society, not just for capitalists, right?
3989200	3995200	And that's the kind of orientation towards public sector investment, redistributive state.
3995200	3999200	These are the kind of systems we actually need to address climate change.
3999200	4006200	So we got to build a kind of more general movement to get those things before I think we can address climate change at the scale we need to.
4006200	4014200	Wonderful. Matt, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests, and it is if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
4018200	4019200	Joyful.
4020200	4034200	I mean, OK, so, you know, I was born in 1978, so I feel like my adult or just my whole life has lived.
4034200	4042200	I've lived through this period of utter defeat for the left and for an utter victory for the capitalist class.
4042200	4050200	So as a historical thinker, I really do firmly believe in my heart that it can't keep being this bad.
4050200	4059200	And that history shows that, you know, you can only, you know, subjugate a population in society for so long before they fight back.
4059200	4065200	And so I really do think we're we're actually seeing green shoots of that fight back right now.
4065200	4067200	Actually, you know, Bernie Sanders is one thing.
4067200	4072200	It was kind of this like electoral magic show, like we're going to win socialism through elections somehow.
4072200	4077200	But it's really about organizing power, really more in workplaces and communities.
4077200	4079200	And that's what we're starting to see.
4079200	4083200	You know, in 2022, there's a record number of union organizing drives.
4083200	4087200	We've seen like a strike wave in the UK recently.
4087200	4093200	I really do think there's kind of what was it in the UK that had that that campaign?
4094200	4096200	I think that was called like enough is enough. Right.
4096200	4107200	Yeah. So like I do see like these green shoots of of a fighting working class movements that are sort of coming out of the ashes of neoliberalism.
4107200	4121200	So I that does bring me joy that we might for the next several decades actually have be parts of movements that actually have power to erode the power of capital, which has been all powerful for all these decades.
4121200	4125200	So that it does get me very excited and joyful.
4125200	4129200	Great. Matt, thank you so much for being part of future histories.
