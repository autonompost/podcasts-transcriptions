101760	102880	Welcome, Elisa.
103400	105920	Hi, my name is Elisa Longcón Antilio.
106360	114560	Hello to everybody.
115520	118720	I'm greeting you in my mother tongue.
119160	125280	That is very important for me and for my people that you hear my
125280	131960	voice in my mother tongue, because we are a virginal nation here in Chile.
132280	135800	And our language is losing today.
136200	138560	So it's our role to recover it.
139760	144200	Thank you to invite me to attend this meeting.
144840	145760	It's a great pleasure.
145800	146920	Thank you for being here.
147560	151800	For those who don't know anything about the constitutional process that has been
151800	157480	started in Chile in 2020, could you give us an overview of the process that was
157480	161480	set up for the collective development of the new Chilean constitution?
161720	163440	What was special about it?
163800	169560	Yeah, I want to tell you that it was a very important process for
169560	171200	a lot of the Chilean people.
171840	184200	It didn't start at 2020 because it's born from the social movement.
184320	193560	Long time ago, I want to mention 2006 with a student from high school.
193640	200960	They initiate a very big demands for public education at that time.
201480	212760	So the student from university, they was also in the mobilization and call all of
212760	215000	the social Chilean movement.
215120	225480	So we had a very, very hard social situation in 2019.
225880	234040	Million of people took the streets at that time, demanding social rights for the people.
234520	244040	So the government and the parliament called for a special meeting in order to establish
244120	253080	an accord, a political accord to have a referendum to change the Pinochet constitution.
253480	254960	So they did it.
255200	265160	And then in 2021, we created the first Constituent's Assembly.
267520	277280	That included a hundred and fifty five conventional and that include also the
277360	287720	priority, also the indigenous nations and all the social movements and political parties.
288120	298080	So we started to to wrote the new constitution and in one year we got it.
298560	305600	And then we have a new referendum in order to approve or refuse the proposal.
306120	311760	That proposal included the right for nature, right for indigenous people,
312480	320960	parity in the women, equality between women and men, social rights and all of them for all of the
321280	322840	aboriginal nation too.
323240	331560	So, but we had a bigger difficult situation because the citizenship rejected the new
331560	338600	proposal. It was rejected in September 4th last year.
340200	354000	But the main topic, why it was rejected was the fake news, hate discourses, the people who are in
354000	363840	the rejection position, they create a lot of misinformation about the constituent process,
363840	371200	about the conventionals and people fear to give the votes for that new constitution.
371640	378440	Some of the fake news was they said that they will lost the house.
379240	383360	There is no right for to have a house.
383720	393760	There is no right to have, for instance, social security or they said that the indigenous people
393760	402680	want to divide Chile and the indigenous people hate the Chilean people.
403120	410360	So those were hate discourses and people have feared about that.
410400	418240	So they rejected the constitution, the new proposal that we wrote at that time.
418960	429320	So the government called for a meeting with the parliament and they decided to improve the process
429840	433680	and call for the second constitutional process.
433960	442000	We are today in the second constitutional process, but they modify the representation of the people
442440	453440	because they include a no democratic way to to vote, to elect the conventionals.
454080	463560	And they decide that half of all of the team that will wrote the constitution,
463560	468640	that they must be designated by political parties.
469800	472880	There wasn't a democracy process.
473280	480120	So they they decided to include people from political parties,
480600	483000	exclude the indigenous people.
483840	497800	And then there was we had a new referendum to to vote for the half 50, 51, a conventional again.
498040	507600	We had it just two weeks ago and but there was not a special seat for indigenous.
508400	517920	The indigenous people elected one Mapuche person to to represent the the indigenous
517920	521400	interests inside the second process.
522400	536800	But the designated conventional, they are today as assessor, political is a political teams
537920	541040	experimenting in contention in constitution.
541840	553120	They draw the the proposal and inside that proposal, there wasn't there was not people.
554240	560040	There were no there were people, indigenous people inside the design.
560680	570520	So in that second frame, there is no participation of indigenous people today.
570640	580520	The elected people from the council, they will review that proposal, the second proposal.
580920	591400	But we don't we are not agree with the misrepresentation of the indigenous people.
592280	602040	And we will have a next at the end of this year, we will have the new referendum to in order to
602040	606440	decide if we approve or we reject the new proposal.
606520	614520	The new proposal today, we don't know how that's that proposal will include indigenous
614520	619080	right or mother nature rights or women's rights.
619200	627720	Those are the more difficult topic for the conservative parties.
628080	634280	Today, the voice is for the conservative parties.
634920	641640	Were there special obstacles within the process for the Chilean constitution?
642040	647080	Because if I remember correctly, I think in Bolivia, for example, they had a constitutional
647080	650160	process, and it was different than the one in Chile.
650480	656040	And if I remember correctly, then I think in some talk that you gave you, I think you stated
656120	663800	that the way that it was set up, that there was a referendum after the process with a with
663800	670320	this certain percentage that would have to be reached, that this was a special obstacle
670320	674280	within the process for the Chilean constitution.
674560	680640	Is that right? Am I remembering this correctly, or is it was it a very regular process, the
680640	682160	way it was set up in Chile?
682640	688560	No, there is there is not a regular process in Chile.
688720	697000	The constitutional discussion is a democratic constitutional discussion is a new process
697160	704880	today in Chile, because the last constitution was written by the dictatorship regime without
705920	707640	social participation.
708280	716400	So this is the last process that we did from twenty twenty one.
716440	723720	It was a really new process because included all of the social movement.
724080	732480	It was for the first time in the history of Chilean society that a half part of the
732480	735960	conventional were women, for instance.
736520	743560	There is no constitution written by women in any in here and outside of Chile.
743880	747760	So that is was a very, very important.
748040	754640	And that is that was the difference between the Bolivian process, the Bolivian constitutional
754640	762640	process or Ecuador, a constitutional process, because here the the participation of women
762640	771440	was really were in equal relationship between women and men in that first process.
771640	780120	But today seem are very different because the this expert commission elected by political
780120	791960	party, they avoid all of the topic that we included in the first process.
793200	797320	So today is really different from the first process.
799640	808640	And one thing that is also very important is in the first process, we include the plurinationality.
809120	821000	The plurinationality is a political proposal that born in the Bolivian process, also from
821000	829240	Ecuador process, the indigenous people there, they they they speak about the plurinationality.
829280	840120	And we as we are also Chile is have a diversity of nation nation here.
840440	849280	So we included like plurinationality as the political way to resolve the conflict between
849280	860120	the state and indigenous people to overcome genocide, racism, damage, coexistence, also
860120	869320	to recover all of the collective rights, because there is no political solution from
869320	881640	the state to resolve ancestral or historical problem that that did the creation of the
881680	889880	states with aboriginal nation, aboriginal nation didn't participate in the creation of
889880	897880	the states. So for the first time, we included and we said, OK, we are different.
898280	900800	There are diversity of nation here.
900800	908200	So all together will define the framework, the constitution for all of the Chilean people.
909080	912440	So that is what's really strong and very important.
913320	921640	But in this second process, they avoid the plurinationality because they said that the
921640	928280	people rejected. But I told you that people rejected because of hate discourse.
928360	933760	It was not true that we are going we hope to divide Chile.
933760	939400	We need a relationship, equal relationship with Chilean society.
939400	940400	That's all.
941000	948520	And when it comes to plurinationality, how does that work if there are like conflicting
948560	955320	rights, since if there are different nations within the nation, so to speak, and these
955320	961000	different nations have different ideas of, for example, how the question of rights should
961000	967840	be approached? Is there a way how to address it when there are different opinions that
967840	969480	clash with each other?
969640	976800	Because I imagine it wouldn't be a good idea to simply overrule one over the other.
976840	982880	But there needs to be a process of getting to an understanding of the different forms
982880	988320	of how rights are being conceptualized within the nations in the nation.
988760	992120	I'm not sure if this was a question that can be understood.
992880	1003680	Yeah, yes, yes, yes, I understand your question because people fear about the plurinationality
1003680	1013440	when they think that the indigenous will use the rights of the non-indigenous people.
1014520	1026120	And the question they did is, does the indigenous will have more rights than non-indigenous
1026120	1037720	people? You know, but there is no problem inside if you understand a lot of problem
1037720	1041720	that we had along the history with the indigenous.
1042080	1053760	The plurinationality first supports that Chilean society must recognize the pre-existence
1054040	1063520	of the indigenous because we were first here in that territory, then came the state.
1065240	1070720	The second point is, it's different to think about nations and state.
1071760	1075880	The state, it's an organization of nation.
1076840	1084960	But what happened with the internal colonialism inside the Chilean state?
1086520	1095960	They organized the state just with the white point of view, without the point of view of
1095960	1104640	indigenous people. So we have a long violation of human rights inside of our country.
1104800	1115080	We have genocide, the colonial project settled here in Chile and in America.
1115520	1123960	It was a genocide project that killed a nation, an aboriginal nation.
1124400	1132800	Not only nation, not only killed physically, they killed our culture, our language and
1132800	1136560	deprived us about our human rights.
1137280	1146760	We were not included as human inside the creation of the state from the beginning.
1147360	1158200	They said that we were like people from pre-logic, primitive, without conscience.
1159040	1165440	A lot of work in order to avoid our rights.
1165560	1174840	So your question is, we are in the 21st century and we are still alive today.
1176400	1179080	I am a teacher in the university.
1179080	1182360	I work every day with a Chilean student.
1182840	1185880	You know, my neighbor are Chileans.
1186480	1191480	So we need an equal relationship between them.
1192480	1202800	States, governments, after the dictatorship regime, they recognized that there was a
1202800	1210960	problem, historical problem, injustice problem inside of our state with indigenous people.
1211680	1217920	They create a law, they create a special commission in order to resolve that problem.
1218320	1225200	They vote in favor of the United Nations Declaration for Indigenous People, for
1225200	1227640	instance, or ELO Convention.
1228800	1236040	Our governments here give the votes in order to accept that ELO Convention that speaks
1236040	1239360	about a political right of indigenous people.
1240360	1243520	So, but what happened here in the country?
1244800	1254720	They, they erase the rights that they recognize internationally.
1255680	1264320	So what we need, we need those rights to be practices inside the country, inside the
1264320	1267600	society, and we need to live our rights.
1268440	1276320	I speaking about collective rights because they are individual rights and also collective
1276320	1279120	rights. Our rights are collective rights.
1279160	1285200	For instance, language is a collective rights because I can speak my language.
1285240	1289760	If I have, if I find somebody that is speaking my language, I need the collective.
1290800	1293480	Community is a collective right.
1293680	1296760	We the indigenous, we live in community.
1297080	1298800	We live with our family.
1299280	1304840	We have a big family because it connected with the community.
1305280	1306960	That is our collective right.
1307240	1309960	Autonomy and self-determination.
1311360	1313160	It's also a collective rights.
1313760	1318520	All of them was, were recognized by our governments.
1318880	1325480	So what we need today, we need to include it inside the law in order to live our right,
1325800	1332440	in order to, to, to be recognized as people, as human, you know?
1332920	1338760	So that's the topic that the Chilean people need to understand.
1339200	1346640	Those rights is not again the Chilean because we, we had our territory, but our
1346640	1354600	territory was occupied, but we need our territory in order to live and government
1354600	1360880	and a state have international instruments in order to solve that problem.
1362120	1366240	We need them, we needed to implement it.
1366520	1373760	And we are here talking about that topic in order to help to implement it.
1374200	1380440	The right, those rights collective that in our territory in democratic way.
1380960	1382880	This is the plural nationality.
1383200	1389640	So to resolve historical problem that have the state with the indigenous people in our
1389640	1394920	territory, using the democratic way of solution.
1395560	1396480	Very interesting.
1396640	1402880	One of the questions that I was asking myself when preparing is that on a certain level
1402920	1412440	that there seems to be a form of contradiction because you propose to use this element of a
1412680	1418520	constitution, of a constitutional convention in this case, of a constitution, which comes out
1418520	1423920	of a certain political tradition, a tradition of political theory as well.
1424240	1430240	And it is closely tied, for example, to a specific notion of subjects is and it's a
1430280	1434240	Western notion of subjects, a subject of reason.
1434240	1439600	You already pointed towards this, that is kind of underlying this notion of a
1439600	1440880	constitution as well.
1441120	1447600	And this is, of course, not unproblematic, because as you pointed out, indigenous people
1447600	1453120	were for a long time excluded from this notion of subject.
1453960	1460240	And I was wondering how these things can be brought together, because while there are
1460240	1467000	certainly aspects within this notion of subject that have served as a carrier, so to speak,
1467000	1474040	for also emancipatory projects, for example, broadly speaking, within a left humanist
1474320	1481040	project throughout history, this notion of subject has, of course, also been used as a
1481040	1487720	carrier for forms of domination and subjugation of other humans and also of nature.
1488480	1493720	So this has been an instrument of exclusion and oppression as well.
1493760	1501480	So my question would be, how can then a constitution, which is, as I said, an element of
1501480	1510120	Western political philosophy, you know, how can a constitution be thought of and enacted
1510400	1518200	without having to rely on this specific notion of a, let's say, liberal subject?
1518480	1520280	Yeah, yes.
1520400	1534360	So for us, I think that for all of the social movements around the world, we need to
1534360	1543080	understand that there is no, we are still keeping historical problems.
1545640	1559720	And the right wing, left wing, they promised to all of the society from all of the continent
1560480	1567000	that they will resolve the problem that we have in the society.
1568120	1571720	I'm speaking about Eurocentric philosophy.
1572520	1576280	I'm speaking about capitalism and about Marxism.
1578520	1587720	The idea of progress that it came to our continent is a political idea.
1588440	1590280	It's not an economical project.
1591720	1593400	It's an ideological project.
1596040	1609720	And European people believe at that time that with that solution, the progress inside of
1609800	1615240	our continent, they will solve the problem that we have here.
1616840	1622280	But progress never come to our territory.
1623560	1629000	Indigenous people, we are still, we are living without our rights.
1629000	1631160	I told you our collective rights.
1632120	1639720	Progress also doesn't solve the women rights.
1641000	1646920	Women were sacrificed by the progress ideology.
1646920	1651320	Indigenous was sacrificed by the progress ideology.
1652280	1661480	Nature was sacrificed by progress philosophy because they need to exploit it in order to
1661480	1665560	give social security for the people.
1665560	1670600	And that is not true because we don't, we are living without social security.
1671960	1677720	Indigenous people, there is no recognition of the right of women, for instance.
1677720	1696360	Women was considered like an inferior human from men, and men decide for women from the beginning.
1697240	1704920	I'm speaking about 1492 when the Spaniards came to our continent.
1705880	1712760	They did it in order to have a modernity in our continent.
1715160	1720920	But they sacrifice for the progress, sacrifice the people for the progress.
1722600	1732920	And Marxist ideology didn't say we have a violation of human rights
1733720	1735640	with that ideology.
1735640	1737000	They support the progress.
1738120	1744200	They support the progress because they said bourgeois are making progress.
1744200	1752120	We need that progress in order to resolve the, to have in the future unclass society.
1752120	1753320	But we need the progress.
1753880	1761000	They don't discuss the deep philosophy that was inside the progress.
1761160	1764840	Again, indigenous, again, against women.
1766600	1769800	Today we have those problems in everywhere.
1771400	1777320	So what we need today, we need to rethink about what we did in the past,
1778280	1787240	what the European culture did or philosophy, European philosophy did for all of the continent
1787240	1793720	because the progress born from Europe, it doesn't born from Africa.
1793720	1796120	It doesn't born from Latin America.
1797000	1800440	It was born in Europe.
1801480	1806280	And they use the ideology for all of the world.
1807240	1811800	Today the problem is in everywhere, in all the continent.
1811800	1814600	There is no solution for those, our rights.
1815320	1821240	So what we need today, we are in the 21st century.
1821240	1822520	We need to talk together.
1823080	1830440	We need to include diversity way of thinking because the colonial European Eurocentric
1830440	1834280	way of thinking doesn't give the solution to our problems.
1835160	1842120	And we support that there are philosophy, there are political models
1842840	1848760	or communitarian systems in our territory, inside of our society.
1849560	1858120	So we need to recover it in order to find together a plural solution
1858760	1863400	and include the plurality inside the democracy.
1863400	1867160	Because the democracies is defined by white people
1867160	1874920	and is defined by the idea of progress and democracy is still making sacrifice
1874920	1878680	of our people and also in everywhere.
1879560	1887080	So we need to modify our conception of state, our conception of constitution.
1888120	1894840	The way how to modify it is including the diversity, including different philosophy,
1895400	1901880	including all of our rights as human, individual and collective rights,
1901880	1906840	and also women's rights, but also nature rights.
1907720	1911240	Because we have other philosophy.
1911240	1915160	Indigenous people, we believe that nature is alive.
1915160	1922680	For instance, hers is alive and we need to be in relationship with nature.
1923640	1935080	And that's way of thinking is not include the right wing, neither in left wing.
1935880	1941240	So we need to talk, we need to share other way of thinking.
1942280	1949400	What would you say would be a good route to implement this different form of,
1949400	1957960	I would say, relationality towards nature for, in this case, in my case, for example,
1957960	1962760	for someone like me coming from a Western background.
1963560	1972360	Because I think that it's not a possibility to simply adopt Mapuche philosophy, for example,
1973320	1980520	because this is like a very different way, not only of thinking, but also
1981240	1989080	a philosophy that is enacted in a certain practice, as you already stated, rightly so.
1989800	1997480	And so for someone like me, for example, or for a constitutional convention in other countries,
1997480	2004440	let's say we would try to argue for a new constitution in Germany, where I come from,
2004440	2013000	and we would want to have a different form of relationality towards nature to be a part of this
2013000	2020360	new constitutional process and the constitution that will be brought about through this process.
2020360	2026760	We want a different form of relationality to nature to be inscribed into this constitution as well.
2027880	2037160	What would you say can be a framework that can be used for people that do not come from a
2037720	2044680	practice and from a also philosophical background that already has this different form of
2044680	2055240	relationality within it? How can we include it in processes that used to argue from a
2055240	2063880	perspective of Western philosophy, but will now have to develop into other forms of relation
2063880	2071480	towards nature as well? Do you have an idea of how to approach this task? Because it's a task
2071480	2076600	that is not only important for Chile, of course, it's important for the whole world, because
2077560	2084280	we can see how this very extractive logic, this logic of domination over nature,
2084280	2091960	how this is actually destroying the basis of our existence, and we need to find different ways to
2093160	2099880	relate it on a very foundational level. But it doesn't seem to happen somehow. Instead,
2099880	2109080	people are arguing for quick fixes without trying to really reflect upon this deeper relation.
2109560	2118280	I'm wondering if you have an idea of how to approach it in different contexts?
2118840	2130120	Yes. It's a very important question because we need to understand ourselves from a different
2130120	2142280	point of view. There are some theories that support diversity and plurality inside democracy,
2142920	2153320	but also there are a lot of practices that recognize ourselves connected because we are
2153320	2159720	not isolated inside the society. We need to have a critical point of view about development
2160200	2169880	I told you, but we also need to decolonize our mind, our practice, and we need to include a
2169880	2180680	new epistemology of the humankind way of thinking, because Eurocentric or European
2181560	2189640	philosophy, instead of European philosophy connected with capitalism, connected with
2189640	2196040	Marxism, I'm thinking about that kind of philosophy. It doesn't solve the problem.
2198440	2206840	We, as indigenous everywhere in every country, we have been in our territory
2207640	2216600	and using our own solution. We still keep our communitarian way of life. We are fighting to
2219080	2224120	protect our language because inside of our language, there is a philosophy inside. There
2224120	2228280	are a lot of knowledge that we need, so this is part of our struggle.
2228280	2238360	LW – But inside the big discussion, the global discussion, we need to problematize the
2238360	2247880	individualism that's born from the capitalist way of thinking. Today, the neoliberal system
2248840	2260200	destroyed the connection of the people, of human with the community. We are a member of a community.
2260200	2270680	We need to support the community inside of our life. Also, the topic about connecting with
2270680	2280120	the mother nature. We used to learn that, for instance, that the river is far from our
2280840	2290840	house, and we used to think about the water outside of us, the river outside of us,
2291560	2301560	wind outside of us. But what it is inside of our body? 75% of our body is water,
2302840	2314200	so the river is inside of us. What was the philosophy that supported the natural resource
2314920	2324520	are outside of the people? It was the capitalism system. It was the European philosophy
2325160	2341960	that just accept the rationality of man, not women. It's no difficult to include different
2341960	2349720	practice today, because we need that different practice inside of our family, inside of our life,
2349720	2359000	inside of our community, and inside of our country. On the contrary, we are not looking for the life
2359000	2368680	of ourselves, the life of my family, the life of the environment, because the pollution
2369640	2381160	is contaminated our life, so our environment, and there is no possibility to have life
2383160	2395240	in our place, in our space. We need to protect life, all kinds of life, our life, insect life,
2395720	2408280	animal life, because we need the biological diversity. We need it for the future of our humanity,
2409880	2422600	and all of the country, all of the culture in the world, we have the same environmental problem.
2423560	2432440	For instance, women problems, persecution of indigenous leaders, every, all of the country
2432440	2443640	have it, the discrimination, racial discrimination. So, my, the problem that the indigenous people
2444600	2449880	are have today in our community,
2452680	2461000	it's those problems you can also find it in your European, or in Europe, or in America, and everywhere.
2461560	2474760	So, but we need our, we need to pluralize our philosophy, our epistemology, and decolonize
2474760	2484120	our mind, because colonization put the one kind of way of thinking inside, like a rule for all of
2485080	2495800	the world, and that is not true. And within this process, what role does a constitution play,
2495800	2506520	or what role can it play in an ideal case? Because you have this plurality, but you also,
2506520	2518440	and that's like one possible role a constitution can play, you have the plurality within a larger
2518440	2525240	framework that is being defined through, in this case, the constitution. So, there is also
2525960	2535080	a form of, let's say, unity as well, created through the constitution itself as a certain
2535080	2544120	type of framework. So, what would you say, what's this relationship between the difference and the
2545000	2552200	sameness? And also, what can the role of the constitution be
2553240	2560680	in an ideal case? What can it do for the people? Yeah, there are different levels of solutions.
2560680	2570120	There is a communitarian solution. There are, for instance, participation of the social movement,
2572120	2581160	or the decision of women inside the social movement is one part of the solution.
2581960	2593560	And the state is an instrument, is a structure of power. But if that structure of power
2594280	2600440	doesn't recognize the rights of community, the right of women, the right of indigenous,
2600440	2605400	the right of the nature, that structure is a colonial structure.
2605400	2615560	And by the origin, the state was a colonial structure, but it's an instrument that all of the
2615560	2625880	country has today. We can't be autonomous. For instance, indigenous people, we claim for our
2625880	2633320	autonomy and self-determination in order to take our own decision. But the state, the state is
2634200	2645640	but the state is there. And the state is taking decision in using without us, without us today.
2646520	2654600	So, we need to be part of that, to be part of that decision inside the state.
2655160	2664680	But using our way of thinking, that will be an interchange between culture, I think. On the
2664680	2675240	contrary, all of the decisions that states take come from just from the white and the progress
2675320	2682600	and the progress philosophy or colonial philosophy. We need to contribute it.
2685640	2695480	That is the top level as the society was the design of society. The way of society is very
2696040	2703320	hierarchical way of thinking. That's hierarchy. The state is in the top.
2703480	2713800	But if the state respects our autonomy and self-determination, we can keep our
2713800	2723320	communitarian way of life. But the state had need to recognize it. On the contrary, the law persecuted
2723320	2732200	us. That's happening in our history. We were persecuted by the law of the state. When we
2733400	2743880	create our flag, we have a very beautiful Mapuche flag we created in 1992. And the state
2743880	2752840	persecuted us because we take the decision to have our own flag. What happened? And that was
2753720	2760840	because the state didn't recognize that the indigenous people have the decision
2760840	2768040	to have their own flag. Because the Chilean state didn't recognize that we are a nation.
2768840	2774520	We are not a state. We are a nation. And one state can have a different nation inside.
2780200	2789720	We apply for that solution to one state with different nation. And their experience in Europe
2791080	2799080	they are experienced in America. The state have different nation inside and recognize
2799080	2806200	the right of those nations. So we have plural state. We have multilingualism inside the state.
2808040	2813640	We also have juridical pluralism inside the state in North America, for instance.
2814440	2824360	Because there are people that are looking for the solution. And we can all go to find the solution.
2826360	2837080	That is, we just need to know what is going on in different parts of the world and to be responsible.
2837080	2843400	And to be responsible. All of us, we need to be responsible about nature. All of us
2844680	2854120	need to be responsible with cultural diversity, with multilingualism. We need it, you know?
2855080	2866840	So we need to talk about decolonize our way of thinking and the pluralism
2867880	2877000	right for nature, women's rights. All of those topics belong to decolonize, help us to decolonize
2877000	2888040	our way of thinking in order to have a new society, to have equal rights inside the difference.
2888920	2895960	Great. While you were talking, I was already reflecting that the word that I used
2896840	2902120	on the one side having plurality and on the other unity, that actually the word unity is the wrong
2902120	2908600	one, I would say, because I encounter these kinds of discourses also, for example, in the field of
2908600	2915640	there's a form of anarchist constitutionalism, and they have to deal with similar topics,
2915640	2924200	also with questions of plural forms of jurisdictions within a larger organizational form,
2924200	2931560	so to speak. And I have to correct myself in so far as it is not really about then creating a
2932280	2944040	meta unity. That's not the goal. It's to find a framework that works with the plurality
2945000	2956680	within it and can allow these different forms of approaches without bursting while doing so.
2957880	2963320	But I just wanted to note that I have to correct myself in terms of this word of unity,
2963320	2971960	because that's actually not the goal. It can have these parallel approaches without trying
2971960	2977800	to approach a higher level of unity, so to speak. So I just wanted to...
2977800	2992040	Yeah. One important thing to understand what I'm talking about is because I speak about the
2992040	3005960	diversity, about plurality, and our struggle is to have a society, a plural society, plural
3007240	3014920	way of life, different languages, different cultures, because inside the plurality,
3015720	3034920	inside the diversity, there are the richness of our humanity. So to force unity in one way,
3034920	3042040	as the European did, with unity connected with the progress.
3044760	3048520	That means the genocide for indigenous people.
3048520	3051320	Well, you know,
3051320	3074200	a very authoritarian way to think about the unity in one historical line.
3081880	3085800	Project develop European people
3088120	3096680	in one historical line, because they consider us, all of the Latin America,
3097640	3106760	means developed country that in the future will have the development, you know? Also international
3107480	3114680	institution speak about us like underdeveloped country.
3117240	3123240	They suppose that all of the policy that they did will help us for the development.
3124440	3126760	And what is the development? The progress.
3127480	3136200	But there was just one line of way of thinking. We were primitive, then we will be the Marxism,
3136840	3144760	said that we were first, we were primitive communism, you know, feudal society, then
3144920	3152200	feudal society, then capitalism, then the socialist, then we will have a
3157320	3163400	a common society without class. But in one line, in one progressive line,
3163960	3169160	in just one way of thinking, you know, and they implanted in everywhere.
3170120	3180120	Capitalism did the same. And state, neoliberal state today are doing the same. So this is,
3181960	3191560	this is why it's a part of our struggle to incide inside the state, to pluralize the state.
3191560	3198040	But it's not all of our struggle, because we need our communitarian way. We need to
3198840	3204920	keep our language. We need to recover our philosophy. We need to use our traditional dress.
3204920	3211880	We need to, to recover traditional knowledge about how to cook food, for instance.
3213560	3220680	What society today is wasting a lot of food on poor country.
3222040	3226760	There are children that they don't have food. The same happened with growth.
3228920	3237880	In Chile, we have a very beautiful desert at the north part of Chile. And the
3240520	3254360	company used our desert for clothes, old clothes. That's a pollution for our desert.
3254840	3267800	So this is why we need to pluralize our way of thinking, because just one way to consider
3267800	3274040	the society and the history destroyed our humanity.
3275080	3281880	Yeah. And I think I'll have to add that why I initially used the word unity, which is the,
3282280	3289000	which was the wrong choice. But what I wanted to initially actually point at is that,
3290600	3298040	that's why I find this notion of a constitution so interesting. And that you were the president of
3298040	3308520	this process, actually, because the very notion of a constitution can be such a tool to organize
3309480	3315800	this plurality. So that's at least from the contexts that I come from. For example,
3315800	3323240	I did interviews with Daniel Leuk, who's a person who works very much in the tradition of anarchism
3323240	3331960	and also looks closely at topics of how juridismus, juridism, I would say, maybe in English,
3332520	3340680	how this can be thought in very different ways without the coercive state, without the violence
3340680	3349000	of the state and stuff like that. And there are ways to approach these questions of, let's say,
3349880	3357880	societal-wide organization and regulation of plurality in this case. There are ways to address
3357880	3365480	this. And one of them, one way or an important tool might be the tool of constitution. And that's
3365480	3373480	why I think it's such an important and interesting combination that you are so heavily involved in
3373480	3381400	these both fields, like the insistence on plurality and the struggle for a different form of
3381400	3387800	constitution, because these two things fit together quite interestingly, I think, and not
3387800	3397080	only in terms of a defense against the state, because you can also think constitutionalism
3397080	3402920	without state at all. And that's like the next evolvement.
3402920	3414360	Yeah, you know, Aboriginal people, we had our own constitution, and it is oral. We learned about it
3414360	3422440	by oral tradition, because one constitution is a framework that organizes one society.
3423400	3434360	And all of the society, including Indigenous, we have our rules to organize our society
3435080	3442600	and to understand life, rights, our rights, and non-human rights.
3442600	3452680	So, but the modern society that is along the world have the state, and it's a reality. The state
3452680	3461240	is one reality. We need to change. Five centuries of colonialism,
3461400	3471000	the state is one reality. We need to change. Five centuries of colonialism.
3473960	3484280	And we had the state today making change inside of our children, for instance, by school.
3484680	3499320	Our children received the white history, not our history. White language, not our language.
3499560	3511960	Who did that? And who is doing that? The state law. This is why we need to change and modify
3511960	3522280	the inside, but it's not the last of our history, because we need to recover our spirituality.
3522440	3529560	We need to recover our mother's hair. We don't know the future today,
3531400	3540200	but we are suffering because what the monoculture and monolingual state and colonial state is doing
3540200	3550200	with our people. Maybe it's a transitory state, but we are suffering because we don't know the
3550520	3553080	future. Maybe it's a transitory solution,
3555640	3563400	because if you put the diversity inside the law, that will change the school.
3564840	3571480	If you put the language inside the law, we will have the right to listen to the news
3572440	3580680	on television, in our language, for instance. And that will modify. When I was the first president
3580680	3588600	of the constitutional process here in Chile, I was speaking mother tongue. And there are a lot
3588600	3595800	of people that never listened to Aboriginal language. For the first time, they listened
3595800	3604120	to the news on television, by the media, by TV. And that will make an impact, a social impact.
3605640	3613400	And we need those impacts to see we are here, we are alive, because a monocultural,
3613400	3621160	a monolingual state is denying us. And maybe you have a very strong anarchist movement inside,
3621160	3632040	or indigenous movement, but we just see ourselves in that movement. But what happened with all of
3632040	3639800	the society that are thinking that we are Barbaro, that we are not, for instance, here in Chile,
3639800	3650120	they said that we are a violent people, terrorism. So we need to make
3651320	3657560	to have the possibility to share with all of the society, because we are not isolated.
3658440	3661480	And we need to share in the majority of the mentality.
3663160	3667000	And we are here, we are the 10% of the Chilean society.
3668760	3677720	And when the first referendum about the constitution, 38% give the votes for the
3677720	3688200	plurality. But what happened with the other? We need to make change inside the mentality of
3688200	3695480	the majority of the people. And how can we do that? We need the institution, because the
3697480	3706040	system, political system use the institution in order to modify the conscience of the people.
3707000	3716360	Today they are not killing directly us, as the conqueror did long time ago.
3719240	3731800	But they are killing us using the institution, church, using media, school, military forces,
3732760	3742600	cinema, using all of those institutions to support one way of thinking.
3744360	3750520	So we need to make the plurality inside all of those institutions.
3751240	3757080	Elisa, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests. And this question is,
3757080	3760200	if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
3762520	3769720	Yeah, the future must be diverse.
3772520	3784040	The future, I really appreciate the pluralism inside person. We need to be a plural person.
3784440	3796600	One language is not enough. So that is very important for the education today. We need to
3796600	3804600	recover the right for nature. Free lakes, for instance, free river, without pollution,
3804840	3814840	without pollution, without intervention. So also the women's rights,
3816200	3825880	because we are able to take our own decision. Why the man have to take the decision for us?
3826360	3836440	It's the same question in indigenous matters, because why white people have to take the decision
3836440	3850440	for us? We are not children. We are nations. So the future must be better without racism,
3851400	3863320	without colonialism. And we'll be better respecting mother earth as our mothers.
3865080	3869800	In my culture, we pray for the nature. We say thanks to the nature.
3869960	3880840	And I believe that if more people do and feel that
3884200	3891480	the mother nation will recognize us, all of us as their children or their
3891480	3903320	sons. So with different values. Society with different values that keep the life for us
3904120	3913960	and for the diversity, cultural diversity, biological diversity, and also with the
3914600	3922440	women decision inside the world. Because we have war today.
3924680	3934200	And women, we always keep, we take care, we know how to take care of other people.
3934280	3948200	And when one president, one country does the war, they don't think about children,
3948200	3955640	they don't think about elders, they don't think about the other. Maybe a woman
3955800	3964920	can think about other, but with other values. I'm not thinking now in Margaret Thatcher,
3966360	3975320	because he had a patriarchal way of thinking. We need to stop the patriarchalism too.
