00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,160
Sören Mao in today's episode.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,720
Sören is a communist philosopher and author of the brilliant book Mute Compulsion, a Marxist

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,440
Theory of the Economic Power of Capital, which I enjoyed reading a lot.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,960
And by the way, it's also available in German under the title Stummerzwang, eine Marxistische

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,280
Analyse der ökonomischen Macht im Kapitalismus, published by the great Karl Dietz Verlag.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,440
So go and get it.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,860
More recently, an essay by Sören titled Communism as Freedom has been translated from Danish

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,280
in multiple languages actually, so it's available in English as well.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,040
Both of these works, the book as well as the essay, are relevant for the conversation you're

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,600
about to hear.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,480
Before we start, I'd like to thank Lukas, Fabian and Wilfried for their kind donations

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,200
and welcome Markus, Daniel and Jakob as patrons of Future Histories.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,800
Thank you so much.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,520
And then some quick social media news.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,720
You can now follow Future Histories on Blue Sky as well, so go and follow, I guess.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,840
And since I never mentioned it before on the podcast on air, there's also a Future Histories

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,880
newsletter you can subscribe to.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,240
So you might do that as well.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:36,680
But now please enjoy today's episode with Sören Mao on planning and freedom.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,300
Welcome Sören.

22
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Thank you.

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,680
And thank you so much for inviting me.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Sören, I'm absolutely convinced that freedom and security are two crucial pillars that

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,820
must be positively occupied when constructing alternative political imaginaries.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,960
So I was extremely happy to see you make such a strong and very clear-minded case for

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,280
why communism is freedom.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,160
Could you explain to us why communism is freedom and why security is part of the package as

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
well?

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,440
Well, I think that for me, freedom is kind of like the guiding principle for thinking

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,720
about how to organize a communist society.

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,440
And maybe the reason for that is that, or it has to do with what I think the problem

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,480
with capitalism is.

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,920
I wouldn't emphasize, first of all, that it's an unjust system of exploitation or that it's

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,160
alienating, for example.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,560
But I would argue that the most important reason why, or the thing that's first of

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,000
all wrong with capitalism is that it implies domination, that it's an enemy of freedom,

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,960
that capitalism is an economic system that prohibits people from living the life they

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,160
want to live.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,120
And that's what I write about in my book, Mute Compulsion, that capitalism is a system

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
of domination.

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,120
So it kind of follows from that critique of capitalism that we should think of an alternative

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,200
to capitalism as a way of avoiding domination, as creating a society with the highest possible

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,280
degree of freedom.

45
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,160
So that's how I think about what communism should be.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,200
So that's my guiding principle to think of a society with the highest degree of freedom.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,720
So in that sense, I think freedom is the first and most important principle maybe of communism.

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,680
And how does this relate to the question of security?

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:43,240
Well, I think security is a condition for exercising freedom that we want to be able

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,400
to exercise in a communist society.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,840
So in that sense, it's also a presupposition or it's a fundamental thing about communism

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
also.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:04,240
In the sense that only on the basis of existential security and an absence of fear of not being

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
able to sustain oneself, freedom can develop.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,800
That's kind of the reason I know.

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,360
One of the primary aims of a communist society would be to secure unconditional access to

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,720
everything that people need to live a good and stable and healthy life.

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,560
And just as an additional follow up in terms of the definition of freedom.

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,720
So the way that you described it before, it was very much related to an absence of domination.

60
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Are there other aspects of freedom that you would stress when it comes to this huge and

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,040
fundamental question of what this actually means?

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Freedom?

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Yes.

64
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,120
Well, I like the definition of freedom as absence of domination, but I would also and

65
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,040
I think this is maybe just another way of saying that actually that freedom is intrinsically

66
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:11,880
connected to democracy or is a democratic idea in the sense that human beings are by

67
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:19,240
nature social beings and human beings are also natural beings, a part of nature and

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,120
are dependent on the earth and the earth belongs to no one and therefore to everyone.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,120
And that means in a sense that we are by nature political animals and that the question of

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,960
how human beings relate to their conditions of existence is necessarily a political question.

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
And because of that, I think that freedom is not just a question of the relationship

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,480
between the individual and the political community or political institutions.

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,520
And that would be like the modern or liberal notion of political freedom, that freedom

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,440
is a question of the absence of political institutions from the point of view of the

75
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
individual.

76
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Freedom also has to consist in being able to participate in making decisions about

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,360
the necessarily common aspects of our lives.

78
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,640
And in that sense, I think freedom is inherently a democratic ideal.

79
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,560
And since you mentioned this logic that you apply when it comes to the question of human

80
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,280
nature or humans relation to nature, I think it would also be maybe a useful aspect to

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,680
point out that when it comes to this idea of freedom, as far as I understand your idea

82
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,760
of it, it does not entail a certain naturalized idea of that there was a human subject as

83
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,280
an essence that should be kind of brought into full fruition, so to speak.

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,920
At least that's how I understood it, that you are opposed to this notion of a naturalized

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,160
kind of free individual that is suppressed by the conditions that surround them.

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,800
Yes, that's right.

87
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,560
So one way of putting it would be to say that there is no natural in the sense of an immediately

88
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,320
given way for human beings to relate to their conditions of existence.

89
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,760
It's always a political question.

90
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,420
So it's up to us.

91
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:24,200
So communism is not an exercise in trying to discover the authentic natural ways for

92
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,080
human beings to relate to their conditions of existence.

93
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:36,440
But communism means establishing the political conditions for actually making decisions

94
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:44,240
about how we want to relate to our collective conditions of existence.

95
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
And there's no natural way of doing that.

96
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,000
It's always a political decision.

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,760
And there's no subject that should be liberated beneath that, right?

98
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Exactly.

99
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Okay.

100
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,480
So we will get to the point where we kind of dive a little bit deeper into the way you

101
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,440
imagine the set up for how communism might bring all of these things about.

102
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,660
But before we do so, I would first like to address a different layer of abstraction,

103
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,120
so to speak, which I believe to be of great importance for the way in which we think

104
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
about alternatives.

105
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,060
In your book, Mute Compulsion, you argue that Marx's critique is not aiming to provide

106
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,940
an alternative political economy, but that he instead criticizes the field of political

107
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:40,020
economy as such and the implicit assumptions and concepts that are baked into it, so to

108
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
speak.

109
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,580
So what are the elements and functional logics of the field of political economy that Marx

110
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,100
criticized and what does this critique mean for the way in which we think about alternatives

111
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,380
to capitalism today?

112
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,900
I think that probably the most fundamental gesture in Marx's critique of political economy

113
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,820
is to historicize.

114
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:10,500
So the problem with the field of political economy is, first of all, it's a historical

115
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,980
way of thinking about capitalism or about the economy.

116
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,460
So I think that's the most important shift of perspective in Marx's critique of political

117
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:25,180
economy and his critique of capitalism, to view the capitalist economy as a historical

118
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,660
reality, as something that came into being at a certain point in history for certain

119
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,520
historical reasons that we need to uncover and explain.

120
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,960
So another way of saying that is to say that the problem with political economy is its

121
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:53,360
economism, its tendency to, and that's something that you also find in mainstream economics

122
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:01,520
today and also, I would say, much political science, the often implicit idea that the

123
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:09,240
economy is a separated sphere of society governed by its own distinct forms of rationality.

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,360
I think Robert Brenner puts it very well, he writes somewhere that historical materialist

125
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:22,380
accounts of capitalism begin by denying the existence of a transhistorical economic rationality.

126
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:32,940
So the idea is to politicize the economy, to see the economy as consisting of social

127
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:41,340
relations, historically specific social relations, and therefore as a political reality, and

128
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:49,560
that means rejecting the conceptual separation between politics and economics, the political

129
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,640
and the economic.

130
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,260
So that's obviously also important for how we think about alternatives to capitalism,

131
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:06,820
because that means that there are no transhistorical economic laws, there is no such thing as

132
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,080
transhistorical economic rationality.

133
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,520
It's up to us to decide how the economy should be organized, that means it's up to us to

134
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,940
decide what should be produced and who should produce it and how it should be produced

135
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,300
and who should get the results of that production and so on.

136
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,980
All of these economic processes, all of these economic decisions are always necessarily

137
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,500
political decisions.

138
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:43,300
So I think that's maybe the most fundamental idea in Marx's critique of political economy.

139
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,880
Okay, let's maybe dig a little deeper into that.

140
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,920
So in your article you write that it's not, when it comes to the question of alternatives,

141
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,680
you write that following from that it's not about providing an alternative economic principle,

142
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,700
but that it's instead, and I quote, you hear about enabling democratic decision making

143
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,900
about how our shared activities and resources should be organized.

144
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,700
And I think you already mentioned some aspects that are kind of related to this question

145
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,620
when it comes to how to avoid, let's say, the mistakes of economists, so to speak.

146
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,660
But I would be interested to take a second look into this.

147
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,720
Would you say that we should kind of ditch economics altogether?

148
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,180
You stated that you need to historicize it, there are no transhistorical laws of economics,

149
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,260
so to speak.

150
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,460
But are there, let's say, some aspects maybe of the theoretical apparatus of political

151
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:53,580
economy or maybe a bit more narrowly economics that can sensibly be repurposed for a constructive

152
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:00,960
effort around alternatives, or would you argue that we should kind of ditch the discipline

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,800
of economics altogether?

154
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,560
That would be one part of my question and the other one would be, and this is a very

155
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,960
crucial aspect to me, in neoliberalism, the market constitutes also a site for the production

156
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,340
of truth.

157
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:23,440
So if we argue for overcoming the market in this function as well, I'm asking myself,

158
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:32,360
what could be the mechanisms, maybe in plural, to fulfill this aspect of societal organization?

159
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Because this is a very, very crucial mechanism, I would say, within the way our societies

160
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:46,840
are governed today, and I get the sense that simply stating we will do it democratically

161
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,640
then does not kind of answer the questions sufficiently, I would say, because these

162
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:59,200
things operate on different levels, I would say.

163
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,680
To be honest, I'm not sure I understand why saying we will do that democratically

164
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:12,280
is not a good answer, because I think that the way the function of the market in capitalism

165
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:21,760
as one of the functions of the market in a capitalist society is coordinating production,

166
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,080
coordinating decisions of individual producing units about how much to produce and how to

167
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,120
produce things, by what productivity standards and so on.

168
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,240
That's one of the things that price signals does, and that would be replaced by planning.

169
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,000
So we would take, in a communist society, we would make democratic decisions about

170
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,840
what are we going to produce, and we would also be able, for example, to take democratic

171
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,480
decisions about production methods and productivity standards, for example.

172
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,760
So in that sense, I think my answer would simply be that we are going to replace the

173
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,200
market and market mechanisms with democratic decision processes.

174
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:20,400
And I'm not sure why that's not a good answer.

175
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,800
It's an absolutely great answer in general, I would say, but since I conducted quite

176
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,320
a couple of interviews on democratic planning by now with different people who develop different

177
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,080
models surrounding that, I more and more got the sense that at some point, when it comes

178
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,080
to crucial questions within these models, this is the default answer, which is kind

179
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,280
of serving as a cover-up in many ways.

180
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,560
And it's serving as a cover-up, for example, when it comes to questions of valuation

181
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:01,720
or evaluation, like measure, what's the way in which we kind of agree to measure, let's

182
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
say?

183
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,680
What do we agree on what the basis of our decision-making and evaluation is, so to speak?

184
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
So that's one element.

185
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,800
And the other one is that in some of the instances, there's a certain, for me, problematic

186
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,360
fallback to a certain notion of the subject, because then if you go further, you know,

187
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,400
we do it democratically, okay, fine, that's great.

188
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,880
And then what's the basis of this democratic process?

189
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,320
And then you get to the question of the subject.

190
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,560
And then in many instances, you have a kind of weird notion of the underlying subject,

191
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,280
I would say, which is conceptualized as an autonomous, self-activating and self-governing

192
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:51,280
subject, to quote Pat Devine, who otherwise has a very, very, very great model or idea

193
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,560
of how to approach democratic planning.

194
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:01,720
But there you get to some kind of, it gets more complicated than just stating, okay,

195
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,760
we do it democratic and then it's fine, I would say, because there are certain questions

196
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,600
that are attached to it that still need to be answered or that might complicate the

197
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,960
whole thing quite a bit, I would say.

198
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,720
But in general, it's of course right to say so.

199
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,680
If we just state it very generally, then yes, absolutely, let's do democratic planning,

200
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,680
of course.

201
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:34,480
You're right that there are a lot of complicating factors here and it's obviously an extremely

202
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,720
important question you raise about how we evaluate and how we measure and are we going

203
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,760
to measure in hours and labor time, for example?

204
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,200
Some people would say no, I don't really see a problem with doing that.

205
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:01,240
But it's obviously extremely difficult, I think, to come up with a very clear answer

206
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,360
to how we decide on productivity standards, for example.

207
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,520
So if we democratically decide that we want to produce a certain amount of a certain

208
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,440
product and then we need to know how much time does it take to produce that.

209
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,560
And in order to make that calculation, we need a productivity standard.

210
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,480
And how do we decide on that?

211
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,680
Should it be the producers, for example, the people who are actually producing the product

212
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,360
that should decide that, decide how they want to work?

213
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:44,720
Or do we want to accept some kind of that they have to do it within certain limits,

214
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:53,960
that the broader society as such can demand a certain productivity standard from the producers?

215
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:01,760
But no matter how we answer those questions, I think it always comes back to that the

216
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,680
only legitimate way of doing that in a communist society would be to do some sort of

217
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,920
democratic decision making process.

218
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,440
So that's a difficult question, but it's a question we would have to find some sort

219
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:26,640
of answer to, because the alternative would be to accept the blind forces of the blind

220
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,320
domination of the market or something like that, or a despotic authority of some sort.

221
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Right, right.

222
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,160
No, no, neither of those, for sure.

223
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,480
But maybe just to get an idea about the first part of the question.

224
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,920
How much of the corpus of political economy and economics specifically can be repurposed

225
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,840
in a sensible way for this constructive effort?

226
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,520
Because I mean, somehow one gets the sense that it's built on rotten ground.

227
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,080
But I mean, it is also there might still be something that can be useful.

228
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,240
So I would be interested in your opinion on that.

229
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,760
I'm not totally sure what to answer to this question.

230
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm tempted to say that there's not much of worth keeping in economics, but I think

231
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:33,440
that a planned economy would require a lot of data gathering, data collecting, collecting

232
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,400
and managing data and also a lot of calculation.

233
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,520
And it might be that there are some aspects of economics that would be useful in order

234
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,240
to do that calculation and handling of data, but I'm not sure.

235
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:00,640
Okay, so let's kind of leave this very abstract level and get to a bit more concrete levels

236
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
of the discussion.

237
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,360
Your article describes some of the basic coordinates of how to organize our societies differently

238
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,960
in communism in order to provide freedom, security and much, much more.

239
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,480
Could you maybe run us through the basic coordinates of how you imagine communism to be organized?

240
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:34,400
Yes, that's a big question, but I guess the basic idea is that communism requires replacing

241
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:44,280
the market with planning and to create new political institutions that would enable

242
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,560
us to make democratic decisions about what to do with our common resources and to make

243
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,040
decisions about, economic decisions about what to produce and how to produce it and

244
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,720
where and when and how to distribute the results of that production.

245
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,560
And that's, I think, the basic coordinates, if that's what you mean.

246
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:17,240
Well, maybe, I mean, there would be the need for some types of institutions, for example.

247
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,000
So could you maybe go into that?

248
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Like what kind of institutions would we need?

249
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,360
How would they need to be different from the institutions we have?

250
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,320
So maybe you could give us a sketch of this institutional setup.

251
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,360
Yes, I think that in order to secure the highest possible degree of freedom and security

252
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,960
and in order to avoid concentration of power as much as possible, it would be useful to

253
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:52,240
try to make decisions as close as possible to those who are affected by those decisions.

254
00:22:52,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I think that would be an important guiding principle for creating a network of institutions

255
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,600
that would allow us to plan production.

256
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:15,120
So power should be decentralised as much as possible.

257
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,600
But of course, there are certain decisions that cannot be left to individuals or to

258
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,360
small local groups or something like that, especially here, I'm especially thinking

259
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,000
of decisions regarding use of natural resources.

260
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,040
So we're obviously also going to need some sort of actually a global institution for

261
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,560
making decisions about that.

262
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:56,800
But so I'm imagining communist political institutions as a network of several layers of

263
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:05,480
institutions that make decisions and where there's not a clear hierarchy of institutions

264
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,160
in the way that we're used to from the nation state as we know it.

265
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:20,080
So I think that if we use the word state to talk about what we know as the modern nation

266
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:31,080
state, then we would have to abolish the state and design and construct new political

267
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
institutions.

268
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,240
If we use a broader notion of the state as basically any kind of political institution,

269
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:47,280
then I would say that we need to come up with a new form of state, a new state power.

270
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,800
But that's not really an answer to your question, is it?

271
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,920
Well, that's totally fine.

272
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,320
If you do not have this sketch of which kinds of institutions specifically would be needed

273
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,280
and which kinds of tasks they would be able and necessary to perform, that's totally

274
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,720
all right.

275
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,280
I think it would be nonetheless good to kind of paint a little bit more of a picture of

276
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:18,560
how you imagine this general set up to be, because there are some other aspects that

277
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,600
you do define in your text.

278
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,320
You write about communes.

279
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:31,320
You write about that these communes should be ideally autark, more or less, even though,

280
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,680
as you pointed towards in your last answer as well, even though there is the need for

281
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,160
kind of higher level coordination as well.

282
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,160
But you, at least in the text state, that you think this would be an ideal structure

283
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,560
to have these communes to be more or less autark.

284
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,560
You also write about a certain amount of work that people should perform.

285
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,000
And I'm absolutely curious about getting to know whether or not this implies some form

286
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,440
of compulsion to work, which is kind of implied, but not really made explicit.

287
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,160
So there are other aspects to the way that you imagine this communist society to be

288
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,520
organized that you do have ideas about.

289
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,680
So maybe we could kind of get into those aspects as well.

290
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:29,760
Yes, yeah, I use the word commune as a way of talking about what would be the basic

291
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,120
institutional unit of communism.

292
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,800
And ideally, every commune would have control over everything that the commune needs in

293
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:51,240
order to secure a good and stable life for its communards, for the people who live in

294
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,360
that commune. And the reason why I think that's an important principle is that it would

295
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:05,720
make us less vulnerable to counterrevolutionary attempts to re-erect class society, for

296
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:14,200
example, or other forms of also forms of concentration of power or corruption, something

297
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,000
like that. If communes are not too dependent upon each other, then they would have

298
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,040
more autonomy. And that means that if if something went wrong in one commune, it wouldn't

299
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:34,760
necessarily the other communes would have a better basis for struggling against that or

300
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:43,040
trying to avoid a concentration of power or corruption or counterrevolutionary

301
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
movements and so on.

302
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:55,760
Yet at the same time, you, I think, rightfully stress that there is actually by nature, you

303
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,320
argue, a high level of interdependence.

304
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,840
You know, and I when reading about this autarky aspect of the commune, even though I

305
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,160
understand your argument as well, that it creates some kind of safety backup, so to

306
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,840
speak, when it comes to attacks and stuff like that.

307
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,600
But still, I was kind of a bit irritated about this falling back into this very strong

308
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:32,960
notion of autonomy, because, as I said, really like the approach of emphasizing the

309
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,240
interdependence. And this interdependence is also highly relevant when it comes to, like

310
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,200
many, many of the aspects that will have to be addressed through each and every commune

311
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,200
as well. You already talked about the question of resource use.

312
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:59,800
I mean, if we do want to have some kind of meta level coordination when it comes to

313
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,280
this question of resource use, which is kind of necessary if we want to, for example,

314
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:12,280
address climate change and excessive resource use as it is being performed right now, then

315
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,440
you immediately get into a situation where you will have to have functioning forms of

316
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,160
mediation between these different levels, so to speak.

317
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:32,640
So and there I would say I would argue this idea of autarky kind of goes against this

318
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,920
grain, because the level in which this interdependence and therefore

319
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,720
interconnection will have to be enacted is so much ingrained in each and every aspect

320
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,400
of, for example, the production process, that it's very hard to imagine both of these

321
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,880
same things at the same time, you know, this high, very high level of autonomy for each

322
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,800
commune and kind of organizational coordination on a meta level when it comes to, for

323
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,720
example, overall resource use, because these things are necessarily intertwined in a very,

324
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,920
very intense way.

325
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:19,560
So I was kind of struggling to imagine how highly autarky communes working next to each

326
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:26,440
other, so to speak, but not really together as a default modus operandi, so to speak,

327
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:34,040
how these autonomous communes would be able to to achieve this higher level coordination.

328
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,640
I think that regarding the question of interdependence, I think that there's a

329
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,000
fundamental difference between human individuals and political communities.

330
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,360
I think humans are necessarily by nature social animals that are highly dependent upon

331
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:01,680
each other. So the interdependence I speak about is the interdependence between human

332
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,200
individuals, which is which is one of the reasons why, as I tried to explain earlier,

333
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,120
that that's one of the reasons why human freedom must necessarily also consist in

334
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:24,920
being able to participate in democratic political decision making processes.

335
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,200
But the same point, that point about interdependence is not necessarily true of

336
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,360
political communities, I would say of communities of human beings.

337
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,400
Political communities are not necessarily dependent upon each other to the same degree.

338
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:48,280
We are dependent on each other in the way that all political communities would live on

339
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,520
the same planet and we would have to share that planet.

340
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,880
And because of that, it would be necessary to have some sort of global regulation of the

341
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,520
use of natural resources, for example, how it could, for example, take the form of

342
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:09,200
quotas for CO2 quotas or something like that on a global level for each commune.

343
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,360
And then each commune would decide how they would use that or all sorts of different

344
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,160
quotas for the use of natural resources.

345
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,280
And then it would be up to each commune to decide how to use that.

346
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,560
So there is certainly an interdependence there that means that some sort of cooperation

347
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,400
between communes would be necessary.

348
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:45,160
But I think it would be a good idea to not to have a too high degree of division of labor

349
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,160
between communes, for example, because interdependence and division of labor would

350
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,160
always be a risk, because if one commune is dependent on something that another

351
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,440
commune produces, then a power relationship of domination can easily arise.

352
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:15,400
So in order to secure freedom and in order to counteract tendencies to inequality

353
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,600
between communes and relationships of domination between communes, it would be important to

354
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,360
maintain a high degree of autonomy, I would say.

355
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,520
Because imagine, for example, that the commune you live in has decided not to produce

356
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,280
medicine, for example, because there's a neighbor commune that produces a lot of

357
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,240
medicine instead.

358
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,520
And there's a division of labor where you and then you exchange or whatever you produce

359
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,880
something else that that other commune needs.

360
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,480
But then if there's something like a counterrevolutionary political force or movement

361
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,360
in that other commune where all of the medicine you need in your commune is produced, then all

362
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:11,800
of a sudden you would have to accept what they do or accept their demands or subject

363
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,680
yourself to that.

364
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:20,440
So you would be vulnerable in that sense if the commune you lived in don't have the

365
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,240
resources to produce medicine for themselves, for example.

366
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,920
How big of a commune do you imagine?

367
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,920
So if you talk about communes as the smallest organizational unit, how big are these

368
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,040
communes you think about?

369
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,200
That's a really good question.

370
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,360
And I think that communes could vary very much in size.

371
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,880
I think one thing that's important to note here is that we would have to build

372
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,560
communism on the basis of whatever capitalism has left us with, which means, for example,

373
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,360
that we would have to build communism also in enormous urban areas with 20 million

374
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,400
people, for example.

375
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:12,360
So I would imagine, for example, that we would break up cities like Tokyo or Shanghai

376
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,640
or New York into several communes.

377
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,040
And one of the problems with an urban commune would be that it would be unable to produce

378
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,080
its own food.

379
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,560
So it would be a good idea, for example, to have communes that would extend from an urban

380
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:39,880
area into a rural area in order to be able to produce everything the commune needs.

381
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:50,840
But I imagine that communes in heavily urbanized areas would maybe have up to one or two

382
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,640
million inhabitants or communists.

383
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,840
But I also imagine that in other places, in very desolate areas with very few people,

384
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:11,800
we could have quite large, in terms of area, large communes with maybe only 50,000

385
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
inhabitants or something like that.

386
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:23,000
And there are so many different reasons why to draw the borders between communes.

387
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,960
It could also be, for example, natural, like the landscape, the landscape could also be

388
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,120
reasons for drawing borders between communes, mountains or rivers or things like that.

389
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:46,840
So I think that we would, that the communes could very, very much incise from, for example,

390
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:58,040
maybe from a few thousand people to millions of people.

391
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,880
I think we kind of then circle back to this question of interdependence again, because

392
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,960
I mean, for many things, I mean, if you want to build a computer, you will have to have

393
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:22,760
minerals, many materials, knowledge, so many things that not every like two or five

394
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,360
thousand people commune will be able to provide, obviously.

395
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:32,120
So again, we are back to this question of interdependence and kind of impossibility

396
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,400
of total autarky when it comes to many, many things, you know, infrastructural things

397
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:45,400
like train connections that span, in this case, many communes for sure, because we would

398
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,720
not want to kind of just get to the border of my commune and then have to change into

399
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,360
another form of transportation, so to speak.

400
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,920
So I mean, these are all, of course, questions that kind of pop up in this very atomized

401
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,480
way of thinking about it.

402
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:10,280
And if that would be a too big a problem, then I guess communes could decide to make

403
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:17,240
one larger commune, like to fusion, is that the word, into a larger commune.

404
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,320
Or they would maybe just accept that there are certain things that they are unable to

405
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,000
produce. And because in such a situation people would be able to move freely between

406
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,040
communes, then, you know, it would maybe also, we should maybe also think of that as a

407
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,760
situation where there would be many different kinds of communes with many different forms

408
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:45,400
of life and that maybe some people would prefer, you know, one way of living in a

409
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:52,520
rural commune where you wouldn't have to work that much, but there would also be certain

410
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,280
things that you wouldn't be able to have there.

411
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,280
But you would always be able to move to another commune if you wanted to do that.

412
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,480
Or the commune could also just, you know, it would be up to each commune to decide

413
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:18,200
how much to depend on other communes or make agreements with other communes about

414
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
exchanging things or whatever.

415
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,400
Okay, maybe let's then dig a little deeper into this, because you just now mentioned

416
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,840
exchange, so let's dig a little deeper into the planning process, because you do sketch

417
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
some ideas within your text.

418
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,240
Could you maybe run us through how you imagine a planning mechanism to go about?

419
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:49,560
Yes, well, I think the first step is that we would have to make decisions about what we're

420
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,840
going to take collective responsibility for producing.

421
00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:00,920
So, decisions about what to produce would have to be taken democratically in our political

422
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
institutions in the commune.

423
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:12,200
And then, and I imagine that that would, could, for example, take the form of different groups

424
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,760
or organizations or that could submit proposals and that there would be some sort of, you

425
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:28,920
know, public debate about that or, and then maybe several rounds of voting for those

426
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,000
different plans, which would be plans for maybe a couple of years, let's say two years,

427
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
for example.

428
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,880
So, every second year we would vote for a new plan and that plan would basically be a

429
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,840
proposal for what to take collective responsibility for producing.

430
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,880
So, what to do with our common resources.

431
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,880
And then through that political process, we would end up with a production plan and that

432
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:12,360
would then have to be implemented and that could be translated to a certain amount of

433
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:19,080
working hours, total working hours that would be distributed as a rule evenly among everyone.

434
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,480
So, that's like the way I think about that in very broad terms.

435
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,360
And would there then be a compulsion to work?

436
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,000
We touched upon this, but didn't yet answer it.

437
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:42,200
That's a good question and I think that I would love to be able to say no and that there would

438
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:51,480
never be any form of, that in communism everyone would be able to do whatever they want

439
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:59,720
all the time and that there would be no one forcing you to do anything, but I'm not sure.

440
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,240
I think that's a realistic thing to say.

441
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:14,200
So, it's a realistic scenario that some people might not live up to their duties all the time

442
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:25,240
and I think that we would then have to discuss to what degree we would accept that

443
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,400
because I could also imagine that it would also be possible just to calculate with that

444
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:41,800
in a sense that there's a certain amount of people that wouldn't show up for work or

445
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:49,400
something like that and maybe we could just accept that, but if it turns out that it has

446
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,520
too many negative consequences in the long run, I think there would probably need to be

447
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:04,840
some sort of, I'm not sure compulsion to work is the right way to describe it, but

448
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:14,440
I could imagine, for example, that you could lose certain privileges if you don't take your

449
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:21,560
share of collective responsibilities. I think that it's really important to, as I said earlier,

450
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,520
to guarantee unconditional access to everything that people need to live a

451
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:38,840
good, healthy, stable life, so unconditional access to housing and food, medicine,

452
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:47,080
healthcare and so on, but imagine, for example, that we have collectively decided that everyone

453
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:56,200
has the right to take a new education every 10 years, for example, then maybe that's a

454
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:04,680
right that you could lose or imagine that there are waiting lists for certain, especially

455
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,840
attractive housing, something like that, and then maybe if you don't show up for work,

456
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,720
then you will lose your place on the waiting list for a housing or something like that.

457
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:26,200
So there could be certain things that I'm not sure I would categorize that as or call that

458
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:35,400
compulsion to work. Does that make sense? Yeah, kind of. I mean, I think for me the thing is that

459
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,560
I would say that you end up with this dilemma, because I can sense that it's a dilemma for you

460
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:48,920
as well, somehow it feels like it. And I think you end up with this dilemma because of this

461
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,280
separation that you introduced, the separation between the realm of necessity and the realm

462
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,000
of freedom. So maybe let's talk about that, because I think this is the source for why you then come

463
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,240
to a point where you have this situation where you think that you need to discipline or incentivize,

464
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:16,280
which is kind of a form of disciplining in a different way, so to speak. That's why you end

465
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,360
up with this constellation where you think that you need to discipline people into doing certain

466
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:31,960
types of work in order to use this remuneration or withholding of remuneration or benefits in

467
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:38,760
order to steer, so to speak, the way in which things are being organized. So I think this is

468
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,240
the root of it. So maybe let's talk about it. Could you maybe describe these different realms

469
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,120
to us and why you believe this to be a sensible distinction? Well, it's a distinction

470
00:45:48,120 --> 00:46:01,240
that Marx makes, and I refer to Aaron Benenow when I mentioned it in the essay, but I'm not sure

471
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:08,360
it's the best way to describe actually what I'm trying to describe there. So the idea is that

472
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:15,080
there are certain needs that we agree politically to take collective responsibility for,

473
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:23,080
and that's the public production. That would be what the commune decides to produce,

474
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,320
what we decide together to produce in the commune, and to take responsibility for.

475
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:35,560
So that's what we could call the realm of necessity, if we want to use that notion,

476
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:46,520
because it's what we agree is necessary labor, necessary production. So it would obviously be,

477
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,480
for example, production of food for everyone, production of medicine and housing and things

478
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:01,080
like that. But there are a lot of things that would quite obviously be necessary for

479
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,760
the commune to exist, and we would have to take care of that collectively. But then there are all

480
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,400
sorts of products that we would not necessarily regard as a public responsibility to take care of.

481
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:21,240
Maybe some people would suggest that we should build a piano factory,

482
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,400
because we want to have pianos. But other people might have the opinion that, well,

483
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:35,000
I would rather work less, because everything we would decide to produce would mean more work

484
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,160
for everyone, because we would distribute work evenly. So everything we add to the list of what

485
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:49,320
the commune produces would mean more work for everyone, because we would distribute work evenly.

486
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:59,960
So it would always be a discussion about or a decision about what do we want to

487
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,880
have more, less work, or do we want to have this or that product.

488
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,240
And then we would disagree on that. So maybe some people would vote for a production plan that

489
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:17,000
would include pianos and accept that everyone would have to work a little bit more, because

490
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,600
we think it's nice to have pianos. And other people would maybe prefer not to work and then

491
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:30,360
not to have pianos. And then whatever the result would be, the commune would not necessarily

492
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:39,000
produce everything that people want. So there will be a lot of needs that will not be met,

493
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,080
or a lot of wants that will not be met by the production that is organized by the commune.

494
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:51,880
And what are we going to do about that? Well, it's obvious, I think, to say that people

495
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,360
would be, if they can, they would be free to produce that in their free time outside of the

496
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:07,800
work organized by the commune. So that's kind of like the basis for distinguishing between

497
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,400
the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom. The realm of necessity is the

498
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,560
all of the things we agree are necessary to produce together and that we take collective

499
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:29,000
responsibility for producing. And as a political community and the realm of freedom is whatever we

500
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:39,080
want to use all of us, all of the rest of our time, whatever we want to use that for. And it's

501
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,400
important here to know that the realm of freedom would be much larger in

502
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,240
counting in hours and we would have more free time.

503
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:03,400
Yeah. I want to add that I'm not sure that those terms, the realm of necessity and the realm of

504
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:09,240
freedom are the best way to describe that. And maybe that's what some of what you were

505
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,960
thinking about when you asked me about this, that I just said earlier that organizing

506
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,920
the economy by means of democratic decision making would be the best thing to do with

507
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:32,120
one society with as high a degree of freedom as possible. So in a sense that is wrong to oppose

508
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:40,840
that to freedom. Right. Absolutely. I would agree with that with the last statement. That's why

509
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,520
I think it's an unlucky separation because for me when reading the text I always thought,

510
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:53,560
what? Wait a second. What you're describing as the realm of necessity is the realm of freedom

511
00:50:53,560 --> 00:51:02,760
since it produces freedom as such. And also through this separation of realm of

512
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,400
necessity and realm of freedom, you get into a position where you kind of reproduce

513
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:16,600
a certain notion of labor, not only work, but labor, meaning that something that I do not want to do,

514
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,800
but have to do. And this has all kinds of consequences in terms of motivation, in terms of

515
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:29,560
effectiveness and stuff like that. So I would argue that one would need to approach

516
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,680
what you call the realm of necessity also from a perspective through which

517
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:42,280
what you have to do in order to reproduce is not just a kind of labor you have to do because you

518
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:51,000
are being forced to, but is also a part of a perspective that sees this work as absolutely,

519
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,600
I wanted to say logic, but that's maybe the wrong word, as a necessary part of reproduction

520
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,320
that is not separated into a kind of alienating thing to do, so to speak,

521
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:12,600
maybe to be a bit polemic about it, I would say. So I'm kind of against these different splits.

522
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:22,120
I can definitely see why you're against that. I think maybe it's good to remind ourselves

523
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:28,040
why Marx uses these words. And I think it's because when he talks about realm of necessity,

524
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:34,280
I think he's talking about a kind of natural necessity here, the fact that human beings are

525
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:43,000
forced to work if we want to live. And I think Marx is right in that one of the fundamental

526
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,120
aspects of human beings is, and he says this already in his early writings in the German

527
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,600
Ideologie, that what distinguishes human beings from other animals is that they produce,

528
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:59,080
that we are forced to transform our surroundings in order to be able to live of them. So

529
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:05,080
human beings, we have to work in order to live. We have to transform our surroundings in order

530
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:11,320
to be able to live off those surroundings. And that is a natural necessity. And that's why

531
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:19,960
he calls it the realm of necessity, right? And then the more productive we can get,

532
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:27,720
the less time we need to do that, or also depending on the natural conditions of where we live.

533
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,920
If you live in certain areas, certain places on the earth, it would require more work to

534
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,840
to be able to survive than in other places. But the basic fact is that there is a certain

535
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:47,320
amount of work that is necessary in order to live. And that's a natural necessity. And that's why

536
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:53,240
Marx calls it the realm of necessity. And in opposition to that, the rest of your time you

537
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:02,120
can use to do whatever you want. And that's the realm of freedom. So I think maybe the reason why,

538
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:10,520
or the source of confusion or disagreement here is maybe that we're maybe confusing

539
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:18,120
a natural necessity and freedom with political necessity and political freedom,

540
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,800
if that makes sense. Yeah, kind of. But also, I think the way that you use the realm of necessity

541
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,680
is not the way that you described it right now. So it's not the Marxian notion of subsistence. So

542
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,480
the basic level of what you have to do in order to reproduce yourself as a physical,

543
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:45,400
biological object, so to speak. So you use it in a very different way, which is encompassing

544
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,280
much more than just subsistence. And then, and I think this kind of complicates this as well,

545
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,920
you use these words private sector and public sector. So you use public sector for the realm

546
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,440
of necessity and then private sector for the realm of freedom, so to speak. And I mean,

547
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:13,160
this also adds another layer of confusion in that it kind of runs the danger of sounding as if you

548
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:20,360
wanted to say that the private sector, in which you also state that there will possibly still be

549
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:26,120
markets, exchange, et cetera, that this is the realm of freedom. And it quickly sounds

550
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:33,800
like this liberal talking point where markets are equated with freedom and planning is

551
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,320
basically tyranny and obligation, so to speak, which is definitely not what you wanted to state.

552
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,840
And it is absolutely clear reading the text that this is not what you wanted to say. But

553
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:51,720
I just think that this terminology, this additional terminology of public sector and

554
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,640
private sector also kind of feeds into the misunderstanding, I would say. Yeah.

555
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah, I think you're right about that. And there's obviously

556
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:10,360
a risk that, well, because public and private sector are concepts that we also use about

557
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:19,880
the capitalist economy, then there's a risk of thinking that what I'm describing

558
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,880
there would be something that's similar to how the capitalist economy works, which is

559
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:31,320
not what I'm trying to do, but not what I'm trying to say there. So I'm open to suggestions

560
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:38,280
for a better way of making this distinction, because I think it is an important distinction

561
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:45,480
to make. And so in a communist mode of production, we would make democratic decisions

562
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,440
about what to produce. But what about all the things that we would decide not to produce?

563
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:00,120
I mean, I could see myself voting for a production plan that would mean that a lot of things that

564
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,480
some people would like to have would not be produced. And what do we say to those people who

565
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:12,440
would then would like to have those products? I mean, the thing in capitalism is that Marx puts

566
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:20,520
it somewhere in capital that money is basically a technology for transforming

567
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,720
a social power into the power of the individual, something like that. He says something about

568
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,800
carrying social power in your pocket or something like that. Because what you can do in capitalism

569
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,640
is that if you have money, then you can basically decide what will happen to some of our

570
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:46,360
collective resources. Because demand on the market is what determines what gets produced,

571
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:57,560
right? And that power of the individual in capitalism, that money allows you as an

572
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:03,480
individual to decide what gets produced. You wouldn't have that in a communist society,

573
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:10,360
because that's the problem with capitalism, that it's people who have money who decide.

574
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:18,040
So we would replace that with collective democratic decision making. And that would mean

575
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,880
that there would be a lot of things that we would maybe not take collective responsibility

576
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,600
for producing. And what do we do about that? I think it's not a good answer to say, well,

577
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:34,280
people just have to accept that we're not going to produce pianos or other things that some

578
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:44,040
people would maybe think would be luxury products. And I think it's better to say that people would

579
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,040
have the possibility of producing that in their free time. And they could also find other people

580
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,160
who would also like pianos and produce pianos together and then make some kind of private

581
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:02,040
piano producing factory, if that's what they want. I mean, why shouldn't they not be able to

582
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,680
that? Why should we ban that? And of course, that would require some resources, because you need a

583
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,080
lot of things in order to build pianos. And where would you get those resources from? You would

584
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,080
obviously have to get them from the commune. So again, the commune would have to make decisions

585
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:21,400
about which resources to give to private production. But I think it's important to

586
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:29,960
acknowledge that if we are going to have a democratically planned economy, there would be a

587
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,920
lot of things that would not get produced, a lot of needs that would not be met by

588
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:41,960
our collective production. And we would have to find a way of letting people

589
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:50,360
having those needs met in other ways. So that's a way of saying that there

590
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:56,760
would be production also outside of what the commune organizes. The production organized

591
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:04,040
by the commune would not be all production that there is in society. So we need some sort of

592
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,320
distinction there. We need a concept to distinguish between those two forms of production.

593
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:15,160
Yeah, I mean, there are different questions attached to that. If you say that what you call

594
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,160
the private sector will need to get some forms of resources, I think then you'll quickly get to

595
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:29,640
the point where one might say, okay, why then not just include this as a need into the collective

596
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:38,200
process? Why funnel these resources into a market system, so to speak, in order to be able to

597
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:46,120
produce piano? So we can have mechanisms that allow for the detection of needs that are not yet

598
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:54,040
met. We can develop mechanisms that are able to provide some form of plus X that might be some

599
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,840
form of luxury goods. So there should be some mechanisms. I absolutely agree with you. There

600
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:06,120
should be some mechanisms in place that are able to kind of address these extra needs, so to speak.

601
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:12,520
I'm not quite sure whether this automatically implies that you will have to have a form of

602
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:20,600
classical market system, you know, with some form of money, some form of value form and all the

603
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:26,360
things that go along with this, because at least to me it sounded as if what you describe as a

604
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:33,640
private sector would then probably have all of these things in order to be able to produce

605
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:43,320
this plus X. And my argument would be there can be creative ways of integrating this absolutely

606
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:52,600
valid need for the plus X into forms of democratic planning as well. So it's not about a rigid system

607
01:01:52,600 --> 01:02:00,840
that does not have any ability to change, to include, to have realms of freedom within

608
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:07,320
what we consider the collective mechanism, I would argue. And also just as a note,

609
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,320
it might be interesting for you to take a look at David Leibman's model of multi-level

610
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:17,880
democratic iterative coordination, because he does have some kind of setup similar to that,

611
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:25,320
because he imagines a core sector which is run through this mechanism, the MDIC mechanism,

612
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:30,120
and then he imagines that there will be some form of kind of peripheral sector,

613
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:39,080
which will have probably some market mechanisms as well, but which might bit by bit also be

614
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:46,840
integrated over time into the MDIC system. So just as a note. But we do not have that much

615
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:54,280
time left and I have so many questions left. So I would have to pick and choose. I mean, maybe

616
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,760
before we get to the final question that I ask all of my guests, maybe let's get back to this

617
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:07,560
very high level of abstraction that you, I think, very brilliantly look at in your book Mute

618
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,800
Compulsion, because there you describe the fact that capitalism, in order to reproduce itself,

619
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:20,920
it does not only rely on ideology and violence, but also on mute compulsion or what you call

620
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:29,160
economic power. So I'm quite interested in the question, which kind of alternatives

621
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:35,400
a communism would have to provide in order to address these different fields that now

622
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:42,280
guarantee the reproduction of capitalism. So to frame it a bit more clearly, hopefully,

623
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:52,120
what kinds of mechanisms of reproduction of reproducing itself would communism need to have

624
01:03:52,120 --> 01:04:00,200
in order to produce this stability and yeah, in order to reproduce itself maybe,

625
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:08,360
because I think we could go one by one through violence, ideology and economic power and ask

626
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:16,360
ourselves, okay, now this is in capitalism, this is handled through these three powers,

627
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:21,560
so to speak, but which kinds of powers would communism need to have in order to reproduce

628
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:32,040
itself? Well, I think that there would not be something similar to violence in communism,

629
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:37,000
because I mean, capitalism relies on violence, especially the violence of the state.

630
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:47,960
Without a state that guarantees private property, for example, through the use of violence in the

631
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,280
form of police and military, capitalism would not be possible. So in capitalism we have a

632
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:59,400
situation where the economic system is dependent upon the constant use of violence or the threat

633
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:08,120
of violence for reproducing itself. That would not be necessary in a communist society, but

634
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,960
that does not mean that I don't think that there would be any form of violence in

635
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,760
communism. I think there would still be all sorts of aggression between people and we would

636
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:25,000
have to find a way to take care of that and that would probably mean also that we would have to

637
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,520
accept that the commune would be able to use violence towards individual people in order to

638
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:37,560
force them to stop doing something like beating someone else, for example.

639
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:47,800
Private relationships or violence in that way, but that is not the same as violence as an

640
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:56,280
integrated element in the economic system. There wouldn't be anything similar to that in

641
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:06,280
communism. Regarding the question of ideology, I think that's very different. Your question

642
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:17,080
reminds me of a quote by Louis Althusser in his essay about Marxism and Humanism,

643
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:26,600
which I really like. There's a passage about ideology where he speaks about what is the role

644
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:32,600
of ideology and would there be any kind of ideology in a communist society, in a classless society?

645
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,240
I think he has a very nice way of putting that, so I'm just going to read that quote

646
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:43,960
because I just found it. He writes that, and I quote, in a class society ideology is the

647
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,960
relay whereby and the element in which the relation between men and their condition of existence

648
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:57,080
is settled to the profit of the ruling class. In a classless society ideology is the relay whereby

649
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:01,400
and the element in which the relation between men and their conditions of existence is lived to the

650
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:13,400
profit of all men. So I think that ideology is in a sense, ideology is something that will always

651
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,720
exist. The thing is that ideology is, and he's using a broad notion of ideology here because

652
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,720
this implies that ideology is not necessarily always a form of domination. It can also be

653
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:32,760
a concept that merely describes how

654
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:42,040
the way we understand ourselves and our surroundings are affected by our social world

655
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:49,640
and that can also contribute to reproducing social forms that are not domination or

656
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:58,040
hierarchies or something like that. So in a class society and in capitalism ideology has the

657
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:05,640
function of reproducing class society, reproducing capitalism, but we could definitely imagine that

658
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:10,200
in a communist society there would be ideological forms that would

659
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:18,600
help reproducing a free society and avoid re-erecting class society.

660
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,040
And then there's the question of whether there would be something similar to

661
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:33,080
economic power in communism. And I think that when I talk about economic power in capitalism

662
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:39,320
it's always a form of domination. And in that sense the whole point of

663
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:45,480
abolishing capitalism and building communism is to get rid of domination. But economic power

664
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:50,440
reveals something about a unique capacity that human beings have to organize.

665
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:58,600
We can organize our material surroundings in a way that helps to reproduce certain social

666
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:05,240
relations. In capitalism those social relations are relations of domination. But it's possible to

667
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:12,760
think about how in a communist society we could organize our material surroundings in a way that

668
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:21,880
could help reproduce communism. Or we could think about how could we organize our

669
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:31,080
material conditions of existence in a way that counteracts tendencies towards domination or

670
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:38,600
concentration of power, for example. That could be, for example, as we talked about, ensuring a high

671
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:47,000
degree of local autonomy or autonomy in each commune by giving priority to that above,

672
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,720
for example, productivity and division of labor. Because a high degree of division of labor would

673
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:59,480
maybe mean higher productivity, less working hours for everyone, less work for everyone.

674
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:05,560
But it could also have the consequence that it would make society more vulnerable to power

675
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,640
concentration. So there would be a trade-off and we would have to make some

676
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:19,160
sort of decision about that. So in that sense, if we think of economic power in a broader way as

677
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:25,400
externalizing social relations in our material conditions of existence or material and social

678
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,960
surroundings, then there would be something similar to that. We could think of using that

679
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:41,720
capacity, that unique capacity of human beings to work for communist ends in communism.

680
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,280
And then, Sören, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests and it is,

681
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,000
if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

682
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,920
It makes me joyful to imagine how daily life could be under communism,

683
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,720
to imagine, to work much less and also to imagine that we could have a totally different way of

684
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:08,120
organizing the division of labor, where maybe I wouldn't just have one function or one job

685
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,880
my entire life. Maybe I could have more than one function at the same time. So one day a week I

686
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:23,320
could do one thing and then another day in the week I could do something else. And I would maybe have

687
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:29,160
the opportunity to specialize in something new after a couple of years or do that throughout

688
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:41,720
my life. And then, of course, it makes me joyful to imagine not to never have to be worried about

689
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:54,920
money and to know that I would have a secure basis of existence, that I would have a place to live

690
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:01,320
and something to eat and everything that I would need in order to have a good life without

691
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:07,960
having to worry about how the economy is developing and what will happen in the next crisis

692
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,360
and whether I will lose my job and will I be able to pay my rent and

693
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,520
stuff like that. That makes me very joyful to think about.

694
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:21,320
