0	7800	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and it is my great pleasure to welcome George Mombio in today's episode.
7800	16320	He's a prolific author, journalist and activist, and this episode came together through a collaboration with Comunia,
16320	25560	who, together with Bund Jugend, put together an edited volume on the topic of public luxury, a concept coined by George Mombio.
25800	32360	The book is called Ã–ffentlicher Luxus and it was published by the great Karl Dietz Verlag Berlin.
32360	34360	It's fantastic and you should get it.
34360	40960	If you don't need a physical copy, you'll find a link to the digital version of the full book in the show notes.
40960	48400	Big shout out to Comunia, who are doing absolutely fantastic work in the field of socialization in Germany.
48480	55920	And I am very much looking forward to the upcoming second Vergesellschaftungskonferenz, socialization conference,
55920	61760	of which Future Histories will be, as it was with the first one, an official media partner.
61760	63200	I'm very proud.
63200	65640	So more on this soon.
65640	75520	What you will also find in the show notes is a link to a workshop held by Comunia on the topic of public luxury in February in Vienna.
75520	77560	I think you can still register to this one.
77560	79960	So if you're interested in the topic, go ahead.
79960	84760	You'll find the link in the show notes and maybe we will see each other there.
84760	90560	Before we start, I would like to welcome Alexander as a patron of Future Histories.
90560	94920	And I want to thank Lukas and Samuel for their donations.
94920	101440	And now please enjoy today's episode with George Mombio on public luxury.
107560	109280	Welcome, George.
109280	110800	Hi, how are you doing?
110800	116840	George, right now it feels like everything is going to shit on multiple levels, actually.
116840	126120	And more and more people, I would say, are starting to feel the pressure that the current polycrisis is exerting in their own lives.
126120	134040	In these times, a positive and attractive alternative notion of what the future could hold for all of us is very much needed.
134080	142240	And not only does it need to be positive, but it crucially also needs to feel possible and tangible, I would say.
142240	147720	So people will need to hear it and be able to say, yeah, I could imagine that to happen.
147720	151560	We need to fight for it for sure, but it could happen.
151560	160720	So you have used the idea of public luxury as a carrier for such an alternative notion of our collective futures.
160720	163000	Could you maybe explain to us what you mean by that?
163000	165720	What is public luxury?
165720	175640	The idea comes from the thought that there simply is not enough ecological space or even physical space for everyone to pursue private luxury.
175640	185360	The promise of capitalism and the reason why so many people go along with it and accept this extremely destructive,
185360	191200	world eating system is that they believe they are temporarily embarrassed millionaires.
191200	195840	They think that one day the finger will point at them because that is a promise.
195840	200200	The promise is that we can all aspire to private luxury.
200200	203120	That's why we buy into it, literally.
203120	206840	But we can't. And there's a couple of reasons why we can't.
206840	213320	The first is that some people can achieve private luxury because they exploit other people.
213320	220440	The extreme wealth of those who live in luxury is a result of the exploitation of those who don't.
220440	227400	So simply in basic mathematical terms, you can't have everyone at the top.
227400	236000	You know, the promise of capitalism is that everyone can be number one, but there are basic arithmetic reasons why that cannot work.
236000	248120	But there's also an even bigger reason, which is that if everyone achieved private luxury, we would burn through the living planet in a matter of days.
248360	260760	The ecological footprint of the very rich is massively greater than the footprint of the median or especially the poorer citizens of the world.
260760	266280	So it's simply impossible to fulfill the promise of capitalism.
266280	269680	And you can't even do it in terms of physical space.
269720	278320	If everyone in London had their own swimming pool and their own tennis court and their own art collection and their own playground for their kids,
278320	281920	then London would occupy a large proportion of England.
281920	285760	Where would everyone else live? England would occupy a large proportion of Europe.
285760	290440	It's just not enough planet, even in physical terms.
290440	306520	But public luxury, which means magnificent public swimming pools and tennis courts and art collections and playgrounds and public transport and all the other things that people try to achieve with their own money.
306520	314720	But if we achieve it together, not only does that create space for people rather than taking it away from everyone else,
314760	332400	but it can also be achieved at much, much lower ecological cost because you need only create one set of tennis courts or one large swimming pool for thousands and thousands of people to use rather than individuating the provision as private luxury does.
332400	338560	And so my call is for what I call private sufficiency, public luxury.
338560	352480	I think it's perfectly legitimate for us all to have our own modest private domain, our own modest home and the particular things that we need to lead a decent life within that home.
352480	357920	But if we want to aspire to luxury, we should do it within the public domain.
357920	366200	That doesn't just mean state provision, incidentally, it can also mean community ownership of resources, which in some cases can be more appropriate.
366240	376160	OK, maybe let's dig a little deeper into that and maybe paint a picture that has a bit more detail when it comes to how this might play out for all of us.
376160	381040	Because as you pointed out, there's an upper limit and there's a lower limit.
381040	383800	So what would these lives look like?
383800	391800	What would be examples for public luxury, but also for the sufficiency that we will engage in?
391800	397480	So how much is luxury in the public sphere and how much is sufficiency in the private sphere?
397480	403440	It's hard to draw hard and fast boundaries, not least because the science keeps changing.
403440	407240	We keep discovering, well, how much tighter it's getting every year.
407240	414280	There was a new paper published just two weeks ago showing that we at current levels of emissions,
414280	423680	we really have just six years left before we exceed a 50% chance of breaching 1.5 degrees of global heating.
423680	427320	And so there's almost no space left.
427320	431560	We have an extremely tight carbon budget.
431560	434200	Ecological budgets could be even tighter.
434200	442360	I mean, we are breaching planetary boundaries left, right and centre, you know, the planetary boundaries framework,
442360	451240	which has been established by scientists is very useful, but it's quite crude at the same time because it lumps everything together.
451240	459880	You know, it looks at novel substances, for instance, or it looks at biodiversity loss or it looks at land use transformation.
459880	466960	But these things within them, there are thousands of different ecosystems and thousands of different impacts taking place.
466960	478360	And when you break it down in a more granular way, you see that we are just on the cusp of pushing loads of ecosystems past their tipping points.
478360	486160	If you look at what's going on in marine systems, for instance, combination of industrial fishing, of pollution,
486160	494440	of global heating and the acidification of the seas, it's already destroying tropical coral reefs.
494440	497400	It's destroying entire ecosystems.
497400	500240	We've seen it with the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.
500240	501880	You know, people say it's fisheries collapse.
501880	504240	It's not ecosystem collapse.
504240	508600	We see it again and again and again, cascading collapse all over marine systems.
508600	516200	We've seen it very similarly in many terrestrial systems, perhaps the most dangerous of which from the human point of view is the collapse of soil.
516200	519320	Ninety nine percent of our calories come from the soil.
519320	524400	And basically, in all these cases, the more we know, the worse the situation looks.
524400	527360	So the tighter the budget has to be.
527360	539640	A few years ago, people were saying, well, the sustainable budget for carbon emissions or greenhouse gas emissions is equivalent to two tons of carbon per person per year.
539640	542200	It's a lot tighter than that now.
542200	548880	I haven't seen a calculation published in 2023, but it's almost certainly below one ton.
548880	565800	And yet the one percent on average are using 70 tons of carbon per year, whereas billionaires on average use about seven thousand tons to in some cases, 20 or 30 thousand tons of carbon per year.
565800	571520	Now, you know, let's go back to the promise of capitalism is that we're all going to be those people one day.
571520	572920	Well, how is that possible?
572920	584080	It just can't be done. You can't all run private jets and super yachts and giga homes and all the other appurtenances of being a billionaire.
584080	591840	So it's all we can say for sure is that it's really, really tight and it's probably tighter even than we think.
591840	593800	We're in emergency mode now.
594680	603520	And of course, that's a very dangerous situation politically as well as ecologically, because it means we're hitting political cliff edges.
603520	608640	And we've seen in the Netherlands what happens when you hit that cliff edge.
608640	620000	So scientists have been warning in the Netherlands that it had a nitrate crisis from the 1980s onwards, but the successive governments were very slow to act.
620080	628560	They didn't put in the measures which could have addressed that problem slowly and painlessly,
628560	639560	where every year you can just dial it down a little bit until you get below the limits you need to reach in order not to cause ecosystem collapse.
639560	647520	But because governments kept kicking the ball forward to the next administration and the next one and the next one, it's not my problem.
647520	654160	It's within the next four or five years, it's not going to mature as a problem, so we can just leave it.
654160	660160	You get to a situation where suddenly there's a legal challenge.
660160	661960	It's breaking European law.
661960	675520	The State Council says you have to take action and you have to go from a situation of massive nitrate pollution to very little nitrate pollution within an extremely short space of time.
675560	683760	And that means taking quite drastic political action, including saying we're going to have to shut down certain livestock operations.
683760	688320	And that then triggers a massive political backlash, as we've seen.
688320	696840	And what I fear is that we're going to see very similar situations on one ecological issue after another.
696880	704200	But because governments all around the world have failed to take action, if we're going to stop Earth systems from tipping,
704200	711000	they're going to have to take very sudden and very drastic action, and that will trigger a massive political backlash.
711000	714280	And they know that, so they're not going to take it.
714280	726680	And rather than face the prospect of losing office, they prefer to face the prospect of losing Earth systems, of creating basically an uninhabitable planet.
726680	729160	So we're not in a good place.
729160	735840	You know, always when we're discussing these issues, you say, well, I wouldn't start from here.
735840	739520	But unfortunately, we don't have much choice about that.
739520	741840	This is where we are. It's a bad place.
741840	746280	And just just to add to this, I hope you don't mind me sort of riffing on this a bit,
746280	752560	because it's uppermost in my mind at the moment because of the dire situation we're in in the UK.
752600	759680	And the UK is a very good example of how badly wrong things can go, even in an extremely rich nation,
759680	766760	a nation which has been exploiting much of the world for centuries, harvested a huge amount of money and wealth,
766760	776360	and yet is now facing extreme social dislocation, extreme poverty and the collapse of public services.
776360	780320	And that's the result of 40 years of neoliberalism.
780320	781840	We call it different things.
781840	787000	Some people say, oh, it's Thatcherism, it's Reaganism, it's austerity, it's trussonomics.
787000	791960	There's all these sort of individuated names for what it is, but it's not.
791960	795640	It's the same doctrine which has been pursued now for about 40 years.
795640	802600	And the result is that we have massive funding deficits in just about every single public sector.
802600	809160	So in some of them, they are quite clearly estimated in the National Health Service, for instance.
809200	816440	It's a 200 billion pound deficit since the Conservatives came back into office in 2010.
816440	819760	For sewerage, it's about 600 billion.
819760	828920	The rest of the water system would probably take that up to around a trillion pounds that need to be spent to get a 21st century water and sewage system in this country.
828920	837960	We've got a crisis of school buildings collapsing because they were built with inferior materials and they weren't designed to last and they've never been upgraded.
837960	842280	There hasn't been a full school rebuilding program for a long time.
842280	845960	That would be a few more hundred billion to resolve.
845960	851320	Similarly, with a lot of domestic buildings, we now see big tower blocks in danger of collapse.
851320	857200	We still see them covered in flammable cladding, which could cause more Grenfell tower disasters.
857200	863000	We've got a massive deficit in the provision of social housing, probably another trillion or so.
863000	877720	You start adding it up and you are talking many trillions of pounds of spending if we are to just sort of get back to a situation in which there is general provision for the people in this country.
877720	881400	So it is a very dire situation.
881400	883800	We have this great crunch coming.
883800	886200	We've got the ecological crunch.
886200	887640	People talk about a climate crisis.
887640	893800	It's an Earth systems crisis as every single Earth system now is heading towards tipping points.
893800	907800	And we have a massive fiscal crunch as a result of these years and years and years of neoliberal austerity, cutting public services and diverting the money instead into the pockets of the very rich.
907800	919240	And at the same time, we have a number of other global crises which we are completely failing to address, like, for instance, the food crisis.
919240	926120	And we didn't really have much of a food crisis until recently because it all looked as if it was heading in the right direction.
926120	936800	There were quite strong hopes that we were going to meet sustainable development goal 2.1, which is eliminating global hunger by 2030.
936800	942440	The trend was heading clearly in that direction from the 1960s until 2014.
942440	945520	There was a very steep decline in global hunger.
945520	947160	It was looking great.
947160	950320	And then in 2015, it started ticking up again.
950320	962000	And now we've already lost about 10 years of that progress because there's an extra 120 million people hungry now, even by comparison to 2019.
962000	964440	It's a really, really frightening situation.
964440	981720	And what we could be seeing on top of everything else is systemic global food system failure, similar to the failure of the financial system in 2008, which was just about to collapse before it was bailed out with massive government spending.
981720	984680	Can we bail out the food system?
984680	988440	They managed to save the financial system by inventing future money.
988440	991320	Quantitative easing was the creation of future money.
991320	994920	You can't save the food system by creating future food.
994920	998400	So we've got all these massive converging crises.
998400	1000840	You talk of a poly crisis, you're quite right to do so.
1000840	1005640	But I think it's even bigger, much, much bigger than most people assume.
1005640	1020880	So, you know, I know we're trying to be optimistic here and we will come to this, but we just have to accept the reality of how blinking difficult this is, of how many things are all converging at the same time
1020880	1035640	and how we will look back to the past 60 or 70 years, well, really since about 1945 as being a golden era by comparison to everything that will follow.
1035640	1037600	There is no repeating that time.
1037600	1040360	We burnt through resources at a phenomenal rate.
1040360	1042400	We can't do that anymore.
1042400	1049000	That helped generate a great deal of liquid wealth with which we were able to build public services.
1049000	1057280	But that then was reversed deliberately and very effectively through the neoliberal era from about 1979 onwards.
1057280	1063200	And and the deficits are such that we will never, ever plug those holes.
1063200	1071440	We won't get to back to the era of generalized prosperity that we had before that we just have to accept.
1071440	1081840	So we have to make the best of a very difficult and shall we say suboptimal situation and we have very little time in which to do it.
1081840	1094480	And so as a result of that, we have to use all remaining available resources, planetary and financial, as efficiently and parsimoniously as we possibly can.
1094480	1101120	And that is a very powerful reason, I believe, for pursuing public luxury rather than private luxury.
1101120	1109800	Right. And I think also it's an important point when it comes to this political question that you addressed, because we will have to get people on board.
1109800	1117760	And you stated that the form of luxury that we had here in the West for some time now will have to have an end.
1117760	1131400	But at the same time, it's equally in a reality that for most of the people globally, the form of public luxury that you're envisioning is very much a better living standard.
1131400	1137640	So there is a very attractive offer encapsulated in this idea of public luxury.
1137640	1149400	And I'm very curious about this offer, because I think while it is super important to point out the urgency and the factor of disaster that is happening in front of our eyes,
1149400	1156120	as you did right now, it's equally important to point out that there is something to gain for the many.
1156120	1159720	And this is, as I understand it, this idea of public luxury.
1159720	1173640	So maybe we could get into what this actually might entail, because there's also this framework of universal basic services, for example, floating around, which is quite similar in a certain sense.
1173640	1181240	So what would be covered through public luxury? And would it be unconditional? Because this is also quite attractive.
1181240	1191120	Yes, yes. So the first thing I want to say is that I don't want my proposals to compete in any way with other proposals such as universal basic services.
1191120	1201600	I think they're totally compatible. I think they they're complementary to each other, because, as the name suggests, universal basic services is not really in the business of supplying luxuries,
1201600	1213080	but it's in the business of making sure that our necessities are met and that everyone has free access to those necessities, which is obviously an absolutely essential component.
1213080	1221480	And so I guess you would really say, actually, we need three things. We need private sufficiency, we need universal basic services, and we need public luxury.
1221480	1227600	And I don't want to sort of bundle those basic services into public luxury, because they are slightly different things.
1227600	1237000	And public luxury obviously is not unlimited, because there will always be limitations on what we can do, and we have to accept those limitations.
1237000	1250520	And in fact, accepting limitations, the idea of we can have enough and then we can stop when we've got enough, I think is absolutely essential to being responsible 21st century citizens
1250520	1256000	and to ensuring that you can have realistic political aims.
1256000	1268680	So that's quite an important component of it, is to say, don't expect the moon on a stick, but do expect the one habitable planet that we know of to be habitable for everyone,
1268680	1274200	and that everyone can have a decent quality of life, but not a massive quantity of life.
1274440	1281280	That's really the promise we should be making to ourselves and to everyone else.
1281280	1290400	So what would it look like? Well, if we look at the public domain, for instance, one of the first things, the most visible thing, the most obvious thing,
1290400	1300120	and perhaps the most important thing that you need to be looking at is land, is who controls it, who has access to it, who's using it, and for what purposes?
1300840	1306240	These are really important questions and perennially neglected in politics.
1306240	1317600	Land is, oh, well, that's the place where you put houses, and obviously we need houses and we need to allocate land carefully and we need farming and lots of other things.
1317600	1325840	But we also, to create anything like a high quality of human life and viable communities, you need public land.
1325840	1336280	You need land that everyone can use, land that everyone can enjoy, land where they can meet each other, land where they can exercise, land where they can have fun,
1336280	1346000	all the things which make our lives worth living happen in that public domain, and the public domain has to have a physical base to it.
1346000	1353960	And I'm not saying that it's all going to be open land, there needs to be land in which you can build public buildings and do indoor activities,
1353960	1365440	which are luxurious and which enhance our quality of life, such as a luxurious indoor swimming pool, for instance, and other great community facilities that you can envisage.
1365440	1376400	But it's allocating that land is really at the core of it, and to say we are setting aside land which cannot be captured by private interests,
1376400	1385760	which cannot be enclosed, to use the old term of the capture of land by private interests, and will belong to the public.
1385760	1388840	And as I said before, that doesn't necessarily mean the state.
1388840	1395320	In many cases, it's far more appropriate that it belongs to the community and becomes a commons.
1395320	1398560	And a commons really is at the core of this.
1398560	1403120	Commons is a crucial, neglected sphere of the economy.
1403160	1412000	It's not private, it's not state, it's not capitalist, it's not communist, it's a different sphere altogether.
1412000	1417160	A commons is a resource which is managed by a community.
1417160	1428400	Nobody owns it definitively because you have a duty to pass it down to future generations in the same or better state in which you found it.
1428400	1436400	It's either the resource itself or the output of the resource is shared equally between the members of the community,
1436400	1442320	and it creates benefits for everyone who is involved in it.
1442320	1448840	And we have some very good examples in all over Europe, the public park, which is owned by communities.
1448840	1456240	There are some, some of them are mostly state controlled, but community owned parks are a great example of a land based commons.
1456280	1463320	In the UK, we have a system called allotments where land is set aside for people to grow food on.
1463320	1470000	And this was, it was basically a sort of substitute for the proper land reform that we needed in this country.
1470000	1471800	It was a bit of a sop.
1471800	1478640	We say, OK, we've taken most of the land away from you, we'll give a little bit back so that you can feel it hasn't all gone.
1478640	1483880	And actually, these allotments have turned out to be really important for people's wellbeing.
1483880	1492400	I had an allotment for a long time in the previous place I lived in, and I don't know how I would have coped without it.
1492400	1498520	It was really important for my mental health, but also for my connections with the community.
1498520	1500840	So this was an area of land.
1500840	1510040	It was, could only have been about three, four hectares, maybe it divided into 200 little plots, each of which was calculated,
1510040	1515920	estimated to be the amount of land from which a family could provide itself with vegetables.
1515920	1520280	That's basically what the size of the plot was based on.
1520280	1524760	And so, yeah, 220 in total, 220 plots in this.
1524760	1531840	And all of them quite intensely cultivated and some of them very productive, some more successful than others,
1531840	1538120	but producing really quite a large amount of food for the amount of land involved.
1538120	1545800	I mean, just a small proportion of the city's food, obviously, because there's only small amounts of land handed over.
1545800	1552600	But on that allotment, it was controlled entirely by the allotment holders.
1552600	1560520	So you had a members association of the 220 allotment holders who would make the decisions as to how the land was used and allocated.
1560520	1565560	It was technically owned by the council, but we actually had rights in perpetuity.
1565560	1575520	So there was a sort of co-ownership with the council and it was controlled entirely by its own members, which is a crucial aspect of the Commons.
1575520	1584480	And what it did, apart from giving you this outdoor space where it was yours, but not just yours,
1584480	1591400	and it was almost like having a garden which you couldn't otherwise afford with your small house.
1591400	1596240	It also introduced you to communities you might never otherwise have met.
1596240	1603080	And one of the amazing features of this was that across those 220 plots,
1603080	1609120	there were people who must have come from about 30 or 40 countries of origin from all over the world.
1609120	1616000	It was quite extraordinary, the amazing diversity of languages, of experiences, of stories.
1616040	1621440	And you meet each other on equal terms because you've all got the same amount of land.
1621440	1624160	You're all struggling with similar constraints.
1624160	1630560	You've got the problems with the weather, you've got pests, you've got issues with soil, whatever.
1630560	1637640	And so you're constantly swapping expertise, giving seeds to each other, swapping produce.
1637640	1641800	The people on the plot next door to me were Serbian refugees.
1641840	1646480	And they really loved the plums and medlars that I was growing on my allotment.
1646480	1648840	And we had a massive surplus of plums.
1648840	1651680	We couldn't eat them all ourselves.
1651680	1655840	And we never quite got the hang of cooking with medlars.
1655840	1661800	But in the Balkans, medlars, this quite obscure fruit, are very, very popular.
1661800	1666480	And so we gave them our medlars and quite a few of our plums and some of our apples.
1666480	1670720	And they gave us some wonderful vegetables, beans and potatoes and chard
1670720	1672520	and other things that they were growing.
1672520	1677160	And we learned quite a lot from each other, not just about growing, but about cooking.
1677160	1680400	But then also, we told our stories.
1680400	1686920	So you can see how land can instantly start to bring people together.
1686920	1690200	And food can bring people together as well.
1690200	1695080	And the word companion comes from the Latin companes, with bread.
1695080	1698960	And a companion is someone with whom you break bread.
1698960	1702520	And so having places in which you can have community meals,
1702520	1706160	luxurious community meals, where you can all come together,
1706160	1708360	prepare something together, eat it together.
1708360	1714720	Instead of going to a fancy restaurant, you effectively create in the public domain
1714720	1720400	the equivalent of a fancy restaurant, which is much, much cheaper and is not exclusive.
1720400	1724960	That's the key thing, that fancy restaurants, of course, are exclusive.
1724960	1727760	Only a small proportion of the population could afford to eat there.
1727760	1733000	But everyone can afford to have luxurious community meals,
1733000	1736760	where you get together in a common space.
1736760	1742640	I think we kind of get to a point where a certain question needs to be answered,
1742640	1747280	because you already pointed towards the commons as a really crucial element in this.
1747280	1755040	And you pointed towards the inefficiency as well as the excluding element of private property,
1755040	1760800	because private property is not able to produce this type of community that you're right now talking about.
1760800	1765840	So if we're talking about land reform, and we should, as you rightly stated,
1765840	1775000	so then we will get into a conflict with those who right now own this land as private property.
1775000	1782640	So there will be some kind of conflict to be had in order to get to this state
1782640	1787000	where things are held in common as commons.
1787000	1791840	So I would be interested because this is also, of course, an element of public luxury.
1791840	1797160	You have this private sufficiency, which means, of course, many will gain a lot.
1797160	1800520	And this will be super attractive, hopefully for the many.
1800520	1805560	But there are the few who will lose out, and they should.
1805560	1811040	But right now, as it happens, those are the people who have the political power,
1811040	1812680	they have the economic power.
1812680	1817680	And I'm sorry, but I have to add they have also the military power.
1817680	1823600	And if we think of something like the democratic socialism of Salvador Allende and how this played out,
1823600	1826440	we will have to think about this as well.
1826440	1833440	So how do we get to a point where we will be able to implement this type of sharing in common,
1833440	1839600	which will lead to us sustaining the planet in a way that is actually sustaining it?
1839600	1844480	Yes, thanks. Again, we have to concede all this is very difficult.
1844480	1849720	You know, if I were to come on this podcast and say, yeah, it's easy, we just do it like this,
1849720	1851600	then I would be lying to you.
1851600	1858000	You know, we're up against a lot of constraints, not least because, as you so rightly say,
1858000	1859720	they have the resources and they have the power.
1859720	1861440	And this hasn't come about by accident.
1861440	1867560	Part of the whole point of neoliberalism was to turn economic power into political power,
1867880	1872760	to return to a situation of plutocracy, to displace democracy.
1872760	1874600	That was very much a thrust of it.
1874600	1879280	William Davis at Goldsmith College has a lovely definition of neoliberalism,
1879280	1882600	which is the disenchantment of politics by economics.
1882600	1886440	And it's basically it was an assault on democracy.
1886440	1890720	I mean, democracy is a problem that capitalism is always trying to solve.
1890720	1896080	And neoliberal ideology is a very effective means of solving that problem.
1896080	1902600	And what we've seen worldwide is power being sucked out of democratic institutions.
1902600	1906560	They've been hollowed out, as Professor Colin Crouch has argued.
1906560	1911680	And you end up with a kind of neutron bomb politics where you've still got the institution
1911680	1916400	standing, you've still got the buildings, you've still got the protocols, you've still got
1916400	1918360	parliament sitting and talking.
1918360	1921560	But actually, power has bled away into other spheres.
1921560	1927480	It's gone into private discussions between governments and oligarchs.
1927480	1934440	It's gone offshore, like the offshore arbitration tribunals, the investor state dispute settlement
1934440	1939080	mechanisms, which basically override democratic decision making.
1939080	1943800	Corporations can sue states for decisions they don't like, and those states are forced
1943800	1949840	to hand over billions and billions of dollars because they've upset corporate plans for
1949840	1952120	making vast amounts of money.
1952120	1959840	There's lots of ways in which power has been bled out, sucked away from citizens and handed
1959840	1964800	over to oligarchs, plutocrats, kleptocrats around the world.
1964800	1970040	When neoliberals say, let the market decide, we should examine what that thing, the market
1970040	1971040	means.
1971040	1973200	It's basically let the money decide.
1973200	1977600	And when you let the money decide, you let the people with the most money decide.
1977600	1980360	It's basically saying, let the plutocrats decide.
1980360	1981580	That's what it really means.
1981580	1983400	And that's what has been happening.
1983400	1988880	And they have gained power immensely at our expense.
1988880	1990760	You mentioned Salvador Allende.
1990760	1997600	That was done in a very crude way, a military coup supported by not just Western governments,
1997600	2004720	but the neoliberal economists trained specifically for what turned into Pinochet's economics
2004720	2010840	at the University of Chicago and elsewhere, and implemented the full neoliberal agenda
2010840	2012560	there following the coup.
2012560	2018240	But it's been done more subtly and slowly in other nations where it would be harder
2018240	2022520	to overthrow them with a coup, but with similar end results.
2022520	2029000	It's a bit like the famous phrase in Africa, when the white man came to Africa, we had
2029000	2030940	the land and he had the Bible.
2030940	2035060	He told us to close our eyes and pray, and when we opened them, he had the land and we
2035060	2036500	had the Bible.
2036500	2038820	And it's a bit like that with neoliberalism.
2038820	2040780	You can say that.
2040780	2045980	When the neoliberals turned up, we had the public sphere.
2045980	2049500	We were in control of politics.
2049500	2052900	And they had the road to serfdom and the constitution of liberty.
2052900	2058260	They told us to close our eyes, grab hold of these books, and by the time we opened
2058260	2060380	them, they had everything.
2060380	2065660	And to hell with the supposed neoliberal principles in those books, it was socialism
2065660	2069500	for the rich and neoliberalism for the poor.
2069500	2076020	And so again, we're in a very difficult position where we have to displace that existing power
2076020	2083620	in order to return both to democracy and to a lively public sphere, and that includes
2083620	2084620	land.
2085020	2091180	Now, there are plenty of nonviolent mechanisms of doing this, and taxation is the most obvious
2091180	2092180	one.
2092180	2097540	You start introducing land taxes, you make it expensive for people to own large tracts
2097540	2106060	of land which could be in the public domain, and you can start to push it in a more democratic
2106060	2107100	direction.
2107100	2111540	But as you say, people are going to resist this, and people with the power will resist
2111540	2112540	this very hard.
2113300	2118900	The only thing that is in our favor is that we are many and they are few.
2118900	2123260	They might have the money, they might have the media, they might have the era of government,
2123260	2125780	they might have the weapons.
2125780	2129740	It does require massive, massive mobilization.
2129740	2135560	And we've seen there are many instances in history where mass mobilization overturned
2135560	2138700	extremely rigid power structures.
2138700	2142460	I think that society is a complex system, right?
2142460	2146500	And all complex systems have equilibrium states and they have tipping points, and they can
2146500	2149940	tip from one equilibrium state into a different equilibrium state.
2149940	2152700	And society, I believe, has two equilibrium states.
2152700	2155420	One is impossible, the other is inevitable.
2155420	2160820	And at any one time, you say your situation is impossible.
2160820	2163020	It appears to be impossible.
2163020	2169220	If you looked at women's suffrage, for instance, if you went to the 1890s in most parts of
2169220	2172620	Europe and said, will women ever have the vote?
2172620	2173620	Impossible.
2173620	2175420	It's just not going to happen.
2175420	2178380	The patriarchal system is simply too powerful.
2178380	2181260	The men are never going to give up 50% of their power.
2181260	2182420	How is that ever going to happen?
2182420	2184860	It's just impossible.
2184860	2187900	And within a few decades, it became inevitable.
2187900	2191140	Once it had happened, you look back and say, well, of course that was going to happen.
2191140	2193220	How can that not happen?
2193220	2198180	And the same goes, for instance, with gay rights and equal marriage.
2198180	2203540	In the 1980s, if you'd said, what are the prospects across Western Europe for equal
2203540	2204780	marriage?
2204780	2209460	Equal marriage legislation passed by governments, impossible.
2209460	2211180	Society is homophobic.
2211180	2214360	Homophobia has been there for centuries.
2214360	2217460	It's just part of how society is.
2217460	2219500	We're up against the conservatives.
2219500	2220780	We're up against the church.
2220780	2224580	We're up against all these massive forces in society.
2224580	2226980	Then a few decades later, well, of course that was going to happen.
2226980	2227980	It's inevitable.
2227980	2232340	Same with abortion, same with certain aspects of women's liberation, obviously still a long
2232340	2233540	way to go.
2233540	2235020	Same with smoking.
2235020	2242380	When I was in my 20s, quite a long time ago, every public space was just a fog of blue
2242380	2243980	smoke.
2243980	2248500	And now in my country, if you see anyone smoking, it's like they're at high school again, hiding
2248500	2249500	behind the dustbins.
2249820	2253580	It's furtively taking a cigarette.
2253580	2258020	We see these tipping points have happened again and again and again, and in every case,
2258020	2261860	they've gone from impossible to inevitable.
2261860	2263220	It can't happen.
2263220	2264500	It was bound to happen.
2264500	2270220	Those are the two equilibrium states for any issue in society, and they tip.
2270220	2277860	So it's very easy to create a completely pessimistic picture and say, that can't possibly happen.
2277900	2282980	What I sketched out at the beginning sounded pretty pessimistic, but that's only because
2282980	2287140	we are always trapped within our moment.
2287140	2292900	We conceive the future as repeated instances of the present, and we imagine it can't possibly
2292900	2293900	change.
2293900	2299900	But that's because we tend to regard society as if it were a simple system and not a complex
2299900	2300900	system.
2300900	2304140	And this is, I think, one of the greatest deficits in our education.
2304140	2311100	So few of us are ever taught in school or even in university about how complex systems
2311100	2312180	function.
2312180	2314020	We're taught about complex systems.
2314020	2315300	We're taught about ecosystems.
2315300	2320980	We're taught about social systems, but we're taught about them as if they were simple systems,
2320980	2326660	like circuit diagrams, as if it were an electrical circuit or a plumbing map.
2326660	2329020	This is how the economy works.
2329020	2331140	This is how an ecosystem works.
2331140	2333660	But actually, it just doesn't work that way.
2333660	2337260	It works in completely different ways to a simple system.
2337260	2342500	Change does not happen in linear and gradual ways in a complex system.
2342500	2346900	It tends to absorb change, absorb change, absorb change, and during that whole time
2346900	2349380	it plateaus and you think, nothing's going to change.
2349380	2350380	This is just how it is.
2350380	2354420	And then suddenly, bang, it tips into a different state.
2354420	2359180	So this is absolutely not a council of despair.
2359660	2365780	At any moment in history, you would seem to have very good reasons for despair.
2365780	2368900	And then a few years later, you say, why was anybody despairing about that?
2368900	2370700	Of course it was going to happen.
2370700	2371700	Yeah.
2371700	2377460	And I for once am absolutely in the camp of alternative desirable futures can definitely
2377460	2382580	happen and actually they must happen or it will be barbarism for sure.
2382660	2389940	So you would not have to convince me, but I have to add that the examples that you gave
2389940	2399420	me, like gay rights or voting and stuff like that, that these are examples that are quite
2399420	2405340	a bit different from a crucial topic that will need to be addressed, which is property.
2405340	2411860	So we have been there before in our conversation and I think there's a really good question
2411860	2420020	that you asked within your text, which should be quite obvious, but which is so ingrained
2420020	2424580	in the form of naturalization of private property that people tend to not ask it.
2424580	2431860	And you ask, what gives you the right to appropriate parts of nature just because you have money?
2431860	2437180	So there's no intrinsic connection between the two actually, but in our societies, people
2437180	2440420	tend to believe there is, but it isn't.
2440420	2447180	So if we acknowledge this, that there is no intrinsic connection whatsoever between the
2447180	2456100	two, then we would get to a place where the whole way in which we engage with nature,
2456100	2463420	the let's say socio-metabolic mechanism that we set up for our social relation with nature,
2463420	2470060	that this will need to be based on fundamentally different paradigms, so to speak, not paradigms
2470100	2477460	that derive rights of nature abuse from money and private property, but they will have to
2477460	2480060	be enacted in a very different way.
2480060	2487300	And there is a, I think, interesting and very much related research strand around questions
2487300	2492380	of democratic economic planning or democratic planning in a more broader sense that I think
2492380	2496300	would be a very fruitful ally in this.
2496300	2501620	And I would be interested if this is something that you engage with, because if we say that
2501620	2508980	money should, and markets for that matter, should not be the steering mechanism or at
2508980	2514060	least the dominant steering mechanism through which this relation is mediated, then the
2514060	2517220	question comes up, what should it be then?
2517220	2518660	What would be the alternative?
2518660	2523100	And of course, the first thing that comes up is it should be democratic, but then the
2523180	2526820	questions actually come up even more.
2526820	2530260	So I would be interested, what is your thinking around these questions?
2530260	2533220	Because they are so crucial and the heart of the whole thing, I would say.
2533220	2535660	Yeah, no, all good and absolutely crucial questions.
2535660	2540700	I would actually say they're not that different from the women's suffrage question, because
2540700	2549460	if you go back to the 19th century, it was just an absolutely implicit plank of political
2549460	2553100	systems that men should control and even own women.
2553100	2558660	There were legal instruments giving men effective ownership over women and ownership over all
2558660	2563500	their resources, ownership of their decision-making, all of that.
2563500	2570300	And it was just for the great part of society unquestioned, that was just the way it was.
2570300	2576340	And just as there is no intrinsic connection between the numbers in your bank account and
2576340	2581780	your right to own vast tracts of natural wealth, there was no intrinsic connection
2581780	2585460	between being male and your right to own and control women.
2585460	2588700	But those things were assumed to be one and the same.
2588700	2590620	And so, sorry, go on, yeah.
2590620	2596300	No, just to clarify this, I think for me, the difference is that women's right to vote
2596300	2600900	could be easily integrated into capitalism, as well as gay rights could be.
2600900	2608980	So this is something that can be included in a way that will make sure that still certain
2608980	2611200	elements will not be touched.
2611200	2614860	And one of these elements that should not be touched through the eyes of capitalism
2614860	2616420	is the question of property rights.
2616420	2617420	Yes.
2617420	2618420	Well, that's true.
2618420	2622520	But then they could not be integrated into patriarchy, which was another immensely powerful
2622520	2626780	force where it said there's all sorts of untouchables here.
2626780	2632620	So all I'm saying is there's no reason to despair because these are completely different
2632620	2633620	questions.
2633620	2639540	It was just as implausible a few decades before it happened that women would get the vote
2639540	2646700	as it is that we could have a democratic use of property and a democratized economy.
2646700	2650380	And the necessity, the urgency is just as great.
2650380	2655620	And the barriers are, I think, probably no greater than the barriers that women faced.
2655620	2660220	And that might sound ridiculous because the barriers seem enormous, but from the perspective
2660220	2664620	of women in the late 19th century, those barriers were just as great.
2664620	2666940	It was just as impossible.
2666940	2672260	And so we are in the impossible equilibrium state, but there is an inevitable equilibrium
2672260	2675860	state as well, which can be reached.
2675860	2679940	Now the question is, can it be reached without crisis?
2679940	2680940	Almost certainly not.
2681180	2689180	There will be crises which both will be extremely tough, but also create opportunities for changing
2689180	2694420	things and for saying, well, this system does not work.
2694420	2698700	How much more obvious can it be that this system does not work?
2698700	2706540	And yes, what we have to do is to challenge something as fundamental to social conditioning
2706540	2708560	as patriarchy was.
2708560	2713720	And that fundamental thing we have to challenge is that some people have more right to the
2713720	2716840	world's natural wealth than other people have.
2716840	2724720	And there's absolutely no principle, no sound principle, which says that some people should
2724720	2728840	have that right, should have a greater right than others to natural wealth.
2728840	2735760	But it's just an assumption which is soaked into society in exactly the same way that
2735760	2740960	the assumption that men should have control over women was soaked into society.
2740960	2746680	So impossible things can change and can then become inevitable.
2746680	2751520	I'm sorry to keep repeating myself on this, but it's such an important thing for people
2751520	2752520	to grasp.
2752520	2757040	But your situation now doesn't have to be your situation in the future.
2757040	2765160	I would like to get a bit of a better sense of what the political imaginary, the broader
2765160	2771120	political imaginary is that you situate public luxury within.
2771120	2775880	Because I mean, you pointed towards the commons and you stated it's not markets, it's not
2775880	2777880	communism either, you stated.
2777880	2783680	So you kind of draw some kind of line there, I guess, or something like that.
2783680	2789960	But I would be interested in who would be the ally with which something like that would
2789960	2790960	be possible.
2791280	2797360	I live in Vienna and we have a strong social democratic basis here in Vienna, of course,
2797360	2803360	and we have some form of public luxury, at least in some parts of our lives.
2803360	2806800	And I really very much appreciate, I have to say.
2806800	2814680	But at the same time, social democracy historically has a certain tendency to kind of part with
2814680	2822840	capital or to have a pact with capital when it comes to crucial moments within our history.
2822840	2829560	So my interest would be to hear something about the political imaginary and also the,
2829560	2835200	let's say, maybe political platform that you imagine as a carrier through which public
2835200	2837640	luxury can come about.
2837640	2844160	So I'm very interested in the ideas of Murray Bookchin and his social ecology thinking.
2844160	2848880	I don't think he's got quite all the answers, but I think there's quite a lot in there about
2848880	2855240	how you can create political systems which are distributive by design, as Kate Rayworth
2855240	2856240	would say.
2856240	2860720	I mean, I don't know what her relationship with Murray Bookchin is, but she uses a very
2860720	2866840	important phrase, distributive by design, and that's what Murray Bookchin does with
2866840	2867840	his political thinking.
2868000	2874200	I mean, he's no longer alive, but he had a great influence over some people's political
2874200	2875200	development.
2875200	2880240	The most obvious example of that is Rojava in the sort of semi-autonomous region in northeastern
2880240	2886960	Syria where under extreme difficulty, attacks from all sides really, the local people of
2886960	2892320	Rojava have created a totally different political system to the one that we have.
2892320	2898000	Now, the political system, the majority of those of us who live in so-called democratic
2898000	2900040	systems have works like this.
2900040	2904040	Every four or five years, you put a cross on a piece of paper, and then you are deemed
2904040	2909360	to consent to everything that the winning side does in the next four or five years.
2909360	2915340	So anything that's in their manifesto, their platform that they campaigned on, you're deemed
2915340	2916740	to have consented to that.
2916740	2921480	Even if you didn't even vote for them, even if the people who did vote for them hadn't
2921520	2926160	actually read the manifesto, even if actually they were voting on just one issue, as most
2926160	2930680	people do, you know, it's like the economy or it's crime or something like that, you're
2930680	2936760	deemed to have consented to all the other issues in that manifesto and then to consent
2936760	2941800	to everything else that government chooses to do until you voted out of office in four
2941800	2942800	or five years.
2942800	2947280	In other words, the entire system is based on the principle of presumed consent.
2947720	2950320	Now, we don't accept presumed consent in sex.
2950640	2952480	Why should we accept it in politics?
2952800	2955880	But that is what our so-called democracies do.
2956760	2960840	But there's a completely different way of doing it, which is a bottom up way of doing
2960840	2966640	it. And instead of grand decisions being made by a tiny number of people and then passed
2966640	2972360	down to everyone else with this ridiculous system based on presumed consent, you have
2972360	2977520	a system where the people make the decisions and pass those on up to ensure that they're
2977520	2979600	implemented at the wider level.
2979920	2984560	And that's a system which Bookchin partly designed and which has been developed in
2984560	2989800	Rojava. But also, you see elements of it in other parts of the world.
2989800	2995200	And a classic example of that is in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, where between
2995480	3002680	particularly the years 1989 and 2004, over that 15 years when there was a PTA, Partido
3002680	3009360	dos Revalidores, government in Porto Alegre, they handed control of the municipal budget
3009600	3014840	over to the people. Porto Alegre had been one of the poorest places in Brazil because
3014840	3016840	it was more or less owned by the mafia.
3017680	3021040	It was completely dominated by corruption and clientelism.
3021440	3027280	When public money was spent, it was spent to favour your brother-in-law or the godfather
3027280	3029600	of this clan or whoever it might be.
3029960	3033120	And it was just wasted, completely frittered away.
3033640	3040000	By the time participatory budgeting had bedded in, Porto Alegre was number one in the
3040000	3043280	Human Development Index of all cities in Brazil.
3043760	3050120	And there'd been a total transformation of its fortunes, massive decline in maternal
3050120	3055680	mortality, massive decline in infant mortality, massively improved primary health care,
3055920	3060480	education, sanitation and clean water, public transport.
3061200	3065880	Because the people were making the decisions, the entire discretionary municipal budget
3065880	3070400	was in their hands. And every year about 50,000 people came together to decide how it was
3070400	3075840	spent. And there was a very clever design for passing up those decisions and for making
3075840	3077960	sure that the poorer areas didn't lose out.
3077960	3083400	There was a sort of ratio system so that the budget was distributed according to need,
3083400	3088600	but the decisions over the budget were made by local people.
3089240	3092880	And it just completely turned the city around.
3092880	3097280	And it ended up with the extraordinary result, which any political scientist would tell you
3097280	3104120	is impossible, of people taking to the streets and demonstrating to demand that their taxes
3104120	3109640	were raised. And the reason for that was that they could see that if they spent the money
3109640	3113120	together, it went a lot further than if they tried to spend it individually.
3113120	3118080	So, for instance, if you're trying to get to work in the morning and you're using private
3118080	3124400	transport, you might pay $2,000 for a clapped out old car and then be stuck in a traffic
3124400	3127480	jam for an hour on the way in and an hour on the way out.
3127480	3134760	Or you can contribute $100 a year for a modern, efficient public tram system or monorail or
3134760	3138560	whatever it might be and get there in 20 minutes rather than an hour.
3138560	3143160	Your money goes much, much further when you're spending it in the public domain.
3143200	3146080	And people saw that and acted on it.
3146080	3150960	And what we saw is that when the people are in charge, the decisions are much greener,
3150960	3156960	they're much fairer, they're much more egalitarian, and they're much more wide ranging than when
3156960	3162200	you've got a small group in charge who are deemed to be our democratic representatives.
3162200	3168280	Now, I think where I differ from Bookchin is that I think we need some representative
3168280	3175440	democracy as well, because there are certain decisions which it's very hard for participatory
3175440	3176640	democracy to make.
3176640	3181760	For instance, in terms of international policy, what do we do about climate policy?
3181760	3185480	What do we do about disarmament policy, for instance?
3185480	3187560	What do we do about trade policy?
3187560	3194080	It's very hard to pass it all the way up from the local borough or village level right up
3194080	3195360	to the global level like that.
3195360	3198800	So we need some intermediation as well.
3198800	3202360	But any decision which can be made locally should be made locally.
3202360	3205360	Everything should be devolved as much as possible.
3205360	3207440	But there are limits to that devolution.
3207440	3210480	So I would see a hybrid system.
3210480	3215040	But obviously, when you've got this mass participation, one of the things it does is it
3215040	3216200	transforms people.
3216200	3218720	It makes them into democratic citizens.
3218720	3221200	They realize that they should be in charge.
3221280	3226200	There's not a luxury to have genuine democratic engagement.
3226200	3229520	It's actually a necessity if you're going to have a good society.
3229520	3230880	And it's our right.
3230880	3236720	It's our right to have deliberative participatory politics rather than decisions handed down
3236720	3239680	from on high in the name of representative democracy.
3239680	3244380	And in fact, one of the fascinating aspects of participatory democracy is that it works
3244380	3246600	better in practice than it does in theory.
3246600	3250040	You have endless people saying, oh, that couldn't possibly work.
3250040	3251040	People wouldn't be like that.
3251040	3252560	They wouldn't behave like that.
3252560	3259560	But because it transforms people and because they see the immense power that they can wield
3259560	3266840	in a distributed and democratic way, then it works in ways which people couldn't predict.
3266840	3272800	And what that does then is to ensure that representative power, if you've still got
3272800	3276000	some representative democracy, can't get ahead of the people.
3276000	3281560	It can't run away from us because we become much more engaged and politically literate
3281560	3283400	citizens than we were before.
3283400	3284400	Wonderful.
3284400	3287320	Josh, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests.
3287320	3292640	And it is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
3292640	3299720	What makes me joyful is the incredible bravery of certain people and certain movements.
3299720	3305400	What we've seen all over the world, even in the most impossible situations, totalitarian
3305440	3311600	situations, situations where you can so easily be imprisoned for life or killed.
3311600	3317200	I mean, even today, you know, there are environmental activists all over the world being murdered
3317200	3318200	for their activism.
3318200	3319520	And yet they still do it.
3319520	3321160	They still stand up and do it.
3321160	3326200	And it's that human courage that makes me joyful because I realize that wherever there
3326200	3327760	is courage, there is hope.
