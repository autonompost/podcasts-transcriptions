1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,520
David Leibman in today's show.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,680
He is Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brooklyn College, New York and editor of the journals

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,960
Science and Society.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,020
David has written extensively about economic coordination and developed a model called

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,240
Multi-Level Democratic Iterative Coordination, which will be at the center of our conversation

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
today.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,680
I am absolutely thrilled that this episode came together and that it did so right now

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,160
because the new special issue of Science and Society's project Envisioning Socialism has

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,560
just been published and these special issues, they are released only once every 10 years

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,320
and are concerned with a topic that is of great importance for the investigations of

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,440
this podcast and that is democratic economic planning.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:07,560
The three predecessor issues appeared in Science and Society in Spring 1992, 2002 and 2012

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,360
and so I marked my calendar for Spring 2022 in order not to miss this very special opportunity

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,280
and I am very happy to announce that I did not only record the interview with David Leibman

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,360
that you are about to hear today, but also lengthy conversations with Robin Hannell and

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,920
with Pat Devine who are both, just like David, enormously important contributors not only

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,060
to these special issues starting from the first one in 1992, but they are also central

19
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,360
contributors to the debate around democratic economic planning in general.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,240
This means there will be quite a couple of English language future histories episodes

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,240
spread over this spring and summer devoted to the topic of democratic economic planning

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,240
and I have a couple of remarks regarding this.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,980
The first one would be to my German language audience, I am sorry, I had to do it, I simply

24
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:16,580
had to do this, Future Histories is a predominantly German language podcast and it will continue

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:25,080
to be so, but this was simply too perfect and so I couldn't resist and as regular listeners

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,380
will know, I argue for podcasting as a form of extended research practice and this deep

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:39,060
dive into democratic economic planning is to be understood as a part of exactly that.

28
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,580
So danke fÃ¼r eure Geduld, thank you for your patience with this long detour into English

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,960
language episodes and in the spirit of podcasting as research, I have an important plea directed

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,600
at all of you.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,580
At one point in the interview you are about to hear with David, he states, and I quote,

32
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,440
the truly international discussion is still in front of us, end quote, and I could not

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,280
agree more, so please, if you know about interesting positions on democratic economic planning

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
from the global south, then please write me.

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,940
If everything works out as planned, I will feature guests from Chile soon and planning

36
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,080
in Kerala, India is also on my radar, as is the history of Soviet cybernetics, but I cannot

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,720
stress this enough.

38
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,660
If you know about interesting contemporary thinkers or experiments in democratic economic

39
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,260
planning from the global south and non-western positions in general, then please write me.

40
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:52,200
You can reach me via jan at futurehistories.today, that's J-A-N at futurehistories.today.

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,060
Very much looking forward to hearing about all these different approaches and experiments

42
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,600
from all over the world.

43
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,760
So now please enjoy today's episode with David Leibman on multi-level democratic iterative

44
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
coordination.

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Welcome David.

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
Okay.

47
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Thank you Jan.

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,440
It's good to be here.

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,520
It's my pleasure.

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,840
Before we get to your model specifically, let's start with a very basic definition.

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,600
What is democratic economic planning?

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Okay.

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,540
I was going to back up a little further before that, but I'll get to democratic economic

54
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,040
planning in a moment.

55
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,940
I wanted to start by referring to all of the buzz in the world around the concept of socialism

56
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,180
as such.

57
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,420
There's a lot of discussion of socialism, a renewal of interest, and this is of course

58
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,300
very important for us, I think, and very important for the way the world is going to go.

59
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,340
So I wanted to suggest a few distinctions.

60
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:10,320
For many people, the word socialism means what I call ameliorative socialism, ameliorate,

61
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,760
make better, improve, and they can think of, and I can think of, all sorts of improvements

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,480
that we want to make in the world.

63
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,200
We want a world of equality, a world of solidarity, a world of participation, a world of security,

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
dignity.

65
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,160
These are some words that clearly come into the concept, and I'm happy to situate all

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,900
the work that I'm doing, and everyone who's working on what I call systemic socialism

67
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,940
would be part of, you know, we're all part of that, but we need to go further.

68
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:50,420
The second distinction is what I call inspirational socialism, and it takes its cue from some

69
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,760
phrases from the classics of Marxism, and not only Marxism, but there are inspirational

70
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,660
socialists who refer to thinkers going much farther back.

71
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,880
And here you have phrases like the world of the associated producers and the working

72
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,860
class in power and the commonwealth of toil.

73
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,900
One can go on and on, you know, with these wonderful inspirational phrases from the past,

74
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,060
and the kind of socialism that I, and I gather many of the people who have participated in

75
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:29,500
your symposium series, is interested in, is going beyond that.

76
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,420
In other words, we need to not just talk in general terms about the working class in power,

77
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,700
or to use a phrase from the manifesto where Marx and Engels speak about the condition

78
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,380
for the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all, you know,

79
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,140
this kind of language, which is wonderful, but it clearly needs to be transcended.

80
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,860
We need to put some meat on those bones, so to speak.

81
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,940
And finally, you have speculative socialism, you know, speculative utopian, where just

82
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,820
like the kind of thing that Marx was so concerned to transcend in the early part of the 19th

83
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:20,140
century, where there were all these writers, some of them very brilliant, putting forward

84
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,740
completely arbitrary idealist visions of how things would work and telling everybody

85
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,860
things will be done this way, and you will have this kind of institution and that kind

86
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
of institution.

87
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,260
And Marx wanted to get away from that totally.

88
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,300
So what's left?

89
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:42,060
What's left is what I call systemic socialism, which is somewhere in a middle ground between

90
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:49,180
simply saying we want to strive for equality and so forth, the thing, the values that socialists

91
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:59,660
uphold on one side versus a kind of utopian or speculative arbitrary engineering of institutions,

92
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,820
which Marx was quite clear.

93
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,700
And I think most of his followers have gone along, gone on from that.

94
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,860
You simply can't preordain, you can't write what Marx called recipes for the cook shops

95
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
of the future.

96
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,140
It just doesn't work.

97
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,460
You have to see socialism as something that grows organically within the existing society

98
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,780
and partakes of all of that history and sort of concentrates that history.

99
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,660
So it's in that framework that I would talk about democratic coordination, democratic

100
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,780
economic planning.

101
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:46,420
And yes, like as with my colleagues, Pat Devine, Robin Hanell, Al Campbell, Cockshot and Cottrell,

102
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,060
Alan Cottrell and a new contributor who works with them, Dave Zechariah and many others

103
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,260
who don't write in English.

104
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,540
And for that, I apologize.

105
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,660
I do read some Spanish and some Russian, but not enough to really say that I can

106
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,060
represent the people who write in those languages.

107
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,500
And the truly international discussion that we need is still in front of us.

108
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,500
We haven't yet achieved that.

109
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,940
And I'm as much to blame as anyone for that.

110
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,020
But anyway, we're all talking about democratic economic planning and trying to figure out

111
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,020
what that could possibly mean.

112
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:32,020
So that's a sort of a preamble that gets us to the doorstep of the question we need to pursue.

113
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,420
And apart from the way that you approach it specifically within your model, is there

114
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,100
some kind of definition of democratic economic planning that you could provide?

115
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,140
Well, I think the definition emerges in each of the separate models.

116
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,420
And I'll have something to say about that, because what I've tried to do in a recent paper,

117
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,180
the subtitle of which is A Model of the Models, clearly the subtitle implies what I'm trying to

118
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,580
do is look at the way the various models are related to each other and to understand whether

119
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,500
some kind of synthesis might be possible.

120
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,900
When I know you have a separate agenda, we'll talk about the science and society special issue.

121
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,260
And here I'm tempted to hold it up and show everybody, but I realize there's no visual here.

122
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,700
We're on audio only.

123
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,540
But it just came out.

124
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:32,660
We have the special issue of science and society, which is the fourth special issue,

125
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:44,020
which have been issued at 10-year intervals in the 02 years, in 1992, 2002, 2012, and now 2022.

126
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,020
You know, at specific 10-year intervals, kind of why it worked out that way, but it didn't.

127
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,420
And on the re-envisioning of socialism or envisioning of socialism and

128
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,780
what struck me about the work in those issues, it made a real attempt to bring everybody in

129
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,500
we brought in proponents of market socialism, which is the idea that,

130
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,900
first of all, very important contribution markets and socialism are separable.

131
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,060
They're not the markets and capitalism.

132
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,900
Sorry, I misspoke.

133
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,420
Markets and capitalism are separate.

134
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,460
They're not the same thing.

135
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,660
And that you can combine the advantages of markets with the advantages of socialism into

136
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,100
something called market social.

137
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,220
It's not my view, but it is one of the views that we sought to represent and various views

138
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,300
of economic planning and democratic economic planning on the other side.

139
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,580
Put them in a whole big circle.

140
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,180
My perception of this from 1992 forward as we did this work was that

141
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,660
people were talking past each other to some extent.

142
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,980
We were saying something in one of the special issues.

143
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,900
And then those of us who repeated and participated in the next special issue

144
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,340
were saying the same things again.

145
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,180
But that to use a very favorite socialist economic term convergence, convergence was

146
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,140
not occurring.

147
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,460
In other words, we didn't seem to be getting closer together.

148
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,260
We didn't seem to be moving forward in that sense.

149
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,900
And part of my recent work is an effort to overcome that or an effort, at least to address

150
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:28,340
it, to address the problem of synthesis, convergence, transcendence, moving on to another stage.

151
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,820
So that if we have another special issue in another 10 years, I won't be around to see

152
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,380
it, but it'll be, you might.

153
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,740
It won't look the same as the one that came before, the one that came before that.

154
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,820
It will have moved forward.

155
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,620
Of course, a lot depends on the world moving forward and the progressive and working class

156
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,300
movements of the world moving forward and taking these things to heart.

157
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,020
And that is something that I cannot directly influence, but can hope for.

158
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Anyway, I like also to take it a little further.

159
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,780
I like also to distinguish between different stages of socialism.

160
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,540
And here lies a major confusion in my view that is very present in many of our minds

161
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,540
we fall into it, we mix these things up.

162
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,340
We forget whether we're talking about stages of historical development.

163
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,620
And if we're talking about that, then we definitely mean

164
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,180
looking at actual historical societies in all their complexity, where you have the

165
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,420
coexistence of different social forms.

166
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,900
You have the coexistence of state administratively

167
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,020
organized production, production directly under political control and managed by a

168
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,460
bureaucracy of some kind that's carrying out the coordination functions and the

169
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,220
control functions.

170
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,620
And those bureaucracies have existed for thousands of years.

171
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,900
You might just as well call some of the dynasties of ancient China

172
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,300
socialists because they were very large and sometimes very efficient.

173
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,180
Surprisingly, so if you look into that history, systems of coordination with legal structures,

174
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,020
which the Chinese ancient philosophers were concerned to elaborate.

175
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,220
And of course, they've existed in the modern world in recent centuries and they continue to exist.

176
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,700
So you take a country like China, for example, which has a large and important state sector,

177
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,500
but that state sector also has state-owned enterprises, SOEs,

178
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,300
which are often managed and run on a small scale.

179
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,700
They're managed locally, but they exist as state-owned enterprises.

180
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,260
And in the midst of that, you have capitalist enterprises competing with them.

181
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,300
As we know, there's been some resurgence of actual capitalist relations in China, plus

182
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:14,100
cooperatives, plus the international capitalist sector in special zones, where some regulations

183
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,780
apply to them and so forth and so on.

184
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,580
In other words, you have a huge mix of systems.

185
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:26,340
You have a mixed economy, to use a phrase from the Western political economy literature.

186
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,180
And if socialist relations are, to the extent that social relations are dominant there,

187
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,500
you might call it a socialist mixed economy.

188
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,780
In fact, that's what the Chinese Communist Party basically puts forward as its view of themselves,

189
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:48,260
the market economy, with Chinese market socialism, with Chinese characteristics,

190
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,580
you know the phraseology that they use.

191
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,780
And from my point of view, that is all on one side.

192
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:04,820
What the model, the MDIC model, as you named it, multi-level democratic iterative coordination,

193
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,060
is about is not that.

194
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,460
It's not about combination of different things in historical admixture

195
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,300
with all of the contradictions and complexities that accompany that.

196
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,800
Not that.

197
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:26,340
It's a model of the way core institutions in the modern socialist economy interact with one another

198
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,260
and mutually determine each other.

199
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,500
That is the central idea, what we'll be talking about in a little while.

200
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,100
That's the main thing I want to get to.

201
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:45,380
The point, just to finish this up, about the stages, confusion that exists,

202
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:54,980
is that it has overtaken huge sectors, not just of the mainstream capitalist intellectual environment

203
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,220
where these people talk about mixed economies and institutions from here and there,

204
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:09,140
and the eclectic picture, transforming the complexity of the real world that they

205
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:16,100
observe into their theory directly with no organization, with no intervention on the part

206
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,060
of logic.

207
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,340
So you have the Cubans, for example.

208
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,620
They have their regular party congresses.

209
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,820
And obviously, discussion is going on all the time there, not just at the party congresses,

210
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,540
but it becomes very prominent at those periods when they wrestle with the question of what they

211
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,340
call reform.

212
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,660
The question is exactly the same as the Chinese question.

213
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,900
It's how can we mix socialism, I'm putting inverted commas, quotation marks around the word

214
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,860
socialism here, which means state production, state central planning, etc.

215
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:58,020
How can we mix that with just the right amount of, now quotation marks again, capitalism,

216
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,460
so that we get the advantages of capitalism, a spur to incentive, competition, dynamism.

217
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,020
That's what capitalism gives us, whereas the state sector gives us what we like from socialism,

218
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:21,460
security, equality, coordination, addressing the ecological problems which are always at the

219
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,780
forefront of our minds, those kinds of things.

220
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,980
How can we, so they're not talking about socialism, and I'm talking about the fundamental

221
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,500
levels of the Cuban leadership and of the Chinese leadership.

222
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,060
They're talking about a socialist capitalist mixed economy, the advantages of both.

223
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,660
And if you read their literature, that's very much the way the thinking goes.

224
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,220
Now, the implication of that is there's a one way highway with strong central planning,

225
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,580
state control at one end of the spectrum, and total deregulation market processes,

226
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,780
atomistic competition and so forth at the other end of the spectrum.

227
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,220
That's your spectrum.

228
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,420
And what we need is a mixed economy somewhere in the middle.

229
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,460
In some ways, it's not too different from the Keynesian conception within mainstream economics.

230
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,060
The mix of private and with the appropriate degree of state intervention or state intervention with

231
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,940
the appropriate mix of market competition in order to spice it up a little bit.

232
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,380
I think that's totally wrong.

233
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:34,100
I think MDIC and the other models that people have put forward is on a different dimension.

234
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:41,460
It's what the word, I'll just say perpendicular to, it's often in a different direction.

235
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,340
It's not that at all.

236
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,100
So if people say, and friends of mine in Cuba have said this, we need reform.

237
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,980
I say, well, reform in which direction?

238
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,020
In which direction are you going to reform?

239
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,820
And so multi-level democratic iterative coordination, if I can use my term,

240
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,260
the way I put it together, other people have different terms, of course,

241
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,900
is not somewhere on the spectrum between the market and central planning.

242
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,460
It's something completely different from it.

243
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:20,660
And that's the essential idea that I want to try to get across.

244
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,500
Yes, great.

245
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:30,260
And I mean, I can only highlight that we absolutely need an alternative because I mean,

246
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:36,820
it's not only, as you referenced, someone like Keynes who posits this as if there was only

247
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,020
hierarchical central planning or absolute atomistic market forces.

248
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:49,140
It's also Hayek who famously used this dichotomy as if it was only this or that.

249
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,540
And then we definitely have to transcend it.

250
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,860
And so I'm very happy to talk about exactly that with you today.

251
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,220
So let's get to your model.

252
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,060
Could you maybe as a start, give us a broad overview of multi-level

253
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,220
democratic iterative coordination?

254
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,660
What's the basic structure?

255
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,540
What are the basic assumptions and premises of your model?

256
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,980
Oh, when you take the concept of democratic planning, just take those two words.

257
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,260
An average person is going to scratch their head.

258
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,700
They're going to say, what in the world can you possibly be talking about?

259
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,220
Planning is creating something according to a single consistent vision.

260
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,780
When a painter plans a painting, he doesn't consult a whole roomful of people and say,

261
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,060
well, should I put a tree here?

262
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,900
Should I put a house there or a stream there?

263
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,860
The conception has to be kind of integral.

264
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,300
It's kind of almost inherently coordinated.

265
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,460
That's in the concept of planning.

266
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:57,060
Democracy, on the other hand, is a multitude of individual wills pulling in different directions.

267
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,660
Now, if you're not going to coordinate that with a market or with elections in the

268
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,420
political sphere, we'll just decide by having votes.

269
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,580
If you're not going to coordinate that way, how are you going to combine planning and democracy?

270
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,260
If people are involved in planning, they're going to say, well, someone's going to say,

271
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,300
I think we should do this.

272
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
And someone else is going to say, I think we should do that.

273
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,740
Well, what if this and that don't work, don't fit together?

274
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,580
Someone else is going to have to figure out a way to reconcile them.

275
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:38,740
It might take the form of a compromise or something is going to have to happen.

276
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,780
Anything you want to say about the constraints so that nobody's vital interests are threatened, sure.

277
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,660
We can obviously bring that on board.

278
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,380
But you still have a conflict.

279
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,860
This is the binary.

280
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,900
You referred to it before, the idea, and it's present in Hayek and the libertarian

281
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,220
thinkers at one end of the spectrum, plus the mixed economy people.

282
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,420
Everyone is worried about this.

283
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,580
But you never get away from that single dimension.

284
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,580
You never get away from that single idea that somehow we're going to have to

285
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,860
find some kind of a muddled up compromise in the middle if you want that.

286
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,940
If you're Hayek, you want to stay at one end.

287
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,460
But that's clear.

288
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,020
How are you going to do this?

289
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:31,620
The answer that emerged from the experience of first attempt socialist construction

290
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,420
in the 20th century is the iterative concept.

291
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,980
So I can start with that in answer to your question.

292
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,900
It was a central aspect of multi-level democratic iterative coordination.

293
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,900
The idea is really very simple.

294
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,220
The center, I'm going to speak of the center and the enterprise.

295
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,940
I'm going to speak of, first of all, I'm going to speak of two levels.

296
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,380
The model says multi-level, and that implies there could be more than two, which we could

297
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:09,460
analyze later, but I'll work with a simple conception of two levels, top and bottom,

298
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,580
center, and I don't want to say periphery.

299
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,260
That brings in another level of thinking.

300
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:31,300
The center essentially defines a brand plan for one of its enterprises, for all of its

301
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,900
enterprises, but we'll talk about a particular one, which is the basic nature of the enterprise,

302
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,660
the basic nature of its function, the kind of goods or services that it delivers

303
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,860
to the society as a whole.

304
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,940
And it says, this is what we see as your baseline.

305
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:58,500
Essentially, this is a point at which my model says the enterprise is not autonomous.

306
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:07,060
Now, there's an idea out there, which is another one of these unanalyzed terms that

307
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:13,300
people sometimes use a lot, self-management, and a lot of pro-socialist and socialist advocacy

308
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,020
people speak about self-management, and what we have to have is a lot of self-management.

309
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,980
If you analyze self-management, you have to ask, what does that mean?

310
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,860
Who is the self?

311
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,860
And of course, the self is a hierarchy of levels.

312
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,100
At one level, the self is a single individual.

313
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,500
At another level, the self is the society as a whole, but who speaks for the society as a whole?

314
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,220
And there are many intermediate levels.

315
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,780
There are sort of like non-governmental organizations.

316
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,620
There are stakeholders at middle levels of that process.

317
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,060
Some of the people you've been talking to and are continuing to talk to talk about

318
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,100
stakeholders a lot and stakeholder democracy.

319
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,600
Good.

320
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,420
So there are all these levels.

321
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,700
The enterprise belongs to society as a whole.

322
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,060
Society as a whole consists essentially, let's assume, of its working people.

323
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,660
It is the working class in power.

324
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,040
Okay.

325
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:16,740
We'll assume that remnants of the billionaire class are no longer a significant social force.

326
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,240
They're gone.

327
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,100
So everyone is working people, but with all differentiations within us,

328
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,420
different kinds of work and different levels.

329
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,180
But that's the overall social control of the enterprise.

330
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,140
So the first starting point is the enterprise can't simply

331
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,060
sell its assets and move to another country or change fields completely,

332
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,140
change from being in manufacturing production and move over to

333
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,220
services or agriculture or something else.

334
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,140
The enterprise has a defined role and it has certain

335
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,740
properties that have been devolved upon.

336
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,220
It means a production that are under its control

337
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,060
and which it is responsible to society for the management of.

338
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:12,820
So I guess the first point is the production units of our MDIC socialist economy are not

339
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:21,540
autonomous entities existing without any connection to the rest of themselves,

340
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,380
the rest of the economy.

341
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,540
And so that's the first level of control.

342
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,700
Now, from that point onward, the enterprises are responsible for determining their plan.

343
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:42,420
They're responsible for figuring out for the forthcoming period what they're going to do.

344
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,380
And this is the importance of the planning phase as well as the execution phase.

345
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:58,580
Planning in highly authoritarian systems like the capitalist one,

346
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,420
people say, don't worry about planning, it's the results that matter.

347
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,500
It even works its way into the epistemology of the economic theorists, positivism.

348
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,940
We're interested in results, don't worry about planning.

349
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,820
Planning sort of takes place in the head of the entrepreneur

350
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,780
and is kind of a fleeting moment that we can hardly analyze.

351
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:30,420
But a socialist conception sees planning and execution as two interrelated phases.

352
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,340
They aren't separate in time, although in early phases of 20th century planning often they were.

353
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,260
But the planning and execution are simultaneous but never merged into one another.

354
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,340
They flow into one another, but they have distinct qualities.

355
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,300
So you have a central body which essentially at the beginning of

356
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,140
what I'll call the planning phase of this process says, okay, get started.

357
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,300
And the key thing is that the enterprise is responsible for figuring that out.

358
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,500
The enterprise has to figure out what it will produce, the quantity of output that it's going

359
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,940
to target, the assortment of that output, the quality of the output, the measures of quality,

360
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:21,460
the intended, a rough idea of the intended recipients of the output, where the demand

361
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,380
will come from, how the output will be distributed to either other producers or final

362
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,180
stores for distribution to consumers.

363
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,420
The enterprise will have to figure out its technology plan.

364
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,780
It'll have to figure out what resources it wants to devote to technical progress.

365
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,060
It'll have to make organizational goals and set them.

366
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,580
It'll have to do all these things.

367
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,740
And then that will require a lot of interactions with the rest of the economy

368
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,900
because there's a great deal of division of labor.

369
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,540
And therefore there will have to be exchange in the raw sense that goods will have to move

370
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,180
from one producing unit to another, goods and resources of all different kinds,

371
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,700
including human resources, will have to be shared out and allocated and coordinated.

372
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:23,860
So the enterprise, when it produces its plan, has all sorts of implicit demands upon the rest

373
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,660
of society, raw materials that it needs, our sources, et cetera, et cetera.

374
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:37,460
And in the next round of this iterative process, the center has to take all that and say,

375
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,900
does it fit or doesn't it fit?

376
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,100
And you can think of this momentarily in a very simple supply and demand way,

377
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
which is an element of the whole picture.

378
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,220
It isn't the whole picture, but it is an element.

379
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,180
Is the total amount of a certain grade of steel

380
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,060
that is being demanded by all the enterprises for the work that they intend to carry out

381
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,340
equal to the amount of steel that the steel industry is slated to produce?

382
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,020
Has slated itself to produce.

383
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,300
And if those two numbers don't match, then you have a coordination problem.

384
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,740
And so we'll try to solve that problem by allocating additional resources to steel,

385
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:29,380
by finding workarounds, or by scaling back the production plans of the other enterprises.

386
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:36,180
And so it's a vast interconnected network that has to be rendered consistent.

387
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,060
Now you can render it consistent in the abstract by solving a system of equations.

388
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,940
There are millions of equations.

389
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,500
And then we get into the old millions of equations critique of socialism.

390
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,340
It's really a critique of central planet.

391
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,740
The central planners just don't have the information

392
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,660
and they don't have the technology to do it.

393
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,140
They can't.

394
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,500
It's too big.

395
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,980
And so we have to let the market do it.

396
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,020
That's the old binary.

397
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,340
That's the old way of thinking.

398
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,940
In the iterative way of thinking, the center sends modified plans back to the enterprise

399
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,780
based upon the enterprise's original plans, but with certain modifications.

400
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,100
Now the center's right to make those modifications is part of the conception.

401
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,860
The enterprise, as I said, is not an autonomous, self-managing entity

402
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,740
apart from any constraints.

403
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,780
And it's an old philosophical debate.

404
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,060
Does freedom boil down entirely to absence of constraint?

405
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,900
And Marx and Engels wrote about this, Engels particularly,

406
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:54,260
in an essay which was called On Authority and several other things that one could look at.

407
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,300
That's really important.

408
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,500
So the enterprise now has a modified plan, but along the lines of its original plan

409
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,820
because it signals its intentions by sending that plan up.

410
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,820
And so now, not having to start from fresh, from scratch,

411
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,060
the enterprise can make the necessary modifications and send the information back up.

412
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,780
Now in sending information up that way in each round or each iteration,

413
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,180
it's a crucial concept in the whole model.

414
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:34,980
So in each iteration, the enterprise sends information up to the top.

415
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,060
The enterprise is revealing its actual potentials, its actual capacities to do things.

416
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,780
And it is using its local knowledge.

417
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,100
So here again, we get a concept from Hayek, right?

418
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,740
And Hayek used the idea of local knowledge

419
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,300
as a way of attacking the very concept of central planning.

420
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:09,380
But the iterative conception is a stage by stage coordination of local wills and general wills.

421
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,220
You know, the general interest of society is expressed in the central plan.

422
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,700
That's a crucial idea in this.

423
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,140
That's a crucial idea in this.

424
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,700
And in principle, and I emphasize in principle,

425
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,900
because there's where the reply from the libertarians could come.

426
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,100
You know, what you can do in principle, you can't do in practice.

427
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,820
But I'll say it.

428
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,020
I'll say it in principle.

429
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,700
If the enterprise is incentivized to do it, if the enterprise has the incentive,

430
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,140
it can put its local resources and its local knowledge unknown to the center,

431
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:51,460
its particularities into the process and therefore send back to the center

432
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:59,540
in the form of its next round of proposals precise, accurate, detailed knowledge,

433
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,780
not only of what exists at the local level,

434
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,060
but what the local level thinks could potentially exist if it mobilizes its resources,

435
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,260
if it mobilizes its collectives and sets itself an ambitious project

436
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,020
for technical transformation.

437
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,100
And then that goes back to the center.

438
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,820
So the center keeps on getting corrected, better information.

439
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,660
And on the basis of that, better information puts together

440
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,300
one more iteration of a consistent plan and sends that back down.

441
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,460
And the enterprise can then work with that.

442
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:44,660
If each iteration results in a plan that's less different from the preceding one

443
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,420
than the time before, so that the plan is progressively getting,

444
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,420
in other words, what the enterprise gets back is more like what it said the last time.

445
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,340
And the same at the level of the center.

446
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,860
The center is constantly getting back from all the enterprises

447
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,500
a picture which is closer and closer to consistency.

448
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,860
Then the plan is said to be converging.

449
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,940
And that's where the word convergence comes in.

450
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,540
And work is being done and has done, it was done in the 20th century,

451
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:26,100
mainly in the socialist countries, the countries where this was a practical matter,

452
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:32,420
not just something that a few academics like me batted around, you know,

453
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,340
but they were really working on this.

454
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,300
The idea is how long will convergence take

455
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,860
and how efficient can the convergence process be?

456
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,540
So that if eventually you get convergence,

457
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,460
what you get is a plan which is not merely a political compromise,

458
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,260
as it's sometimes thought of in a mixed economy kind of a situation,

459
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,340
but something that everyone will have been involved in producing.

460
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,100
And there you have the potential to draw workers into the production process.

461
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:13,140
In other words, you have people being drawn into planning, conceiving

462
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:24,580
what our work is going to accomplish, you know, and jobs become not just jobs, you know.

463
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:33,300
You get to a situation where qualitatively, the workplace experience is not just an experience

464
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,860
of being an instrument of someone else's will for a period of time during the day,

465
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:45,060
in exchange for which you receive wages, creating a separation between a production sphere

466
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,700
and a consumption sphere, they're totally separate, you know,

467
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,780
but you gradually get the meaningful integration of this.

468
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,940
And that's a goal. Now, if you want to talk about something socialism is supposed to mean,

469
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,940
it's supposed to mean that. It's supposed to mean that people actually begin to experience

470
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,260
practically control over their own lives and theoretically in the sense that they're not just

471
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:17,060
carrying out orders and so forth and fitting into a scheme of things,

472
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:23,460
and fitting into a scheme of things, which everyone has to do. I mean, that's necessary

473
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,100
if the whole system is going to work, but that they understand the way the scheme works

474
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:36,100
and participate in making it happen. And I'll just say that my way of interpreting the great

475
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,460
legacy of Marx and Engels, you know, and their followers, everyone else who has come along

476
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,620
since then, is that they created a view of socialism, which was not that it's something

477
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:57,460
that strikes in one moment in time, like a bolt from heaven. You know, socialism is not a

478
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:08,180
miraculous occurrence, a kind of biblical event, but it's something that has to be built. You want

479
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:13,780
to talk about the working class in power. You have to have people with sufficient education,

480
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:21,860
sufficient political consciousness, sufficient fundamental human resources, people and their

481
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:29,460
institutions. Okay. And so that's part of it. We'll get more in a moment into the actual

482
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:37,940
organization of MDIC. Yeah. And we will definitely get also to the point that you just touched upon

483
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,820
at the end, which would be somehow related to the question of transition and transformation,

484
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:50,660
but we will kind of push it a little bit further to the end. Before we get there. I mean, there was

485
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:57,620
a lot in there when you just described the basic outline of the model. And I would have a couple

486
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:04,420
of questions actually that might serve as a follow-up. And I mean, one of the initial

487
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,140
questions would be the starting point where you said, all right, we have this center, which will

488
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:17,620
come up with a like first idea of a basic plan, which will, as you just pointed out, not be a

489
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:25,940
detailed plan because the detailed planning will be what the enterprises are going to do. But what

490
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:34,500
will be the basis of the, you spoke of a grand plan that the center provides in the first place?

491
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:42,100
So what are the components that this plan is based upon? And yeah, maybe let's just leave it

492
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:50,020
there. What's the basic starting point when it comes to that? Okay. It boils down to what is

493
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:59,780
the center there for? What is the role of the center? And every question is a big question,

494
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:09,620
but that's a big question. I'll try to be as brief as possible. The first point is we want to avoid

495
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:19,700
another conceptual miscue that is often present in people's thinking about this. People associate

496
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,540
democracy with the lower levels, the local levels. If you have people participating in planning,

497
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:31,220
they're participating at their enterprise, at their workplace, for example. They're not

498
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:36,980
participating over there. I would like to emphasize that what I'm calling the center

499
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:46,500
is also a site for democratic participation. And I mean this in two different ways. Now,

500
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,780
first of all, we have to be clear. If we're talking about a society with several hundred million

501
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:58,420
people, a huge country, I mean, countries are different sizes or at least dozens of millions

502
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:06,500
of people in a country of a reasonable size. We can't talk about everybody cramming into a

503
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:13,940
room and participating in the decision by raising their hands and exercising a democratic voice in

504
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:21,140
that direct democracy sense. We can't imagine a town meeting democracy on the level of a modern

505
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,220
country. And no one is trying to do that. So government will be representative.

506
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,060
And how representation is secured, whether by vote, whether by lottery,

507
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,180
there is a proposal for doing it by lottery. I don't follow that line of thinking myself.

508
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,340
I'm not convinced about that, but it's part of the debate, and it should be,

509
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,940
is another question that would have to be worked out. But you have

510
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:01,780
a system of democratic control in sort of formal sense. But I'm talking about more than that. I'm

511
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:09,780
talking about a culture of critical democracy surrounding central planning. Now, modern

512
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:16,660
technology plays a role in that. We have the internet. A central planning board doesn't have

513
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:22,340
to be a distant place. It doesn't have to be somewhere far away in a capital city, which is

514
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:29,300
thousands of miles from where I live, let's say, and where people do things that I have no control over.

515
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,060
Needless to say, in the 20th century, in the socialist economies of the 20th century,

516
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:43,860
there were quite a few instances of situations like that. It was a highly mixed

517
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:53,780
sort of situation. But it's a process, just as I said before, in relation to

518
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:00,660
worker participation. These things are processes, but it's also a process, the participation of the

519
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:08,100
worker citizen in central planning, at the level of central planning, where a certain degree of

520
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,940
openness of the process itself. In other words, the evolving plan doesn't have to be something,

521
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,620
let's say, a certain stage of the central plan moving toward consistency along the path of

522
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,900
convergence. You have a central plan. You don't have to wait until it's announced.

523
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,260
You can read it on the internet. You can go on the central planning website

524
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,380
and you can see what it is. And then there will be enormous critical commentary on that.

525
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,060
I like to say we're talking about central planning within the sites of the bloggers

526
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:53,060
and the cartoonists and the critical process in society as a whole. This would be part of the

527
00:44:53,060 --> 00:45:00,260
culture of central as well as de-central levels of planning so that

528
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,380
quality has got to be part of our deliberations. Now, that having been said, what does the

529
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:17,540
central planning do? Because I think what your question actually was, well, first of all, it

530
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:26,260
achieves overall coordination, but that's just part of it. Beyond that, it organizes

531
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:35,380
the discussion of planning as such. Now, you'll notice that I use the term

532
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:40,660
multi-level democratic iterative coordination. I used the word coordination at the end of that

533
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:48,020
little acronym, MDIC. I didn't call it multi-level democratic iterative planning,

534
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:55,700
and I had a reason for that. I think the word planning has a connotation that ought to be

535
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:03,620
preserved. It's planning for the future. It's forward-looking planning, and that is not just

536
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:09,700
the problem of how do we put the puzzle together now, but how do we think about the way we

537
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:17,620
want our society and eventually our societies, think of a global level, to evolve in the decades

538
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:25,940
to come? Foremost there is the question of sustainability, the question of how do we want

539
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:38,500
to evolve human activity in a way that enhances and protects the Earth's environment and the ultimate

540
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:47,380
constraint, the limitation of planetary resources available to us. I won't talk about

541
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,980
Star Trek and the Federation of Planets or anything. That's science fiction or speculative

542
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,660
fiction, so we'll leave that for the future, but right now we're talking about planet Earth and

543
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:06,660
its limited resources and so forth. A view to the future, a long time horizon, is very central to

544
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,100
what a central planning element within the overall planning process, not central planning,

545
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:20,980
but the central component within a dynamic iterative process. That is something that

546
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:26,740
the central planning component can contribute, a sense of the long time horizon, of the need to

547
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,940
protect the Earth from global warming and the need to protect the ozone layer. I can go on,

548
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:41,380
but there's a huge literature on this and this aspect is very important. Those constraints

549
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,220
involve studying the interaction among the activities of all of the economies and all

550
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,860
of the local units of all of the economies together. In principle, this cannot be done

551
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,580
at the local level. This is something that can't be, obviously people everywhere can have opinions

552
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,700
on it and should have those opinions expressed and the critical deliberative process should be

553
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:10,660
taking place. There's no question about that, but this is something that can only be worked into

554
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:17,460
meaningful long-term plans, dynamic future-oriented plans at a level which coordinates,

555
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:24,820
has a coordinating perspective for the overall, so that's one thing, major thing, that central

556
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:31,780
planning can do. There's also something that's very hard, we need to do a lot of background

557
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,100
on this and I'd need to do a lot of background for myself because I'm teaching it to myself

558
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:44,740
over the years, but I want to say something very controversial about prices. There is a

559
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:51,780
widespread idea that we can develop some kind of optimal prices, the best prices,

560
00:48:52,180 --> 00:49:00,580
but that if we do, what we will be doing is imitating what exists in a general equilibrium

561
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:08,420
of competitive markets, that the market model is the model for what the price vector, that is

562
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:14,900
the list of all the prices, ordered list in the economy, what that should look like, what the

563
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:20,740
should look like, what the internal proportions in that list will be, is somehow

564
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:32,260
planning something that is what a spontaneous market mechanism with either socialist or

565
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:40,100
capitalist property relations regardless, a market mechanism unplanned would accomplish

566
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:46,980
and I think that's wrong. I think there are socialist production prices, if you like,

567
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,700
I call them social reproduction prices and work that I've done on this,

568
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,700
which would incorporate

569
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:07,460
actual quantitative calculations of price relations that are determined by social

570
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,420
relations forces, things going on in the social relations of society, such as, for example,

571
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:22,500
the ecological considerations, which no spontaneous mechanism involving interaction among

572
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:30,660
uncoordinated entities, resulting in convergence towards some kind of equilibrium prices

573
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:37,380
can possibly accomplish, it just can't do it. So one of the things a central planning board

574
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:44,420
would be responsible for is the massive problem of calculating optimal prices for purposes of

575
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:51,540
prices for purposes of calculation, income formation, decision making,

576
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,740
and I'm taking the point of view and it's a controversial point of view in the socialist

577
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,660
spectrum and some people say all of that is capitalist thinking, you shouldn't be thinking

578
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:06,740
that way at all, that you shouldn't be thinking about, first of all, you shouldn't be thinking

579
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,900
about optimality, you shouldn't be thinking about finding the best ways of doing anything

580
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:18,340
that's foreign to socialist thinking, I don't believe that, I believe

581
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,860
optimization in that sense is too important to be left to capitalist property owners,

582
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:32,340
when the workers own the resources of society and are in charge of its legacy, are in charge of

583
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:39,060
what we become, you know, that responsibility weighs heavily on the shoulders of people who

584
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:45,940
have to actually make decisions and carry it out and they have to do it the best way that can be

585
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,020
done in the name of all the people whose blood sweat and tears are congealed in all of those

586
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:57,300
resources that we have, you know, and the futures and whose children and grandchildren depend upon

587
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:06,100
upon that and that's a very important element of socialist leadership. So it's another thing that

588
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:11,620
a central planning board would have to do. So finally, I'll just end with a very short one,

589
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:20,580
a central planning board has got to address taking into account the entire background

590
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:28,180
democratic debate and all the information that's flowing into them all of the more near-term issues

591
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,460
about how society should develop, how should we arrange the relationship between production

592
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,660
and residential spaces? You know, it's an old question, but clearly an obviously relevant one

593
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:47,620
will continue to be, should we put factories and homes close together, save on commuting time,

594
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:56,340
you know, but there are obvious environmental pollution issues, you know, should people have

595
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:03,060
to live near sources of environmental pollution, noise pollution, environmental pollution, you know,

596
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:11,300
particulates in the air, anything like that, you know, or should we separate production locations

597
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:16,420
and residences, put them miles apart from one another, you know, then we can create nice

598
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:22,500
residential enclaves which don't have to see the factories and the stores and the offices, you know,

599
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:30,100
but we create enormous commuting problems, burdens on the transportation network. How do we work out

600
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:38,660
consumption, production, residence, transportation, how do we get all these networks,

601
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,980
water, power, you know, obviously the technology is improving and the trade-offs are getting better,

602
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:52,580
you know, over time, unless ecological problems, you know, tightening environmental constraints

603
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,220
are working in the opposite direction, but all of this has to be put together and it has to be

604
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:04,180
thought through and has to be eventually transmitted into viable five-year, ten-year,

605
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:11,540
fifteen-year, thirty-year plans, you know, which reflect the formation of a democratic consensus,

606
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,820
they reflect the best that technology can give us and they reflect the overall balance of resources

607
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:24,180
and these are problems that can't be solved at a local level. The local level participates in them,

608
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:31,380
but the local level can't, you can't have 10 million separate plans to address

609
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,180
the problem of human interaction with the environment over the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years,

610
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:43,140
can't happen. That's the central component and some of the things which it has to do.

611
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:53,460
Let's try to pick this apart a little bit at least because oftentimes when, also when reading

612
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,820
a text and now when hearing your elaborations, I mostly agree with the overall sentiment,

613
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:04,820
but there are like huge question marks in terms of how can this be done? So, when it comes to

614
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:12,900
the question of what kind of information would the center need to have in order to be able to

615
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:19,220
make these decisions that you think the center should do and which I would largely agree with

616
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:25,860
that this would be a problem of collective problem solving and not only a domestic one

617
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:32,820
because certain topics cannot be addressed as you clearly pointed out on a decentralized level alone,

618
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:40,500
but what is the flow of information? So, I need to come back to this question. If you state that

619
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,940
the center, for example, will have to calculate, I think they are called price lists, which include

620
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:55,940
social reproduction prices for broad categories of goods as I understand it, then what would be

621
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:03,220
the informational basis on top of which this would be calculated and you also explained that it would

622
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:09,460
not only be a parametric part which needs to be considered, but also a very social one that needs

623
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:15,860
to be considered and it needs to flow into these forms of calculation done by the center, but I

624
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:22,740
think it is of crucial importance first to ask, okay, what's the information, the exact information

625
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:31,300
that flows into it? If you do not have, for example, prices for consumer goods or something

626
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:39,860
like that that will serve as an indicator, for example, and then how would a meaningful

627
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:50,340
participation of the enterprises as well as the rest of society, how can this be facilitated in

628
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:58,100
order to not end up in a situation where the people that receive these quote unquote directions

629
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:06,580
from the center do not perceive it as external to themselves, but do like legitimately feel it

630
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:12,420
as something that they took part in creating. I mean, this is a very crucial element and I think

631
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:20,420
it's something that you are very much interested in that people will be able to participate in this

632
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:28,820
forming of plans, but you will have this kind of difficult question to answer how it can be done

633
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:35,380
that it is not like too many meetings problem, as you just stated, it's not possible to have like

634
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:43,140
20 million people deciding on this, but still have people left with a reasonable

635
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:53,300
way to take part in this overall coordination. So how do you approach this kind of difficult problem,

636
00:57:53,300 --> 00:58:02,260
I guess? Well, I think you're asking me a question which can only be answered

637
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:08,180
historically, it can only be answered by the process of history unfolding itself. I think

638
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:14,660
you're asking the kind of the working question, which isn't going to have a simple answer with

639
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:25,620
the capital A, it's to an ordinary, we always use this word ordinary, but a rank and file

640
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,980
socialist and socially conscious and socialist educated working person

641
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:38,900
in an enterprise, a price list is announced and is available on the internet,

642
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:52,020
which is a very big now in price theory, you discover and there was a lot of work done

643
00:58:52,580 --> 00:59:01,700
in the Soviet Union and other eastern countries about this. If the price list is a sort of a core

644
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:11,300
than an enterprise can apply for variations based upon detailed things. My general point is that

645
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:18,180
the person working in an enterprise can say, okay, these are the prices we have to work with,

646
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:24,340
we just take them, we take them parametrically, we just say these are the prices and we don't

647
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,220
need to be concerned with how they were constructed, but they don't have to do that,

648
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:38,020
they can understand the theory behind it, they can understand something. Now, there's obviously

649
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:45,300
on different levels, I'm not necessarily assuming that every worker in a production

650
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:53,700
plant at an enterprise is going to be able to independently solve the matrix equations,

651
00:59:53,700 --> 01:00:01,220
which result in the formation of a certain set of optimal prices, but they will have come up

652
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:09,780
through the education system and the ongoing education system, the process of political and

653
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:16,660
political economic education that's part of being in a socialist enterprise, it's part of existence

654
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:24,180
in that enterprise, they will acquire some sense of the underlying principles and they will know

655
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:31,540
something about that and they will have read the equivalent of popular science articles,

656
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:41,540
which explain and transmit as much of this. One of the goals in this integration of planning and

657
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:53,300
execution as two phases of human activity, really, is to break down those barriers, to

658
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,820
to create the greatest possibility for rational understanding,

659
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,860
as the sociologist Mannheim, Karl Mannheim, would have said years ago,

660
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:13,300
rational understanding rather than merely functional understanding. Now,

661
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:17,300
we have functional understanding of a lot of things, I personally have only functional

662
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,820
understanding of this computer that I'm talking to you on and what you do to move around on it,

663
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:31,940
I wish I were more of a techie, but I'm not, and we struggle with that, but in all fair

664
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:37,060
phases of life, we want to understand and especially when it comes not to the technical

665
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:42,740
things, where we understand that better, but when it comes to the social side, when it comes to

666
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:49,540
actually knowing how human relations are managed and that we're part of that,

667
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:56,740
you know, we aren't just recipients of it, we have a role to play in grasping it

668
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,740
theoretically, not just practically. But beyond that, it's hard to say,

669
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,420
you know, it would depend on and it will be very different in different places and times,

670
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:13,300
you know, different, I don't think there's a simple formula that can answer that one,

671
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:20,260
it has to be answered practically. And I mean, quite a huge part of this relation,

672
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:27,380
specifically when it comes to enterprises and the center, is the question of,

673
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:35,380
I think you posed it as the question of incentives before, I mean, because at some point,

674
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,100
the question comes into mind that you have this iterative process and the center sends some

675
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:48,100
initial prices for broad categories and then you have the detailed planning by the enterprises

676
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:55,540
and the enterprises then are expected to submit truthful information. So, I mean, as we know,

677
01:02:55,540 --> 01:03:00,820
this was a problem in the Soviet Union, so this was not truthful information because we had the

678
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:08,900
perverse incentive problem, so to speak, where the enterprises did have a incentive to kind of

679
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:15,860
hoard stuff because they knew that they would get like way too hard goals to manage and so they

680
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:22,500
were hoarding, et cetera, et cetera. So, you will have in this iterative process, the question of

681
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,620
what's the incentive for the enterprises to give back truthful information in order to make the

682
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,820
whole thing work because if they do not, then it kind of implodes, so to speak, because it won't

683
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:39,060
work and related to that is the question of what will be the reward for the given enterprise.

684
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:48,100
So, I think there's a, I think you call it, let me take a look, socialist rate of return

685
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:54,180
and as far as I understood it, this would be a kind of rate at which

686
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:01,300
enterprises would be allowed to profit, quote unquote, from the whole thing. Maybe I got that

687
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:09,860
wrong, but I would be interested in this constellation. How do the given enterprises,

688
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:20,660
how are they incentivized to do as they are told, quote unquote, plus being semi-autonomous in

689
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:30,740
being effective in actually producing the stuff and not wasting resources and then truthfully

690
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:37,540
reporting back and taking part in the iterative process? So, what's the gist to all of that?

691
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,660
Because it needs to be a collaboration and not an opposition.

692
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:48,260
Well, wow. These are questions which could take a long time to answer and I want to try to...

693
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:54,020
But they're central, I guess. I mean, for me, it's absolutely central to understand the model.

694
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,580
I'm sorry if it's too...

695
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:04,740
One thing, no, don't be sorry. Very good. One thing, I'll break it into two parts. I'm trying

696
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:09,860
to figure out which part to do first. I'm going to do the reverse order. I want to take the

697
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:17,700
incentive. That's part of your question, which is very good. So, you have this iterative process

698
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,340
and we're somehow assuming that the enterprise is going to get together and is going to make

699
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:30,260
truthful reports of the resources it controls and is not going to manipulate the process for

700
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:35,300
its own strategic purposes. I think that's key and there was a huge literature in the Soviet Union

701
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:41,620
about deformations that resulted from exactly that kind of behavior, which is exactly what you'd

702
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:49,700
expect at the stage of development that existed there. Then you'd hardly, from a serious materialist

703
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:55,620
point of view, expect anything else to happen. You had people... How did Marx put it? He says,

704
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:01,460
society only come into existence stamped with the birthmarks of the society from which they emerge.

705
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:12,100
This is a process. We understand that. So, how do we address strategic distorting behavior on the

706
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:21,700
part of local entities, enterprises or whatever? First, I want to mention there's a whole literature

707
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:30,420
on that, which I believe was in some ways stimulated by the economic reform in the

708
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:37,300
Soviet Union. Back in the 1960s, the Lieberman reforms, as they're called in the West, which

709
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:43,540
essentially amounted to setting up something like at least an early stage of an iterative process

710
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:52,100
that MDIC focuses on, where the enterprises were told, we will no longer be sending you detailed

711
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:58,580
plans. We will be sending you a few overall control figures. Within that, you need to work out

712
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:05,300
the detailed plans. You need to do a complete accounting for your resources and

713
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:11,860
a specification of how you're going to change methods of production and what you're going to

714
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:18,740
do. Was that successful or unsuccessful? It's a long, complicated story. I want to skip over it,

715
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:29,860
but it gave rise to the incentive design literature, which a number of European scholars...

716
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,820
There was a large French component, an economist by the name of Tirol,

717
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:44,820
and a number of Americans also participated in that. How can you devise truth-telling

718
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:57,220
incentive mechanisms? Essentially, I have an answer. I'm not going to try to

719
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,260
elaborate it too much, because we don't even have visuals. We only have sound,

720
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:07,940
and even to the extent that I understand it, which is that I've been able to take it.

721
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:18,420
I think in the usual thinking about this, there's another binary, another one of these

722
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:24,420
either-or kind of situations. In this case, the either-or is that people say,

723
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:33,540
some mathematical economists say, either you assume that people are socially motivated and

724
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:44,740
have high moral values and will simply act in the public interest because that's the kind of people

725
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:50,660
they are. You assume glorious people out of whom you will build a glorious society, or you have

726
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:58,900
to give up. Those are the two alternatives. The only kind of incentives you can possibly

727
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:03,700
have that make sense are market incentives where people are actually made to suffer for bad

728
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:09,700
decisions. If we don't produce efficiently, the business will go out of existence and the workers

729
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:17,060
will be fired and so forth and so on. That's control. You can't do it anyway. You can't provide

730
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:23,540
people with an incentive to act in the social interest. You don't have to provide them with

731
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:30,180
an incentive to act in their personal interest. That's human nature. They'll do that by themselves.

732
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:37,940
Is there an answer to that? I believe there is, and it resides in something I call,

733
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:43,860
that's a complicated phrase, but I'll give it to you because then I'll be able to refer to it.

734
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:53,940
The collective morale function. Let me set an environment to explain this. There's an enterprise

735
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:01,860
and the enterprise is required to form a plan. The enterprise personnel sit around a table,

736
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:06,260
the enterprise director and some of his technical people and some other people,

737
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:10,420
representatives of each of the departments of the enterprise, some kind of a little group that,

738
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:18,900
as best as possible under now given circumstances, represents the enterprise. What should we do?

739
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:25,700
The enterprise, I'll just use a term, say the enterprise director

740
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,940
has a problem. Let's say he's in charge of this meeting. He sets the agenda.

741
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:49,220
He or she can set a target and say, this is what we're going to achieve. I'll put a number on it,

742
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:55,940
a target of 100. We're going to set a target of 100. The question is, is that the best the enterprise

743
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:03,460
can do? In order to find that out, this director is going to have to consult the people in the

744
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,980
enterprise. He's going to have to say, okay, people, do you want to roll up your sleeves

745
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:13,460
and really get to work? Do we want to really make a run at transforming ourselves into something a

746
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:19,940
little bit different from what we've been and really improve the way we work? This can mean

747
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:25,540
the level of output. It can mean many other things as well. I'll get to that part. That's

748
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:32,500
the second part. Are we really going to do this? Are we going to push ourselves to the practical

749
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:44,340
limit? If we do, then let's say that's 100. Now, if we do a little less than that, it's 95, 96.

750
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:50,180
If we do more, it's 103, 104, 105, that kind of thing. That's an index number

751
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:58,900
that we can use to measure our level of performance. Now, here's the collective

752
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:06,820
morale function. It says that when you have an enterprise in a society that is technologically

753
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:14,660
and educationally and socialistically advanced, we have a society of very intelligent, committed,

754
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:21,780
working people. We are not talking about people who trudge unwillingly into work every morning

755
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:27,300
and do what they're told, take a list from their supervisor, pay you to do this, this, and this,

756
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:34,180
and you carry out those tasks, go home, buy groceries with your wages, and come back the

757
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:41,220
next day. We're beyond that. We have a society where in order to achieve something, you really

758
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:48,260
have to have people motivated to do it. People really have to be involved. You have to bring

759
01:12:48,260 --> 01:13:01,060
your teams on board, so to speak. Now, suppose the enterprise director is a very ambitious person

760
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:06,420
and wants to make a real good impression on his or her superiors,

761
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:15,780
and says, the information coming from all my colleagues is that our best level of achievement

762
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:27,060
is 100. I'm going to push for 103. Let's see if we can get it up to 103. This is the kind of person

763
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:36,260
who's really a rouser, a very, very high taught planning kind of a person, a person who is going

764
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:44,820
to try to push the enterprise. Let's suppose the actual effect of that has a demoralizing component

765
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:51,940
to it. Let's suppose people are going to sigh and say, okay, well, I guess we can put in some overtime

766
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:56,420
and I guess we can rework all these procedures that we have and I guess we can recalculate

767
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:03,220
everything. We can go over everything, but it's really impinging on other areas of life

768
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:08,740
for your staff, for the people around you. It's tough. This is not an easy thing to do.

769
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:15,700
What the collective morale function says is that as a result of pushing beyond 100

770
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:23,060
and calling for 103, what you'll only get is 102. In other words, you'll get people to do a little

771
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:31,300
more, but various forms of conscious and even unconscious resistance will develop.

772
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:38,420
What you will get, I need you to imagine a sort of a line. I realize I can't put anything on a

773
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:47,460
chalkboard. A horizontal line at a level of 100 and then a curve which touches that line at 100.

774
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:53,140
It's below the line. It touches at 100 and falls off in either direction. It's like a

775
01:14:53,140 --> 01:15:02,100
downward-facing parabola. It just rises to 100 at a certain point at 100 and then falls off.

776
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:11,220
You see? If you push too far in the upward direction, you will get an increase,

777
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:18,740
but you won't get the increase you push for. Similarly, and this is where the other side is,

778
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:23,940
suppose you get an enterprise director who wants to game the system and wants to go for less than

779
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:32,740
100. This is the concealing reserves case, which was talked about in the old Soviet literature,

780
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:41,460
where an enterprise director would have an incentive to try to achieve a plan which is

781
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:49,620
less than 100. In the iterative MDIC context, he would want to announce a plan less than 100

782
01:15:49,620 --> 01:16:00,980
and wants to announce a plan of 97, let's say. Once again, what's going to happen is that

783
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:07,220
that is also going to be demoralizing because people are saying, this enterprise director

784
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:15,620
is not asking us to do what we really can do, as much as we really can do. This enterprise director

785
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:22,420
is asking us to do less than that. Maybe we'll take a cue from that and we'll just cut back a

786
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:34,100
little bit more. Instead of 97, you would get 96. Again, part of the collective morale function.

787
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:39,940
In other words, the central idea is that under modern conditions,

788
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:55,380
moral matters. For morale to be invoked, for a collective to achieve a certain high level of

789
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:04,500
functioning in its own terms, it has to know that it's doing the best it can do. But the best

790
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:09,380
doesn't mean the most. It doesn't mean the farthest out along that line, as we can possibly go. What

791
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:18,900
we need to do is we need to get it... In other words, the point of a collective morale function,

792
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:26,100
if it exists, is that the actual need to motivate your collective, the actual need to put people

793
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:33,780
into motion, to make things happen well, and to get people to reveal their own reserves and to

794
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:41,700
come forward with suggestions and interventions and activities. The way to accomplish that is

795
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:51,380
to be truthful. And if you're not truthful, the forces around you will undermine you

796
01:17:53,060 --> 01:18:02,180
to some degree. Now that idea, if it's true, if I can justify it,

797
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:08,260
and if anybody ever pays any attention to it, there will be many attacks against it,

798
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:15,380
it'll be contested. And in a certain sense, from my point of view, it should be, because if it isn't

799
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:27,140
solid, it won't hold, is the essential guarantee of the MDIC system. In other words, the center

800
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:33,860
can count on the enterprise to do approximately the best it can and therefore to send good

801
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:42,020
information up and enhance its contribution to the overall planning process. Because if it doesn't do

802
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:52,020
that, its own moral energy will be sacked, its own moral energy will be undermined.

803
01:18:52,020 --> 01:19:03,300
And to the extent that that's true, it's not, many people may interpret this as

804
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:12,260
saying that you're relying on the goodwill or the high moral fiber of individuals,

805
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:19,860
the way the old critique of decentralized planning had it. But I don't think that's what I'm doing.

806
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:25,460
I hope that's not what I'm doing. I hope what I'm saying is that the enterprise, which means the

807
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,220
people themselves, I speak of the director, but he's speaking for everybody knows this,

808
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:35,700
everybody sitting around that table knows what the situation is. If we don't work ourselves to

809
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:41,780
our reasonable best level, and if we don't participate in the planning process in a

810
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:50,180
principled way, not in a strategic undermining way, then we're not going to feel good about

811
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,540
ourselves. And if we don't feel good about ourselves, we won't do the work that we need

812
01:19:53,540 --> 01:20:00,980
to do. We will be undermining our own work. Here it is in a single folksy expression,

813
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:06,900
the last thing I'll say, okay, get another question from you. If it's worth doing,

814
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:14,420
it's worth doing well. And you hear workers say that. There are even writers who talk about the

815
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:21,940
invisible heart. That term has been used in a number of different ways. But my point is that

816
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:29,140
the ultimate blue, which holds so-called market system together, is that there's an underlying

817
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:36,900
moral foundation to incentives, which can't be gotten away from. And I'm relying on it here as

818
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:49,060
well. Well, I mean, I would say it's based on a lot of assumptions for sure. But it's based on

819
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:55,220
assumptions that I personally kind of favor, I would say, because at the end, it's not about

820
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:04,580
like relatively dumb economic incentivation, which I always think of not really holding up.

821
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:13,860
Because if I look at myself, for example, I always found being forced to earn money for living

822
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:21,060
is like one of the biggest obstacles for me in trying to pursue things that I'm good at,

823
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:27,780
actually. So I personally like this approach, that it's not so much about economic incentives.

824
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:34,820
I'm not so sure about the morality part, to be honest. But I think it refers back to

825
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:46,740
the question of how autonomous the enterprises are actually, how autonomous they can feel in terms of

826
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:52,180
the, I have to use the phrase, self-management of the enterprise. I mean, at the beginning of

827
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:59,860
our conversation, you refer to it as something that is not a given within your model. And I

828
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:06,900
would say we do come back to this right now, because it's part of the question of incentivation

829
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:16,660
that is not based on economic incentivation. How much do I legitimately feel involved in the way

830
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:24,740
the given enterprise is being run on the level of the enterprise? And then how much do I legitimately

831
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:35,780
feel being involved in the overall plan that gives me the like broad categories, broad directions of

832
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:43,140
what I am supposed to do. So I would say that given this constellation that you just described,

833
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:51,540
the question of, at least the perception of some form of autonomy within the workplace

834
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:59,460
comes back into the picture as a form of motivation. So this is something that I might add at this

835
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:06,100
point. And then I wanted to ask something, because I, when trying to picture your model,

836
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:15,940
never really got to the point of understanding it correctly because I will just say it as directly

837
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:26,180
as I can, but is there profit? Does a given enterprise have the possibility to, for example,

838
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:34,260
pay a higher remuneration depending on how good they have done their job? I'll be as stupidly

839
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:41,620
obvious and blunt about it as I can. Is there something, it doesn't have to be like money,

840
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:48,420
it can also be like more leisure time or anything as such. Because if there would be something like

841
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:54,500
that, some form of indirect economic incentive, then it would really, really, really alter the

842
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,980
whole picture, I would say. And it would also alter the picture in terms of if there is some

843
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:07,860
form of competition between the enterprises. So this would introduce a very different level

844
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:13,300
to the whole thing. So maybe you can help me kind of get a better picture of the whole thing.

845
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:21,620
Wow, we're covering everything in one session. This is amazing. We have to have a whole course.

846
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:29,700
It's good. I don't know whether I could, even this question, I'm trying, I didn't take notes,

847
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:35,780
I'm trying to remember everything. But yeah, okay. One aspect of your question is the,

848
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:45,940
you speak of profit. Now, let's assume for our discussion that we don't mean capitalist profit,

849
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,740
we don't mean surplus value extracted, you know, anything like that. But we're talking

850
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:58,580
about a socialist enterprise. The enterprise is owned by the workers of the country as a whole,

851
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:05,060
let's say. But it's also the workers who are actually at the enterprise and participate in

852
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:12,340
it have a major role, you know, and their interests have to be represented. One aspect of

853
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:24,100
your question is differentiation of income. Should people be rewarded for more product or for better

854
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:29,460
work? You know, should people be rewarded? So we can boil that down to saying,

855
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:35,780
start by asking the larger question, should the enterprise be rewarded? Should there be a stream

856
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:41,140
of income to the enterprise? We can even call it profit as long as we understand that the word

857
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:46,180
profit is one of those tricky words that means different things in different contexts. We know

858
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:54,500
that. So we'll just use it. Should the enterprise receive a profit based upon an evaluation of its

859
01:25:54,500 --> 01:26:00,980
work? So first of all, the question is, how do you evaluate enterprise performance? How do you measure

860
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:08,100
it? How do you measure how well or how poorly an enterprise is doing? And the second question is,

861
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:16,020
once we have that thing, once we have that reward, I mean, sorry, let me start this sentence again,

862
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:21,940
once we have that measure of enterprise performance, so I can say of this particular

863
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:27,140
enterprise, and it can say of itself, well, we did this well, or not so well, or whatever,

864
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:33,300
you know, whatever level it is. Now based on that, and the reward we receive as a result,

865
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:40,340
how should that reward be differentiated and broken up into the rewards of individual members

866
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:46,340
of the enterprise? How should it be reflected in individual wages? And how should those,

867
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:54,740
what I'll use the standard term for them, material incentives be harmonized with or related to

868
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:02,180
moral incentives, the kinds of incentives that are given in the form of collective appreciation,

869
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:11,940
you know, trophies, banners, but not in a simplistic, cynical sense, but things that might

870
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:18,660
could at least be meaningful, they could at least have meaning for people. So come back to

871
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:26,020
the first question, how do we measure what an enterprise does? In the old days, earliest

872
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:30,900
experiments in socialist planning, of course, it was simple, the more the better. You know,

873
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:37,220
how did you measure the output of the work of a steel mill? How much steel it produced,

874
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:43,540
you know, millions of tons of steel, that was the measure, you know, and any other industry

875
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:51,220
the same way. Clearly, that's not sufficient. You have to measure not only what is being done,

876
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:56,340
but how efficiently it's being done, whether targets are being met for variety of output

877
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:02,900
and for quality of output, many different things. All of that boils down into a single measure,

878
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:09,940
a rate of return. Okay. Now, it's not a rate of return in a sense of a property income to

879
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:16,020
ownership of the means of production. The society as a whole indivisibly owns the means of production.

880
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:22,420
This is not a market socialist model. The enterprise does not own its own means of production.

881
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:26,980
But we're talking about a rate of return in a sense that enables us to evaluate how well

882
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:33,620
are the resources entrusted to us being used? And that's important, as I said before, you know,

883
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:38,740
that's something that socialists need to be concerned with. And you need to convince

884
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:45,540
the workers that we will, that we presume to lead in political struggles and eventually

885
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:52,180
revolutionary struggles, you know, that we will do that. You know, people understand that.

886
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:56,900
People say, we don't want clowns running the society who don't care about the resources that

887
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:05,460
represent generations of our effort and our collective labor, you know, to have created

888
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:10,820
these things. We want these things to be well managed. And that means being concerned with

889
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:25,220
rates of return. So what kind of rate of return? Well, not the capitalist one. Capitalist rate of

890
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:32,580
return is profits divided by capital. Right? Socialist rate of return, and this is an argument

891
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:37,220
I'm taking from a whole literature around what used to be called full income prices,

892
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:40,820
is not profit, but the entire net income.

893
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:48,340
In other words, wages plus profit divided by the value of means of production.

894
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:56,500
I won't use the word capital in this context. So that in standard macroeconomic notation,

895
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:02,420
it would be Y over K, not P over K. It's not profit divided by K as a symbol for the means

896
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:09,460
of production, for the value of that, the resources being deployed to create this result.

897
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:15,860
But the entire income, the wages, in other words, what in conventional capitalist accounting are

898
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:24,900
wages and profits, all of that is returns to us as a whole, whether individually or collectively,

899
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:31,060
doesn't matter. So that's one thing about what rate of return do we use. And that rate of return,

900
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:37,380
if you analyze it, think about it, has all sorts of efficiencies taken care of within it. It's like

901
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:44,740
an aggregation of attending to levels of productivity, saving of raw materials,

902
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:50,260
efficient technical changes, which use the capital stocks in the most efficient way,

903
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:56,340
never mind what the details of that. But all of those kinds of decisions,

904
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,140
if taken properly, would result in a higher rate of return.

905
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:06,900
So that's one. Let me just very quickly, then I'll get back, continue with another question.

906
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:14,260
The other half of it is that in a socialist context, the measure of enterprise performance

907
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:21,940
can very well have a whole additional component to it, something totally different. And this would

908
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:30,580
be a component that's based upon ratings of the enterprise by stakeholders. And here I'm adopting

909
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:37,060
some of the thinking of Pat Devine, whom you've interviewed, you've had him present his ideas

910
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:43,380
directly. But I think that's a contribution to this. Stakeholders, which can be the workers

911
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:50,820
in the enterprise, but they can also be the surrounding community of the enterprise. They

912
01:31:50,820 --> 01:32:04,260
can be people who are interested in and qualified to examine the enterprise's work in relation to

913
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:09,860
ecology goals, sustainability and so forth, and emissions and so forth.

914
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:16,420
Industry representatives, people who vote essentially on how well the enterprise

915
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:21,780
relates to other enterprises in the industry. Soviet Union, for example, they used to have

916
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:28,020
programs where an advanced enterprise would take a lagging enterprise under its wing

917
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:36,500
and form mentorship relationships, where they would work on the technical skills of the workers

918
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:42,500
in the lagging enterprise and try to eliminate deficiencies. And finally, very importantly,

919
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:47,700
I would say, this is a socialist society and we're interested in building a solidary and

920
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:55,140
working class. We're interested in overcoming all existing vestiges of racism, misogyny,

921
01:32:56,020 --> 01:33:04,820
exclusive nationalism, nationalisms, all of these perverse ideologies that keep us from

922
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:09,140
unifying fully and developing our potential. How well is the enterprise addressing that?

923
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:14,580
How well is the enterprise addressing gender relations within the plant and helping to

924
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:22,420
address problems there and advance equality in that sense?

925
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:32,340
And all of those things, those various evaluations would be supplied to a component of the formula.

926
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:36,980
In other words, it would just be good things to do, but this would be how you actually

927
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:42,580
put it right into the formula, which determines the measure of enterprise

928
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:47,300
performance, which in turn determines the reward that the enterprise receives.

929
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:55,700
Okay, so there would be the possibility of a reward in terms of

930
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:08,180
money, so to speak, depending on basic performance and social indicators, I think you call that.

931
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:12,420
Not money as such, but money as representing real income, real purchasing power,

932
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:19,220
a material incentive. Yeah, but there is money in your model, isn't it?

933
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:28,580
Well, yes, in the sense that it's implicit, it's being assumed. I don't build equations involving

934
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:37,140
a quantity of money. I don't worry about the velocity of circulation or issues in monetary

935
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:47,300
theory, but yes, I am assuming that for a reasonable period of time in an early stage

936
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:58,180
of development of mature socialism or MDIC socialism, some form of monetary unit would

937
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:04,660
be used as monetary units were used in the planned economies of Eastern Europe and the

938
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:12,500
Soviet Union, or we could speak of the currencies in place in capitalist countries since today.

939
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,420
Here, there's a lot of confusion on the left. I think a lot of people on the left go immediately

940
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:23,780
to a very utopian view. We should abolish money. I think what you want to abolish is what social

941
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:29,140
relations get carried in monetary form in a capitalist society, and not necessarily even

942
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:35,860
abolish those, but eliminate them as the possibility arises. It's one thing to say,

943
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:42,020
we're going to abolish something. It is stroke. It's another thing to say, we've reached a level

944
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:47,700
of development where this can now be attenuated or these aspects of money can wither away.

945
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:53,140
But Marx was very clear on this. He said, money is one of the last forms of coercion.

946
01:35:54,100 --> 01:36:00,340
You know, and in order to eliminate it, development through a lower phase of communism

947
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:10,500
is necessary before that ultimate coercion of human beings by other human beings in the sense

948
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:16,180
of their circumstances surrounding them, like a monetary constraint on consumption, the connection

949
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:24,340
between labor and income. You know, you can say, let's just get rid of it right now. Let's just

950
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:30,260
throw it away. But if the foundations have not been laid for that, if the prerequisites have

951
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:36,580
not been established, the results could be disastrous. And we'll take you farther away

952
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:42,260
from the goal of reaching a society where those constraints on human activity, including labor,

953
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:49,700
would no longer be binding constraints, increasingly wither away, become attenuated.

954
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:58,820
We will get there, I guess, in more or less one of the last questions, which will be on transition.

955
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:04,420
But before that, I would very much be interested in your opinion on markets, because I think you

956
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:11,220
have a distinction or not, I think, but I know you have a distinction between a core sector

957
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:17,380
and something that you call, I think, the informal sector. And I never really got my head around

958
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:23,540
that. And it really reminded me of the, I think, the Chinese dual track system, the experiments

959
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:30,180
around that, because I had a very interesting guest on Isabella M. Weber, who wrote about how

960
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:38,900
China escaped shock therapy. And how they did it was through forms of cautious experimentation

961
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:44,420
with something they called the dual track system. And I felt very much reminded of these

962
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:51,380
experiments when I read about this distinction between a core sector and a sector that is

963
01:37:52,180 --> 01:38:01,460
forming around that within your model, which will, at least it sounded to me, Bill, will be

964
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:10,980
some form of mild market socialism-like sector. But I think you would disagree with that. But I

965
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:15,380
would certainly be interested in your opinion. Maybe you could explain to us what the core

966
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:19,380
sector is, and what the informal sector is, and how both relate to markets.

967
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:28,100
Okay. Well, the core sector is the MDIC economy, you know, multi-level democratic

968
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:38,820
iterative coordination. And it's not a market economy, you know. Prices are planned. Now they

969
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:44,740
may be planned with lots of local input, but they are eventually centrally planned. The central

970
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:56,020
component within MDIC is constantly forming and perfecting a system of prices which takes

971
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:05,780
regular account of the natural environment, the future, the actual social nature of the

972
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:15,940
productive resources which shape rates of return. It's hard to explain without presuming some

973
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:22,580
economics, you know, in the audience. And here we have no presumptions. We have a whole

974
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:29,780
varied audience of people listening. But the connection between profit rates and prices,

975
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:35,540
you know, and the whole price structure depends intimately upon that. And the idea that

976
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:42,340
a general rate of return needs to form, which also I believe is true of an MDIC economy. But

977
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:51,060
I'm digressing. Let me try to stick onto your question. That's the MDIC economy. It is not a

978
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:59,940
market economy. So it's not a model of market socialism. And neither is it simply a state

979
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:08,740
central planned economy. This is important because in the non-socialist literature and

980
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:15,620
anti-socialist literature, socialism and state enterprise are equated. They practically mean

981
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:20,100
the same thing, you know, that when you talk about socialism, what you mean is the government will

982
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:25,060
make all the decisions and will decide everything. And we're not talking about government. To have an

983
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:34,900
MDIC economy, it would have to be within what you could call the state sector. It is governmental,

984
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:42,340
but governmental itself does not define it. There would be plenty of state enterprises

985
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:46,980
that are not part of the multi-level democratic iterative coordination system. It's a real

986
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:59,460
discipline. You have to be part of an everlasting, always existing, a continual, a system of

987
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:04,660
iterative coordination, a system of up-down and not just talking to each other all the time,

988
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:13,940
but regular stages of perfection of plans, which are to be implemented in the near future,

989
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:19,460
just while you are already implementing the existing ones. Implementation and planning are

990
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:25,860
interrelated and continual processes. People are at different stages of both

991
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:39,860
at all times. That's the multi-level planning system, and it has a distinct and necessary

992
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:46,180
central component to it, unlike models like Robin Hanel's and Mike Albert's paracon,

993
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:53,620
participatory economy, which says the central has got to be excluded because it's the source of

994
01:41:55,620 --> 01:42:00,020
necessary, unavoidable evils, so we've got to have an entirely decentralized system.

995
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:07,380
There are many other variations on the model which could be described.

996
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:13,060
Now, the informal sector,

997
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:23,220
well, on the one hand, it doesn't really play a role in the model of the MDIC system. You can

998
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:29,540
form that model and you can think abstractly of a socialist economy which functions that way,

999
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:35,860
which functions as a multi-level democratic iterative coordination system. In the real world,

1000
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:45,380
well, every example of a society that we know of, from the Asian countries, China, Vietnam,

1001
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:52,660
to the Eastern European ones from earlier, they've gone in a different direction now,

1002
01:42:52,660 --> 01:43:01,220
now, temporarily, I hope, and the Soviet Union no longer exists. You have examples of societies,

1003
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:09,460
even the society, and Cuba, even the socialist economies that have existed in real historical

1004
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:22,100
situations, even the ones that have been the most pure, non-informal, have had huge informal sectors.

1005
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:28,020
The Soviet Union had the collective farm sector. It had a kind of an informal services

1006
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:31,460
sector because they always had difficulty integrating services into the planning

1007
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:40,500
mechanism, so people used their skills to fill in the vacuums. The Soviet economy,

1008
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:50,180
annoyingly, did not solve the problem of repair services for material goods that they were

1009
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:58,580
producing. You could buy a TV by the late 1950s, 60s, but you couldn't get it repaired,

1010
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:04,020
or most annoyingly, washing machine, so people with those skills, with the necessary skills,

1011
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:17,620
set themselves up as informal suppliers of these services, and that was part of their informal

1012
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:25,060
economy. There were others, as well, that one could go into, but of course, you're going to

1013
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:31,540
have that. That's going to be part of the real-life process. The crucial thing is that

1014
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:36,020
just because you're in the public sector doesn't mean you're in the core economy.

1015
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:44,180
I regard the public sector also, if it's a traditional public sector, as may have existed

1016
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:52,100
centuries earlier, or even millennia earlier, that doesn't make you socialist. It becomes socialist

1017
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:59,940
when the democratic planning process becomes established. That happens by stages. It doesn't

1018
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:12,740
happen all at once. This perfectly leads to the question of transition, because the whole

1019
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:22,020
model, as I understood it, as I read it, with all these elements that I sometimes intuitively

1020
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:28,100
would kind of tend to want to reject, but I absolutely understand that the whole model

1021
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:37,700
is formed around an idea of process, and that we need to actually keep in mind the imperfections

1022
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:46,100
and hybridity of actually existing conditions as we find them and as we are living within them.

1023
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:55,620
I would be interested, maybe you can just sketch this idea of a model as process or a model as

1024
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:02,580
transition, maybe, because this was really an interesting read for me when engaging with the

1025
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:09,380
model, maybe the tendency within me might be too strong to kind of skip a stage or something like

1026
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:14,980
that, and you would maybe argue if I would lay out my ideas in terms of, okay, there should not be

1027
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:21,540
any form of wage labor relation or any connection between labor and pay and stuff like that, and you

1028
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:29,860
would possibly answer me, well, Jan, this is not the world we're living in right now. You should

1029
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:37,060
keep in mind that people are socialized within these forms of relations, and we should consider

1030
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:43,220
that when developing our models, and I can absolutely see that you do consider this. So

1031
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:55,060
maybe to make it into a question, how would we go about this idea of transition, like in the sense

1032
01:46:55,060 --> 01:47:04,020
of how could we transition to a multi-level democratic iterative coordination, and how do

1033
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:09,940
you think about the transition within the model and the maturing within the model? Because this

1034
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:16,660
seemed to be something that is very much on all of the groundings that you think about,

1035
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:22,740
that there is a process of maturing and that we should keep this in mind. Maybe you could just

1036
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:28,500
give your thoughts on that, because I think it's really important, actually.

1037
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:40,500
Oh, well, okay. First of all, your speculative utopian projection of why do people have to

1038
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:46,180
receive wages at all is very good. It's very smart. We should never forget that. I think what you're

1039
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:54,980
doing with that is you're saying we can be in what Marx would have called the lower phase

1040
01:47:55,700 --> 01:48:02,020
of a communist society, and we could be dealing with the realities of that, and the fact that

1041
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:09,300
the higher phase cannot be just jumped into immediately. We can't immediately go to what

1042
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:17,780
we later on started to call full communism. Okay, let's assume that's true, but that doesn't

1043
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:23,860
mean we can't think about it and keep thinking about it constantly in our minds.

1044
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:32,100
If you were in a precursor stage of socialist development, let's suppose you had made

1045
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:41,860
significant progress at removing the capitalist class from its residual power, from its ability.

1046
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:47,940
It's lost the state in a political revolution, let's say, but we're in a kind of a very early

1047
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:56,900
socialist environment where capitalist principles out in the real world are still simmering below

1048
01:48:56,900 --> 01:49:06,740
the surface and could reemerge. We have a mixed economy, or China. We have a strong state sector.

1049
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:15,700
We have a socialist mandate at some level, at least socialist in the sense of an understood

1050
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:18,500
politically supplied central

1051
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:30,900
state enterprises providing some forms of stability and security for working people.

1052
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:39,460
But we also have a spontaneous market system, and we don't stamp it out. Our goal isn't to

1053
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:44,660
stamp that out any more than in the Soviet Union. They want to stamp out the television

1054
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:59,060
repair guy who plays a very important role. He fills a need, but of course that can obviously

1055
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:06,020
could have negative potentials for income distribution and stratification

1056
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:12,980
farther down the road. We keep an eye on it. There we have our informal economy.

1057
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:21,620
What we're trying to do is, through stages, gradually building up to the point where

1058
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:29,300
rather than allowing a private market sector to coalesce into a small capitalist sector and then

1059
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:38,340
a not so small capitalist sector, and recreate class divisions of the sort which could undermine

1060
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:45,460
the material base for our political project overall. It could overturn us. We don't want that,

1061
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:53,620
but we also understand that by trying to stamp them out at a stage before we have the kind of

1062
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:57,860
flexible and systematic and sophisticated planning mechanism,

1063
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:09,300
I'll use my term, MDIC kind, that could absorb them. What we want to do is we want to create

1064
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:17,300
the conditions where those kinds of spontaneous entities with their negative potentials

1065
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:24,900
increasingly can cease to exist because we have the opportunity to create alternatives to them.

1066
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:32,500
That means creating a really good, well-functioning, flexible MDIC system.

1067
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:40,100
One of the things that we can do politically is attempt to support that MDIC system

1068
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:48,900
in the context of a precursor economy, not now thinking about the MDIC model as being

1069
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:56,900
dominant, but thinking of it as just something we're attempting to start to build.

1070
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:02,340
There are many tricky problems here, most of which I assume I have never even thought through,

1071
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:05,700
or we haven't even begun to think about this stuff.

1072
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:16,660
You can't set up an MDIC system on a tiny little scale. You can't create a tiny little pilot

1073
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:23,860
project within a state sector. The state sector and its overall characteristics, it's got some

1074
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:35,140
stabilizing characteristics to it and probably even some economic advantages. It has

1075
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:42,020
economies of scale that you can draw upon for society as a whole, but it also creates

1076
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:47,780
huge bureaucracies which have their own little centers of power that begin to develop, and it

1077
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:57,140
creates bad politics internally within it. This is part of what we're dealing with, and I'd love

1078
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:04,900
to be able to say, well, we could just develop a tiny little socialist planning sector, democratic

1079
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:11,940
planning in this environment, and it would gradually grow. I came up with an idea a few

1080
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:16,980
years ago, totally controversial, and many people hate it, but that's okay,

1081
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:27,140
that you could actually have a bicameral legislature. Of course, the problem here

1082
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:32,740
is how would you get to a bicameral legislature if you didn't have the political will to achieve

1083
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:37,620
this? If you had the political will, you might not need it in the first place, so I'm not sure

1084
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:42,580
whether this really makes sense, but it's the way my mind is heading. You would have a popular

1085
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:47,700
assembly which would be elected by direct vote of the population. It would be a real,

1086
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:55,300
a democratically, talking about the electoral form, and you'd also have another house

1087
01:53:55,300 --> 01:54:07,380
of the parliament, which would be a core economy council, and to elect representatives to the core

1088
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:13,380
economy council, you have to work in a core economy enterprise. You have to be part of the core,

1089
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:22,660
so if you are a core economy council enterprise member, you vote for the core economy council,

1090
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:29,140
but you also vote as a citizen for the popular assembly. Other people who work in the private

1091
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:35,300
sector or also the informal economy just vote for the popular assembly.

1092
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:44,420
In a society where electoral traditions are very strong, if you're in Western Europe, the United

1093
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:50,260
States, in these kinds of society, some kind of a bicameral legislature of that kind, existing

1094
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:57,620
temporarily might be a useful way to go, because it provides an additional incentive

1095
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:05,780
so that we're an enterprise, and let's say we're privately owned, or maybe we're a state enterprise,

1096
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:14,260
but not part of the core economy, and we have meetings, and it can be pretty contentious

1097
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:21,220
meetings, it can be difficult meetings, at which certain people say, look, we should be part of the

1098
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:25,700
core economy, we should apply for membership in the core economy, we should become an enterprise

1099
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:32,660
that's part of this iterative planning, democratic iterative planning mechanism.

1100
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:42,180
Many advantages to it. Now, in addition to just the economic advantages of

1101
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:51,140
the resources that you have available, and you might have expertise of the central planning

1102
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:59,620
folks can come and work, be in residence with you, help you develop your computer systems,

1103
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:06,980
connect you to the intranets and internets that run the whole thing on the basis of

1104
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:15,460
internet doesn't run it, but it's a tool for running it, and participation in some of the

1105
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:20,500
deliberations and the meetings of sub bodies within the planning system, you have a lot of

1106
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:25,860
connections, but in addition, you can vote for the core economy council, you get to vote twice.

1107
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:29,860
It's just an idea, it's just an idea, I don't know.

1108
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:39,140
You could get into a low level equilibrium trap kind of a situation, you could get into a

1109
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:46,340
situation where the resources to push you past that threshold where the core economy

1110
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:52,100
begins to be able to become dominant simply by demonstrating its superiority,

1111
01:56:53,060 --> 01:57:00,820
by demonstrating its superiority as a mechanism for ensuring democracy, human development,

1112
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:10,020
the whole thing. So the core economy isn't quite strong enough to do that, and you have a private

1113
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:15,140
market sector with various divisions within it, you may have a cooperative sector, and you may

1114
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:20,100
have a state sector, which is not part of the core economy, but which exerts a strong political

1115
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:24,340
influence on the society, and people who operate within that, the mandarins,

1116
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:31,060
they like their power, they like being where they are, they also recognize that their power

1117
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:37,540
is constrained because of the existence of these other forces, it's kind of like a political

1118
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:42,980
stalemate, and how do you move beyond that stalemate and get to the point where the core economy can

1119
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:49,220
develop? But I'll finish by saying the core economy in principle should be able to pick up

1120
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:55,700
those informal sectors, it should be able to absorb them. There's no reason, for example,

1121
01:57:55,700 --> 01:58:02,340
why there can't be consumer good repair collectives that form and that are superior

1122
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:09,460
to individuals working by themselves and in ignorance of who their potential market is

1123
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:16,900
and where people can't find them, and I can give you plenty examples of where spontaneous

1124
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:24,900
market mechanisms produce non-optimal results, even in the narrowest terms of

1125
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:34,900
the most efficient way to accomplish some task, so you can do much better by forming collectives

1126
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:40,500
and operating as a non-core collective subject to rules, I mean there are going to be rules

1127
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:49,300
regarding wages, regarding health and safety, all of that is going to be there, and eventually

1128
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:58,660
applying for membership in the core economy, which you could obviously do, and there's no

1129
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:05,780
reason why the MDI system couldn't incorporate everything that we now think of as agriculture,

1130
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:12,420
services and so forth and so on. There's one more issue which I could talk about,

1131
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:16,420
but I won't, I'll stop, and that's entrepreneurial labor. What do we do

1132
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:20,580
about entrepreneurs and innovation? Maybe we'll do it another time.

1133
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:29,940
Well, I mean we already covered a lot of ground, and before we finish up, I just wanted to

1134
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:37,780
give you the possibility and also simply hear about it. I mean the science and society special

1135
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:43,060
issues on envisioning socialism, they have been such an important driver of the debate.

1136
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:49,380
Yes, I could see the new issue, nice, very nice. I mean the audience won't be able to see it, but

1137
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:56,980
it's out right now in April, so go and get it. I mean they have been such a huge

1138
01:59:57,140 --> 02:00:02,660
driver and important driver of the debate, and I mean not everybody will know about the project,

1139
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:08,420
so could you maybe explain what envisioning socialism is to our audience, and maybe also

1140
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:16,500
give an idea of what it meant to try to push this debate all over these, I mean now 30 years,

1141
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:22,900
and also specifically during a period which was termed the end of history, quote unquote.

1142
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:30,580
I mean the first issue came out in 1992. This was peak end of history, so yeah.

1143
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:38,500
Well, not too much I can say. People should go to the science and society website,

1144
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:46,580
which is just scienceandsocietyand.com, and there's a link for Guilford Press,

1145
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:51,540
which is our publisher, where you can order the issue or subscribe to the journal. I'd love to

1146
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:56,900
have you do that. First, I need to clarify some things. The journal, Science and Society,

1147
02:00:57,540 --> 02:01:04,580
does not necessarily endorse, people have different views on it, you know, obviously everyone

1148
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:10,980
at Science and Society thinks it's a worthwhile project, but there's a variety of different

1149
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:16,180
positions and takes on it, and among the participants in a particular issue, this is the

1150
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:22,580
fourth issue in the project that I'm personally looking at. I'm sorry I can't show it to

1151
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:34,100
the listeners to this podcast, but authors range from a major Chinese contributor, Enfu Cheng,

1152
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:40,340
Pat Devine, Robin Hanel, their names have been mentioned before as being people who have

1153
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:44,900
participated in previous Science and Society special issues, but a number of other, I won't

1154
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:51,140
name everybody who's here, the guest editors of this issue are Al Campbell and myself,

1155
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:58,580
and I also ought to emphasize that I do not speak for that group of people as a collective,

1156
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:05,540
there's a lot of different views, a lot of controversy on how to think about all of this,

1157
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:11,860
but the one thing I think most people would agree upon is that we do have to think about it,

1158
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:17,300
it's very, very crucial, and even those of us who are thinking about systematic socialism who go

1159
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:24,980
beyond the level that people for whom socialism is just human goodwill and eliminating the gross

1160
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:31,700
inequality and crises of contemporary societies, moving beyond that and moving to something that

1161
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:37,540
fulfills our human potential more than we have in the past, and who haven't gotten beyond that,

1162
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:43,460
who aren't ready to embrace any concept of systemic socialism of any kind,

1163
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:52,740
I think we play a very essential role for being an attractive potential for

1164
02:02:55,620 --> 02:03:00,900
a much wider community that could play a very significant political role and a necessary

1165
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:10,500
political role in the society of the present, so I urge everyone to be part of that conversation,

1166
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:16,020
whether through our journal or through all other media, including podcasts and

1167
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:20,020
Zoom conferences and everything else that we try to do.

1168
02:03:20,980 --> 02:03:28,260
Absolutely, so let's all get engaged with systemic socialism, or at least everybody who's interested,

1169
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:34,020
it's desperately needed. There's a last question that I ask all of my guests and that is,

1170
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:37,220
if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

1171
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:43,700
I'd have to say I'm just joyful about the possibilities.

1172
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:48,100
We're in a period of time when it's not always easy to be joyful.

1173
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:55,220
I won't go into details, everybody knows what's happening in the world and why.

1174
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:04,500
Our joy might be compressed a little bit by dwelling on that too much,

1175
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:10,580
but we have the ability, we have the potential to get beyond that, and

1176
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:19,220
even if you're not sure it's true or not, but you know that other people do think that it's true,

1177
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:25,860
that systemic socialism in some sense, socialism as more than just a set of shared values,

1178
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:32,580
which is important, but socialism in the sense of an actual alternative to the way things are done.

1179
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:38,180
One of the things that Al and I, the co-editors of the special issue

1180
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:47,540
of Science and Society, insisted on as part of this is that we simply have to get

1181
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:55,780
further. I won't say beyond, I'll say further than. The level of thinking which says,

1182
02:04:55,780 --> 02:05:00,340
why don't we just all treat ourselves well? Why don't we just apply the golden rule?

1183
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:08,980
If socialism is going to be a serious contender and is going to be the foundation for real

1184
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:15,700
oppositional politics in today's world, socialists are going to have to be able to answer the question,

1185
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:21,460
how would you do things differently? How would you actually make things work?

1186
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:27,220
And I think an awful lot of people, be honest with yourself, maybe you're in that category,

1187
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:32,100
will say we love the values that are, otherwise we wouldn't be listening to this podcast, you know,

1188
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:41,780
we love, you guys are, you have a good vision of humanity in place, but do you really know how to

1189
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:47,940
get things done? Can you really get things done the way the financial institutions and the

1190
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:53,940
stock markets and the corporate bureaucracies, you know, that run this world for a capitalist

1191
02:05:54,820 --> 02:06:02,340
entity that is in charge of it? Can you accomplish that, what they do, let alone do it better than

1192
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:08,340
they do it? And if you think honestly, you may say, well, I'm not sure I have an answer to that.

1193
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:12,020
Well, that's what we're looking for, we're looking for answers to those questions,

1194
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:17,460
and we won't find them all at once, we won't find some grand magnificent answer,

1195
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:24,980
which answers every aspect of every question, won't happen, it'll be by process, and people

1196
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:28,980
will be entering into that with partial solutions, which we can't even imagine what they are right

1197
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:36,340
now, we don't know, because that's the democratic part of the total picture, you know, we need those

1198
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:44,500
inputs, even though we don't yet know what they are, because they will help us to form continuing,

1199
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:51,460
not complete answers, but continuing answers to the questions of how we can get on with developing

1200
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:58,340
everything that human beings are capable of being. And that's, that's, in simple terms,

1201
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:04,820
what the project is all about. Awesome. David, thank you so much for taking the time and being

1202
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:08,900
part of future histories. All right. So long.
