0	6000	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and today's episode is a very special episode.
6000	15000	Not only is it the last one of the year 2020, but it also is a new Future Histories live episode.
15000	23000	This time, Mattia Paganelli invited me to hold a guest lecture at his seminar on computational arts
23000	28000	at the Goldsmiths College in London, which I of course happily accepted.
28000	36000	And since the guest lecture was three hours long, I proposed a format in which I would hold a short presentation
36000	46000	on podcasting as a form of extended research and then afterwards record an episode of Future Histories live in front of the students.
46000	54000	I'm absolutely thrilled that Benjamin Bratton agreed to be the interviewee for this Future Histories live episode.
54000	59000	I will introduce him at the beginning of the interview and so I will restrain myself to saying that
59000	64000	for me, Benjamin is one of the most interesting thinkers of our time.
64000	72000	His book, The Stack, is rich beyond belief and his work tries to bridge a gap that absolutely needs to be worked at
72000	80000	and that is the bridge between political theory and the techno-social realities and possibilities of our time.
80000	84000	My warmest thanks go out to Mattia for the invitation to hold the guest lecture,
84000	89000	to Benjamin for taking part in the interview and the discussion afterwards,
89000	94000	and to the students of the seminar on computational arts for their participation.
94000	99000	We talked quite a bit and so I split the interview into two parts,
99000	104000	of which you will hear the first one today and the second one in two weeks' time.
104000	111000	This will be in 2021, which leads me to wishing all of you a happy new year.
111000	120000	Thank you for your interest in Future Histories, your thoughts, mails, tweets, your suggestions for guests and topics.
120000	127000	I know 2020 has been shitty, but there are good things too and I thank you all for that.
127000	132000	But now, enjoy today's episode of Future Histories with the great Benjamin Bratton
132000	139000	on Synthetic Catalyxies, Platforms of Platforms and Red Futurism.
145000	147000	So, welcome to Future Histories.
147000	153000	My name is Jan Gro√ü and I am very excited to welcome Benjamin Bratton as a guest in today's episode.
153000	158000	Benjamin is Professor of Visual Arts and Director of the Center for Design and Geopolitics
158000	161000	at the University of California, San Diego,
161000	167000	as well as Program Director of the Terraforming Program at the Strelka Institute in Moscow.
167000	169000	Welcome, Benjamin.
169000	171000	Thank you very much for having me. Pleasure to be here.
171000	176000	There are multiple episodes of Future Histories that are, in one way or another,
176000	181000	concerned with the topic of cybernetic plant economies in the age of their technical feasibility.
181000	186000	You have talked and written about this topic and you introduced a term that might be helpful
186000	190000	to understand what we are dealing with, synthetic catalyxy.
190000	196000	What are synthetic catalyxies and what openings do they possibly provide?
196000	202000	So, yes, thank you for the invitation to speak with you.
202000	209000	This term, synthetic catalyxy, is probably a good place to start.
209000	215000	On this question of a planned economy versus an unplanned economy,
215000	223000	and maybe as a way of also perhaps beginning the conversation with some consideration of what we mean by a plan,
223000	229000	what we mean by unplanned, and maybe even what we mean by economy in this way.
230000	244000	So the term, the catalyxy originally, the reference that I'm drawing this from is in reference to the work of Hayek,
244000	256000	who uses this term catalyxy as part of his argument against socialist planned economies
256000	264000	and the mid-20th century model of a socialist planned economy, which we should be clear right away.
264000	270000	When we're thinking about what a planned economy might be for the 21st century,
270000	282000	the models of a planned economy from the mid-20th century may not necessarily be the model reference that we should be building on.
283000	291000	But suffice to say, for Hayek, he sees markets themselves,
291000	299000	and it should be maybe clear not necessarily capitalism as a whole, but markets, at least in theory,
299000	306000	as not only a space or a place by which supply and demand might meet each other,
306000	315000	but also as a kind of calculation machine, as a kind of collaborative calculation machine
315000	321000	that has capacities both for feats of tremendous abstraction,
321000	329000	but also for the sort of direct fulfillment of supply and demand in the simplest sense.
329000	336000	But the catalyxy then refers to this capacity of markets to be pricing mechanisms,
336000	347000	that markets find prices, that how much the bananas should cost or how many desks and chairs should be produced
347000	354000	is in essence calculated itself through the dynamics of the market.
355000	363000	And so it's an understanding of the market as a kind of, not just something about which computation might be interested
363000	371000	or something about which computation might be used to organize, but that the market itself has computational capacities,
371000	375000	that it is a kind of computational apparatus.
375000	382000	Now, as I'm sure you are quite aware because of all of the other, the discussions that you've kind of had,
382000	388000	he's proposing this in contradistinction to the classical socialist pricing problem,
388000	400000	which argues that no planned economy can possibly provide that calculative function that a market does
400000	407000	as quickly or as efficiently as the market can itself.
407000	413000	And you might imagine it sort of like if you have 10 people sitting in a room
413000	418000	and they want to have a conversation with each other and negotiate something,
418000	421000	like how should we rearrange the furniture in this room?
421000	427000	And in order for the furniture in the room to be reorganized,
427000	432000	all those 10 people would have to, let's say, write down their interest on a piece of paper
432000	435000	and then send it to the office across the street.
435000	437000	And then the office across the street will get all of these pieces of paper
437000	441000	and then send pieces of paper back to every one of these 10 people one by one.
441000	445000	And you imagine what this conversation would be like if every time anybody needed to say anything,
445000	450000	you have to send what you wanted to say across the street to an office who then makes this plan
450000	451000	and then sends it back to you.
451000	455000	You would say, well, it would be just simpler if we just let, we had the conversation ourselves.
455000	459000	So in any event, I'm not an Austrian, this isn't my approach,
459000	464000	but just to give a sense of what the idea comes from.
464000	470000	Now, one of the points that was made, and I'm sure you've raised this in some of your other podcasts,
470000	476000	even back in the 60s and 70s was that, well, fine,
476000	486000	but the capacity for computation and particular network computation,
486000	490000	artificial computation, not the natural, let's say the natural computation of the market,
490000	494000	but the artificial computation that when we think of computers and computer networks,
494000	502000	you know, silicon-based computation, to send and receive information from one point to another point,
502000	506000	they already sort of understood that this was increasingly fast
506000	512000	and again, sort of in the height of the Cold War, 60s and 70s here,
512000	518000	and the capacity of synthetic calculation through silicon-based computation
518000	522000	was also becoming increasingly fast.
522000	526000	And so this argument, and then even the metaphor that I'm using of the piece of paper
526000	530000	walking across the street and stuff, this kind of bureaucratic model of,
530000	534000	this particular kind of bureaucratic model of a planned economy,
534000	538000	was probably out of date to a great extent.
538000	544000	And that the scenario people would ask is like, okay, but what if you could,
544000	548000	what if those messages of interest that everyone had in that rearrangement of the furniture
548000	552000	could be said essentially instantaneously across the street,
552000	560000	that it could be mapped against a thousand different ideal models of furniture rearrangement
560000	562000	and then instantaneously sent back.
562000	568000	Would not this allow for actually an acceleration in the capacity for that conversation
568000	573000	and that negotiation to take place in such a way that this would work?
573000	583000	And that not only could artificial computation operate to produce things like pricing signals
583000	590000	and structure models that was equally fast to the kind of emergent processes of the market,
590000	598000	but perhaps even faster, and perhaps could draw upon models and again, best practices
599000	605000	and other kinds of things and goals and larger sort of macro programs
605000	611000	that would not be available to just a small group of people doing this negotiation.
611000	615000	And so this became, as you've all been discussing,
615000	623000	the basis of sort of the first wave of an interest in a kind of socialist cybernetics economics
623000	629000	that ended up, you know, was animated the work of, you know, people like to refer to Stafford Beer,
629000	635000	but also, you know, even in others, in certain sense, even across the political spectrum,
635000	641000	but certainly gave the rise to a kind of a different kind of idea of the mixture
641000	649000	between computation, socialism, and the planned economy here as well.
649000	655000	So the term synthetic catalacticy that I use, that I mentioned in the book, The Stack,
655000	662000	going now back to your original question, is a term that would refer to that process
662000	671000	by which the natural capacity for a market to find price signals, for example,
671000	679000	or to organize the relations between its negotiated participants
679000	685000	could produce this kind of what the Austrian school and its descendants like to think of
685000	692000	as a kind of spontaneous order, could produce this process of a spontaneous order at a great distance
692000	697000	and could do so at a scale, by using very large-scale computational systems,
697000	704000	planetary-scale computational systems, that that spontaneous order could be produced at a scale
704000	712000	that would be otherwise impossible to do just through the incremental aggregation
712000	719000	of lots and lots of different supply and demand signals,
719000	724000	could do so with a speed that would be impossible otherwise, and in principle could do so
724000	733000	with a capacity for reflexive collective reason that would be impossible otherwise,
733000	740000	and would be able to do so with some degree of recursive piloting or planning,
740000	745000	and this is where the cybernetic comes in, the kind of piloting function of the whole dynamic
745000	750000	in ways that would be impossible to happen just spontaneously.
750000	755000	Now, as you are all probably aware, Hayek sort of pooh-poohed this whole idea,
755000	773000	and indeed it was some of the Chicago school boys who were enthusiastic about the coup in Chile in 1973
773000	780000	that moved Allende and Stafford Beer's CyberSign project out of the way,
780000	788000	who later ended up becoming quite interested in the idea of the capacity for computational systems
788000	792000	to have these kinds of recursive market effects.
792000	798000	And so the last point I'll make before we move on from this with this and also to maybe introduce,
798000	804000	frame part of our discussion around the planned economy in relationship to socialism and capitalism per se,
804000	813000	is that perhaps one of the historical ironies of all of this is that we do have planned economies today.
813000	822000	We do have large-scale synthetic catalaxies in the scale that I'm describing,
822000	828000	in that this is how Walmart works, this is how Amazon works,
828000	836000	this is how Google works in terms of its pricing of words and semantics and page views and the rest of this as well,
836000	845000	is that many of the large capitalist platforms that increasingly, in a de facto basis,
845000	853000	have taken on many of the roles that had previously been assigned to states,
853000	864000	themselves are in ways that would absolutely be recognized as such in the high X era of the 60s and 70s, planned economies.
864000	868000	And they work because they are planned economies.
868000	877000	They work because they are able to calculate prices by integrating signals
877000	888000	with a speed and scale and complexity that would be impossible to do otherwise,
888000	898000	which allows them to do long-term planning, long-term recursive investment,
898000	906000	infrastructural investment and so forth and so on, all the things that the socialist cyberneticians were interested in,
906000	911000	in ways that they too would recognize as basically, yes, that's what we meant.
911000	920000	And this, again, is kind of the irony, that you can imagine plucking some of the socialist cybernetician economists from the mid-60s
920000	928000	and explaining to them how Amazon works, this very, very large scale global network that doesn't actually produce anything,
928000	935000	but matches buyers and sellers and is this massive logistical enterprise,
935000	944000	but whose real function as a social economy is the production, is the calculation and the computational calculation of a price
944000	950000	and then the logistical mechanism for the deliverance of this, yes, yes, yes, that's exactly what we mean.
950000	958000	And this is also then I think part of where maybe the interest discussion is that some of the more conventional Cold War left-right distinctions
958000	963000	of what is planned, what's not planned, what's centralized, what's decentralized
963000	972000	don't line up real well when we actually sort of investigate these processes that we're talking about
972000	976000	as technical systems and as institutional systems.
976000	983000	So in any event, that's my long answer to your simple question about what is synthetic catalectics.
983000	991000	That means we do indeed have synthetic catalectics, even though these are up until today capitalist ones.
991000	996000	I am very much interested in the possibilities of synthetic catalectics to come.
996000	1002000	And I would like to build a bridge actually between a proposal by one of my other guests, Daniel E. Seros,
1002000	1007000	and your analysis of what you have called platform of platforms.
1007000	1011000	And you actually described Amazon as such a platform already.
1011000	1016000	I think what Dan Seros describes in his book Information Technology and Socialist Construction
1016000	1021000	indeed is a different kind of proposal for a platform of platforms.
1021000	1028000	And I think it absolutely confirms an intuition you have articulated in the stack about how governance,
1028000	1036000	namely planning and programming, and I quote here, may be situated at if not originate from the interface layer.
1036000	1042000	There's a lot to unpack here. Let's do this step by step and start with a definition of platforms.
1042000	1050000	What are platforms and what could a platform of platforms that is different from those that we already have look like?
1050000	1053000	Well, it could look like it could look lots of things.
1053000	1058000	The platform, as I model it in the stack and discuss it in the stack,
1058000	1065000	I don't mean it in a way to sort of evangelize platforms or to argue that platforms are in themselves good or bad or whatever,
1065000	1072000	but rather to try to make the argument on behalf of, you know,
1072000	1080000	for a kind of future old political science or economics or indeed international relations or computer science
1080000	1088000	and most likely the way in which those approaches would need to kind of converge and understand each other a bit more,
1088000	1092000	particularly the computer science and political science.
1093000	1099000	To understand platforms not just as a kind of technical arrangement, but as an institutional form as well
1099000	1105000	and one that has logics that are different than states, that are different than markets,
1105000	1110000	that their political structure is different and indeed their economic structure is different.
1110000	1117000	So whereas a platform in the simplest sense can be understood as a kind of a set of generic,
1118000	1125000	a kind of a set of generic schematic arrangements that allows for the organization
1125000	1133000	of other forms of conditional participation within that schema to interoperate with one another
1133000	1138000	in ways that wouldn't have been possible without their participation within that platform.
1138000	1144000	And so the platform in this way has the capacity to, as a kind of translation mechanism,
1144000	1150000	a capacity as a kind of scaffolding system by which different kinds of actions and actors and participants
1150000	1154000	can organize in relationship to one another.
1154000	1157000	So lots of technical definitions of platforms.
1157000	1163000	One of my PhD students, Stephanie Shermans, currently writing a book on the kind of early history of platforms
1163000	1167000	in the industrial era with an emphasis on Fordism.
1167000	1172000	So it's also, I think, important to say just for your listeners that when we're talking about platforms,
1172000	1179000	we're not just talking about things like Airbnb and Uber and these contemporary versions of platforms
1179000	1183000	that, for example, Nick Terncheck writes about in Platform Capitalism,
1183000	1189000	where Nick is focusing on sort of the sort of contemporary face of many of these platforms.
1189000	1195000	We can also think of platforms going back to the beginning of the urban grid as a kind of platform.
1195000	1199000	Some would argue even the tetrahedral body plan as a kind of platform.
1199000	1205000	But the platform as an organizational and technical logic has a historical scope
1205000	1211000	that precedes computation and precedes planetary scale computation.
1211000	1217000	But it's one in which the planetary scale computations, we define it,
1217000	1221000	never would have happened if it was not organized through, as we understand it,
1221000	1224000	never would have happened if it wasn't organized through platforms.
1224000	1228000	So we can talk about things like the search engine as a kind of platform
1228000	1233000	in that a search engine doesn't make any of the content that's on the Internet.
1233000	1239000	It simply organizes the content that other people put on the Internet in such a way that in theory
1239000	1246000	it makes that content more valuable both for the producer and the receiver of that content.
1246000	1252000	So you put your website or your photos or whatever on the platform,
1253000	1259000	there's now thousands or if not millions of people who will see this information,
1259000	1264000	which in a way somehow makes it that now those items are more valuable for you
1264000	1266000	because you've placed them on the platform.
1266000	1268000	They're more valuable for the receiver to place on the platform.
1268000	1271000	And so this is all obviously in theory.
1271000	1276000	But here's that key idea around the economic difference
1276000	1279000	and where they differentiate from states and markets.
1279000	1285000	If states reproduce themselves, are able to in essence pay for their provision of public services
1285000	1293000	primarily through taxation, that they identify kind of choke points within value chains
1293000	1299000	such as a port or where goods are coming in and out or something.
1299000	1303000	And they identify these kinds of choke points within value chains
1303000	1312000	and then they absorb some of the value from these choke points in the form of taxation,
1312000	1317000	which then pays for the long-term provision of the public services that made the production of that value possible
1317000	1319000	in the first place and so on and so forth.
1319000	1322000	But it's through taxation in essence that they reproduce themselves.
1322000	1330000	Whereas corporations in the normal way of understanding them as capitalist structures
1330000	1334000	reproduce themselves through commodities and transactions,
1334000	1339000	that you produce a commodity, you pay charge more for the commodity
1339000	1344000	and there's difference in this surplus between the two in the form of profit
1344000	1348000	constitutes this ability for the corporation to reproduce itself.
1348000	1350000	Platforms don't work either way.
1350000	1353000	They don't tax you and they don't charge you.
1353000	1354000	So how do they work?
1354000	1361000	They work fundamentally through the rationalization of the information
1361000	1367000	that populates the platform in such a way that that information becomes more valuable
1367000	1369000	for the users of the platform.
1369000	1373000	It rationalizes the information that populates the platform
1373000	1377000	such that that information becomes more valuable for the users of the platform.
1377000	1382000	And that differential between, let's say, the value of the information before it's concluded
1382000	1389000	and after it's included in the platform is the basis of how they reproduce themselves.
1389000	1392000	Currently, many of those are then dependent upon
1392000	1397000	a sort of a secondary dependence market upon advertising.
1397000	1402000	But I would argue that that's sort of a contingent arrangement
1402000	1406000	that you can have and indeed have had lots of platforms
1406000	1411000	that are, that produce, that actually reproduce themselves
1411000	1415000	from many other kinds of ways besides that.
1415000	1420000	So first of all, just as a sort of a definitional basis of platforms
1420000	1425000	from the basis of our discussion.
1425000	1429000	So a platform of platforms, as you've asked me sort of here as well,
1429000	1434000	would refer to some other kind of meta-infrastructural mechanism
1434000	1439000	that allows for multiple platforms to interoperate with each other.
1439000	1444000	And so you can think of it a bit as a kind of first order platforms
1444000	1447000	that are structuring and scaffolding structural systems
1447000	1453000	that allow for the rationalization of information that's included in them.
1453000	1456000	And then you can imagine sort of an aggregation of multiple platforms
1456000	1462000	that in essence allows the platforms themselves to interoperate with one another
1462000	1467000	in such a way that they have this, in principle that you have an even more,
1467000	1472000	that you have other kinds of deliberate or emergent effects
1472000	1475000	situated one way or another.
1475000	1479000	Now, to the question about the interface layer that you asked
1479000	1482000	about where the politics sits within this.
1482000	1485000	I think in many ways the politics of the platforms
1485000	1487000	is situated in many different places.
1487000	1490000	And all the different points of description that I've argued here
1490000	1494000	are all places that are ones that are interesting
1494000	1497000	because they mediate power in some kind of way,
1497000	1501000	that they are relevant, platforms are relevant as social technologies
1501000	1504000	because they organize power in some way.
1504000	1508000	To me this isn't a reason to exclude them,
1508000	1512000	but rather to in essence to be interested in them
1512000	1516000	and to try to understand how they can function as means
1516000	1521000	for collective reason and societal self-composition.
1521000	1524000	And to be quite concerned about the ways in which they
1524000	1528000	are not living up to that assignment today
1528000	1531000	because we should expect that of them.
1531000	1534000	And because they may not be doing so today
1534000	1537000	it's possible to criticize them for this fact
1537000	1541000	because indeed this is something that should be expected of them.
1541000	1543000	The question of the interface layer,
1543000	1546000	the interface layer as I defined it has to do really with,
1546000	1550000	the interface layer is the semiotic layer within the system
1550000	1557000	that allows for the translation between users that are participating
1557000	1560000	in the larger system and that system itself.
1560000	1564000	So in the simplest sense you're using your computer,
1564000	1567000	you're seeing all the buttons with words on them on the screen.
1567000	1571000	Of all of the possible things you could do with your computer,
1571000	1573000	of all the possible things your computer could do
1573000	1575000	now that it's connected to the internet,
1575000	1579000	all of those trillions and trillions and trillions of possibilities
1579000	1585000	are reduced to a composable array of several dozen menu items
1585000	1589000	that you can sort of choose between.
1589000	1593000	That map reduction of all of those possibilities
1593000	1596000	into this composable array of menu functions
1596000	1602000	is unavoidably ideological, is unavoidably political
1602000	1604000	if you want to think of it in those terms,
1604000	1608000	constriction or collapse of the space of possibilities
1608000	1611000	into a range of options.
1611000	1613000	I would also argue though in a certain sense
1613000	1616000	that this is to a certain sense unavoidable as well
1616000	1619000	in that it has, when I call it a map reduction,
1619000	1621000	this is exactly what it is.
1621000	1624000	In the same way in which you don't want a map of your city
1624000	1627000	that is one-to-one with your city,
1627000	1628000	you don't want a map of the city
1628000	1631000	that includes absolutely everything in your city on it
1631000	1636000	and would be in essence the most accurate map possible of your city.
1636000	1638000	You want a map that only includes,
1638000	1642000	that gets rid of 99% of everything that's there,
1642000	1646000	that only shows you that 1% that might be the most relevant
1646000	1651000	for the purposes of the abstractions of navigation.
1651000	1653000	Interface layer functions in a similar way.
1653000	1657000	It's a kind of reductive abstraction of the space
1657000	1660000	of the vectors of navigation through the space.
1660000	1663000	And because of this function of simplification,
1663000	1670000	it also allows for the network effects of the millions of people
1670000	1676000	for whom this map is legible to actually use the system,
1676000	1680000	to participate in the system, to generate value for the system,
1680000	1683000	to have value generated for them from the system
1683000	1687000	because of its simplification and its arrangement
1687000	1689000	in the same way in which a simple map
1689000	1693000	makes the city navigable for more people.
1693000	1698000	On the one hand, you can see this as having a kind of democratizing effect,
1698000	1702000	but there's a political valence of that.
1702000	1705000	There's a political valence in the map reduction problem itself
1705000	1707000	and the ideological constraint.
1707000	1709000	There's also a political function of this
1709000	1712000	in that in the network's effects of participation,
1712000	1721000	you have the kinds of aggregations of user participants in such a way
1721000	1724000	that they themselves enter into social relations
1724000	1728000	that they wouldn't have been able to do so otherwise.
1728000	1731000	So we're still kind of setting the groundwork, I think,
1731000	1734000	for maybe the meat of our discussion,
1734000	1739000	but if that's helpful in terms of kind of the definitional terms
1739000	1746000	for how from not just a computer science perspective,
1746000	1750000	but indeed from a sociological theory or economics or political science perspective,
1750000	1753000	how it is that we can understand the terms of these interrelations
1753000	1756000	and what is specific about platforms,
1756000	1761000	what is generic about platforms in terms of how they function in these ways,
1761000	1765000	then perhaps that's helpful.
1765000	1767000	Yes, absolutely.
1767000	1769000	This is super helpful, I guess,
1769000	1773000	and it's super important that we get to understand this in a different form.
1773000	1776000	And you have already touched upon how...
1776000	1779000	I'm sorry, your question was about what other kinds of platforms could happen.
1779000	1784000	So the reason I answer in this way is that defining platforms in this...
1784000	1788000	I first would say there's lots of kinds of platforms that only could happen.
1788000	1792000	I want to point your listeners' attention also historically
1792000	1797000	to look at all of the kind of histories of platforms that in fact have preceded us
1797000	1799000	and to understand some of the structures there.
1799000	1802000	So I'm sorry, please go ahead.
1802000	1805000	No, I just wanted to say that we already touched upon
1805000	1812000	how this idea of platform of platforms might be able to address
1812000	1815000	what has been called the socialist calculation problem
1815000	1819000	or the socialist pricing problem, you call it.
1819000	1823000	But in your texts you also point that it might be able to solve
1823000	1825000	the capitalist pricing problem.
1825000	1828000	And maybe let's just point out what that is
1828000	1832000	and how a platform of platforms might be able to address this one.
1832000	1837000	Sure. Yeah, and there's lots of other pricing problems as well
1837000	1840000	besides just those two.
1840000	1845000	In some respects, I think we may want to...
1845000	1850000	Going forward, I think we'll probably want to open up the space of possibilities
1850000	1856000	beyond this sort of simple Cold War dynamic of that as well.
1856000	1860000	But yeah, to your point, I argue in the book that in many ways
1860000	1862000	it's the capitalist pricing...
1862000	1864000	The capitalist pricing problem, as I call it,
1864000	1867000	that it maybe is the more pressing issue now.
1867000	1872000	So if through whatever bending arcs of historical irony
1872000	1877000	it ended up being Walmart and Amazon that proved that Hayek was wrong
1877000	1881000	and that the socialist cybernauticians were right
1881000	1887000	and that these big capitalist companies solved the socialist pricing problem
1887000	1889000	in whatever strange way,
1889000	1892000	the capitalist pricing problem, as I define it,
1892000	1894000	really has to do in terms of...
1894000	1897000	is a way of thinking about pricing systems
1897000	1902000	in relationship to negative externalities.
1902000	1906000	And in a larger sense, I see this as part of the question
1906000	1909000	of the more important question of
1909000	1914000	ultimately what is planetary scale computation for?
1914000	1917000	If the stack was a book that was about
1917000	1921000	what is planetary scale computation and how does it work,
1921000	1925000	the next book is really more trying to speak to this question again.
1925000	1927000	What is planetary scale computation for?
1927000	1931000	How do we would see it in longer historical terms
1931000	1934000	and maybe even in geologic terms,
1934000	1937000	in sort of anthropocene scale kinds of terms.
1937000	1943000	What does it mean now that it's possible for human societies
1943000	1947000	and indeed human societies to calculate their own,
1947000	1949000	to model and calculate their own processes
1949000	1951000	with such speed and clarity,
1951000	1954000	but also in many ways how it's possible for,
1954000	1956000	if you think of the entire apparatus itself,
1956000	1960000	of the satellite systems, the transoceanic cables,
1960000	1963000	the data centers, this entire planet,
1963000	1966000	this entire kind of artificial crust
1966000	1969000	that we have produced around the surface of the planet,
1969000	1971000	what it means for also to create for a planet
1971000	1976000	to be able to model itself and act back upon itself
1976000	1982000	with such sophistication.
1982000	1985000	How do we understand this even in geological terms
1985000	1987000	in terms of the arc and history of the planet?
1987000	1990000	And so there's some questioning then
1990000	1994000	of how to locate the question of planetary scale computation
1994000	1996000	within some of the philosophical questionings
1996000	2001000	after planetarity itself and how this would function.
2001000	2003000	Now, to the question of the capitalist pricing problem,
2003000	2006000	back to this, the capitalist pricing problem,
2006000	2009000	as I define it, and again, it's rather schematic,
2009000	2011000	has to do with the negative externalities
2011000	2014000	within economic transactions
2014000	2018000	and this trying to locate the question of economics,
2018000	2024000	the ontology of economics within that of ecology more broadly.
2024000	2026000	Excuse me.
2026000	2029000	So the question of the ontology of economics,
2029000	2032000	that is, what is value? What is valuable?
2032000	2036000	And how can something be identified as valuable
2036000	2042000	in whatever sense is, in theory, represented within the price?
2042000	2047000	That if there is, in theory, 10 euros of value within this item,
2047000	2050000	that the price of this will be 10 euros,
2050000	2053000	and that the capacity for calculation,
2053000	2057000	the markets to calculate this or central computer to calculate this,
2057000	2060000	that there is some either correspondence
2060000	2062000	between the price and the underlying value
2062000	2064000	or distortion of correspondence
2064000	2067000	between the price and the underlying value.
2067000	2071000	And so for Hayek, the socialist pricing problem
2071000	2074000	represented a distortion of value
2074000	2077000	in that it could never really know
2077000	2079000	whether something was overpriced or underpriced
2079000	2082000	because it couldn't calculate it fast enough.
2082000	2085000	What many of those, it's not my idea,
2085000	2087000	but many of those working in fields of ecological economics
2087000	2091000	have identified is that there's a different kind of distortion
2091000	2094000	that's happening within the market price
2094000	2102000	in that there are underlying social and ecological costs
2102000	2107000	to the production and transaction and consumption of commodities
2107000	2110000	that are not reflected in the price.
2110000	2112000	These are called negative externalities.
2112000	2116000	They would include, so if that $100 barrel of oil,
2116000	2121000	if it costs $100 because the amount that's available
2121000	2124000	on the world market at any point in time
2124000	2129000	would suggest that this is the price of it,
2129000	2133000	what that price signal does not include, for example,
2133000	2138000	are the immediate and or long-term costs of burning that oil,
2138000	2143000	of releasing that, of liberating that carbon into the atmosphere,
2143000	2147000	and the costs of its ramifications,
2147000	2150000	whether those are immediate health costs
2150000	2153000	or long-term subtraction costs.
2153000	2156000	We were having a lot of discussions with colleagues
2156000	2159000	around negative emissions technologies
2159000	2164000	and the need for not only the decarbonization,
2164000	2167000	not putting more carbon into the atmosphere,
2167000	2170000	but the subtraction of existing carbon from the atmosphere
2170000	2173000	in order to keep it 2 degrees Celsius.
2173000	2175000	The real question of this is how do you pay for it?
2175000	2177000	Well, part of the reason you can't pay for it
2177000	2180000	is because the cost of the production of that carbon
2180000	2183000	in the first place was not reflected
2183000	2188000	in the price signal of the oil that produced that carbon
2188000	2191000	in its first instance, as you see.
2191000	2195000	And so this represents a distortion of the pricing.
2195000	2197000	The question then for going to this question
2197000	2200000	of what planetary scale computation is for
2200000	2202000	is to ask the question is,
2202000	2205000	would it be possible to undistort this signal?
2205000	2210000	Would it be possible for there to be a price signal
2210000	2214000	that was in essence not distorted in this way?
2214000	2217000	It would have to be a price signal where, for example,
2217000	2221000	the price of that barrel of oil would somehow be able to count,
2221000	2225000	be inclusive of not just the transactional value,
2225000	2229000	but ultimately all of the secondary and tertiary costs
2229000	2235000	and value that would be associated with that item,
2235000	2238000	such that it would be the cost of the barrel of mine
2238000	2241000	being $500 a barrel or $1,500 a barrel,
2241000	2245000	if that's what it would cost to actually deal with this.
2245000	2248000	Now, what I sort of hypothesize in the book a bit
2248000	2250000	more of as a thought experiment
2250000	2253000	than as a policy recommendation
2253000	2256000	is to ask them what you would need then is some ability
2256000	2263000	for some kind of economics calculative substrate
2263000	2265000	that was able not just to identify
2265000	2267000	the immediate transactional relations,
2267000	2273000	but to hypothesize a futural value of that,
2273000	2277000	to imagine in the future what the cost of that would be
2277000	2279000	that has not happened yet.
2279000	2281000	So you burn the barrel of oil in the future
2281000	2283000	that will be these costs that are associated with it
2283000	2285000	in the form of negative externalities,
2285000	2288000	but how much is that for one barrel of oil
2288000	2290000	or for 10 barrels of oil or for one bicycle
2290000	2293000	or for one lunch or for one whatever?
2293000	2296000	There would be a future cost that hasn't happened yet.
2296000	2299000	There would have to be a way, in essence, to price the future.
2299000	2302000	How would you calculate the pricing of the future
2302000	2306000	into the transaction in some kind of way?
2306000	2309000	So this sort of led us to some of the questions
2309000	2312000	about the ways in which planetary scale computation
2312000	2317000	has already been used as a method for futural modeling
2317000	2320000	and the production of models of the future
2320000	2323000	that can or should have some recursive capacity
2323000	2325000	to govern the present.
2325000	2327000	And that's really what I think this question
2327000	2329000	of the capitalist pricing,
2329000	2332000	the de-distortion of the capitalist pricing
2332000	2334000	that it comes down to,
2334000	2338000	how can objective empirical statistically valid models
2338000	2341000	of the future govern the present in some kind of way?
2342000	2345000	So that includes, there's a lot of other discussions
2345000	2348000	about just the general capacities of prospection,
2348000	2353000	of how it is that the predictive structures of the future
2354000	2356000	as part of human cognition play into this,
2356000	2359000	the ways in which the kind of preemptive logics
2359000	2362000	of the biopolitics of planetary scale computation
2362000	2363000	play into this.
2363000	2366000	But we were looking at basically two things.
2366000	2369000	One was climate science.
2369000	2372000	And one of the, I think the key points for this
2372000	2376000	is that I make the argument that climate change itself,
2376000	2379000	not the physical geophysical fact of climate change,
2379000	2382000	but the concept of climate change,
2382000	2384000	the statistical regularity that the earth is warming,
2384000	2387000	is itself an epistemological accomplishment
2387000	2389000	of planetary scale computation.
2389000	2392000	That without this sensing, calculation, simulation,
2392000	2395000	modeling apparatus of planetary scale computation,
2395000	2399000	the very idea of climate change as a kind of
2399000	2404000	reductive statistical regularity of a hockey stick arc
2404000	2406000	of all of the things that are going on in the planet
2406000	2407000	could not be possible.
2407000	2410000	And one of the things, it wasn't possible to calculate.
2410000	2413000	This is a better example of what planetary scale computation
2413000	2418000	is for, if you ask me, and a different kind of model
2418000	2420000	of its ultimate social, technical,
2420000	2422000	and ecological potential.
2422000	2424000	But it's also one that is based on this,
2424000	2428000	of a kind of a temporal and historical differential
2428000	2430000	between the past and the future.
2430000	2433000	It's used not only to mark a present moment,
2433000	2436000	but also to sample moments in the past
2436000	2439000	through ice core sampling or other kinds of things
2439000	2443000	to try to understand the kind of the calculus,
2443000	2445000	the statistical differential arc of this
2445000	2447000	over a long period of time,
2447000	2449000	and also to produce valid computational simulations
2450000	2452000	of what the next 10 years, or 20 years,
2452000	2454000	or 30 years, or 40 years are being like.
2454000	2456000	And so when we look at all the IPCC scenarios,
2456000	2458000	and they're forking into the future,
2458000	2460000	depending on what happens,
2460000	2462000	these are computational simulations
2462000	2467000	dependent upon different presumptions and first principles.
2467000	2471000	But they are models of the future that we can
2471000	2474000	and should be using to govern the present.
2474000	2477000	That's what climate science is going to do for it.
2477000	2479000	And so this is one example by which, yes,
2479000	2482000	we can imagine ways in which we have models of the future
2482000	2485000	that we wish to have recursively come back
2485000	2487000	and model the present.
2487000	2490000	The other one, a bit more prosaic that we've been
2490000	2494000	experimenting with is around, of all things, insurance.
2494000	2500000	Insurance is another way in which the future is priced,
2500000	2505000	and that it's priced in a way that acts back upon
2505000	2509000	the changes, the price signal of something we do in the present.
2509000	2515000	So if you're, one of my favorite magazines of all time
2515000	2518000	is a magazine called Schaden Spiegel.
2518000	2522000	It's the magazine of the German Reinsurance Agency.
2522000	2525000	It's basically like disaster monthly,
2525000	2531000	but it also has some of the most amazingly sober
2531000	2535000	descriptions of the implications of climate change
2535000	2538000	on large-scale infrastructure that you'll be able to find anywhere.
2538000	2541000	Because they're the ones on the hook for a lot of this,
2541000	2544000	ultimately, of where this would go.
2544000	2547000	And so if you wanted to build that piece of infrastructure,
2547000	2549000	not only does it need to be insured,
2549000	2551000	but the insurance company needs to get reinsurance against it.
2551000	2554000	And if the reinsurance company realizes that that thing
2554000	2557000	is going to be extremely vulnerable to climate irregularities,
2557000	2560000	you can't get it insured.
2560000	2563000	Or if you get it insured, the price of doing it now
2563000	2566000	is going to be so much higher because that insurance policy
2566000	2569000	will be so expensive that it actually changes the price signal
2569000	2573000	of whether we should build that infrastructure thing in the first place.
2573000	2575000	So you see where I'm going with this.
2575000	2580000	That if you can actually think about what the long-term climatic ramifications
2580000	2584000	of some kind of action or investment would be in the future,
2584000	2589000	such that those negative externalities are not only not excluded
2589000	2594000	from the price, but are formed the basis of the model
2594000	2598000	by which the price is produced in the first place.
2598000	2604000	Then you go some distance towards at least de-distorting
2604000	2610000	that initial price signal in such a way that you have a transformation
2610000	2615000	to some extent what we even mean by price in the first place.
2615000	2620000	You introduce a different temporality to economic ontology,
2620000	2626000	and that what constitutes value is being produced
2626000	2632000	in relationship to not only future value in the same way
2632000	2635000	as stock price is related to future value,
2635000	2640000	but also related to future costs in ways in which that are inclusive in this.
2640000	2645000	This is a bit what we mean by that idea.
2645000	2650000	Obviously, some of the open questions here is how total of a system
2650000	2653000	is necessary for this to work.
2653000	2658000	Is there a way in which does this have to be entirely some sort
2658000	2662000	of massively centralized mechanism, but through which other forms
2662000	2667000	of valuation can't escape, or is there some kind of way
2667000	2672000	in which even the organized participation
2672000	2680000	within a kind of economics of this sort that is futureal in this way,
2680000	2687000	that is inclusive of what are present externalities in some sort of way,
2687000	2693000	is there some kind of way that participation on this can be incentivized
2693000	2700000	in a way in which it itself becomes a kind of catalytic institution,
2700000	2704000	a kind of bottom-up institution rather than necessarily one
2704000	2711000	that requires some kind of Skynet system to enforce itself.
2711000	2715000	I think that's kind of an open question,
2715000	2719000	which means that in a certain way we're back to where we started.
2720000	2724000	Is that if all of this started in a debate between is it possible to have,
2724000	2728000	can we only have bottom-up organization of this and will it work itself out,
2728000	2731000	or do we need some kind of centralized top-down piloting function
2731000	2733000	to make all of this work properly?
2733000	2737000	If that's where this argument started in the 1950s,
2737000	2740000	even when we're talking about how you incentivize participation
2740000	2744000	within this situation I described,
2744000	2749000	that question doesn't present itself as already solved.
2751000	2756000	This is super interesting and I think there's a different layer to it,
2756000	2759000	which is quite important as well,
2759000	2762000	because actually I think what you're kind of saying is that
2762000	2767000	the future is already priced, but it could be priced much better.
2767000	2771000	And this kind of stays within the realm of pricing the future
2771000	2777000	and argues for better models and the incorporation of externalities
2777000	2780000	specifically into the question of pricing.
2780000	2782000	For example, yes.
2782000	2785000	But there is a different level,
2785000	2789000	and maybe this is the homo sapiens level at the end,
2789000	2791000	there's a different level to this.
2791000	2794000	And Evgeny Morozov writes about it in his essay
2794000	2797000	in the New Left Review on Digital Socialism,
2797000	2799000	and I'd like to quote him here,
2799000	2803000	When Austrian economists respond to today's defenders of central planning
2803000	2806000	by noting that any non-capitalist system,
2806000	2809000	even one rooted in the power of big data,
2809000	2812000	could only beat the efficiency of the price system
2812000	2817000	if it also created new behavioral modes and frameworks of meaning,
2817000	2819000	they have a point.
2819000	2821000	I think this is super important
2821000	2824000	and I think it's relevant for what you just said as well,
2824000	2827000	and at least in two key aspects,
2827000	2832000	it's relevant for the question of synthetic catalectsies to come,
2832000	2836000	specifically if they are embedded in some form of red futurism.
2836000	2839000	The first one would be, and this is implicit in Morozov's quote,
2839000	2842000	that prices are not just numerical, but social,
2842000	2845000	and that it is therefore not enough to find a different method
2845000	2847000	of quantification or weighing.
2847000	2850000	So this would kind of mean that it's not enough
2850000	2853000	to price the future even better,
2853000	2856000	because there's still the question of new behavioral modes
2856000	2858000	and frameworks of meaning,
2858000	2861000	which are kind of an obstacle and a chance, I guess.
2861000	2865000	And the second one is that markets are not equal to capital
2865000	2869000	and that capital does not necessarily need markets,
2869000	2872000	and that therefore the force of capital as such
2872000	2875000	would need to be abolished if one wanted to be serious
2875000	2878000	about synthetic catalectsies as red futurism.
2878000	2881000	And this is a specific form, you know?
2881000	2884000	So I think those are probably two questions,
2884000	2887000	and maybe if I just, so I can keep them in my mind at once,
2887000	2890000	maybe we ask them, I'll try to answer them one at a time,
2890000	2893000	and maybe you can ask me the second one again after this as well.
2893000	2898000	So I would say that I don't disagree,
2898000	2902000	I probably don't disagree essentially with the point that
2903000	2906000	that simply another,
2906000	2909000	just a different means of calculating price
2909000	2912000	about the same thing would be sufficient.
2912000	2916000	What I'm calling a kind of a shift in economic ontology
2916000	2919000	goes to that question of what value is
2919000	2922000	and what is even being priced in the first place.
2922000	2925000	So it's not just when we're talking about a barrel of oil,
2925000	2929000	it's not just this particular assemblage of molecules
2929000	2931000	that is transacting owners,
2931000	2935000	but it's understood to be a whole other set
2935000	2938000	of past, present, and future dynamics
2938000	2943000	that one has illegal liability in its relationship to
2943000	2945000	that becomes part of the price.
2945000	2948000	And I think another way in which this goes back to this question
2948000	2950000	of insurance and another future thing,
2950000	2955000	part of the question about price has to do with,
2955000	2958000	and another kind of externality is a political externality
2958000	2962000	in that it is the institutions that allow in essence
2962000	2966000	for the renunciation of liability in relationship to something.
2966000	2969000	And you can just think, I mean, in the simplest possible sense,
2969000	2972000	think of this in terms of like trash.
2972000	2974000	So like you've got something in your house
2974000	2977000	and you put it out in the garbage can
2977000	2979000	and like someone comes along and takes it and says,
2979000	2981000	well, this isn't yours anymore
2981000	2983000	because you put it in the trash, right?
2983000	2986000	And somehow in the act of like getting rid of it,
2986000	2990000	you're not only renouncing property claims over it,
2990000	2995000	you're also renouncing liability claims over it as well, right?
2995000	2998000	And so part of the process of the reason
2998000	3001000	why negative externalities can even work in this way
3001000	3006000	is because we have this magic function
3006000	3009000	by which the renunciation of private property
3009000	3012000	constitutes the renunciation of liability.
3013000	3016000	So I can spew all of the carbon dioxide
3016000	3019000	into the atmosphere once I want.
3019000	3024000	And once it's sort of above the airspace property line
3025000	3028000	of my factory, it's no longer my carbon dioxide,
3028000	3031000	and therefore I'm no longer liable for this carbon dioxide.
3031000	3035000	So you see the point about this renunciation of liability
3035000	3036000	in this space as well.
3036000	3039000	Now, what I'm talking about as the shift
3039000	3044000	of a kind of economic ontology has to do some ways
3044000	3048000	in which that magic function of renunciation of liability
3048000	3052000	and renunciation of sort of embeddedness
3052000	3055000	within these socio-molecular relations
3056000	3059000	is not something that can be so easily renounced,
3059000	3061000	that is in fact part of what you're buying
3061000	3063000	when you enter into the relations
3063000	3066000	with that barrel of oil in the first place.
3066000	3069000	So that is part of what I mean.
3069000	3071000	So that is a bit where it seems like
3071000	3074000	I probably agree with Evgeny in the sense to which
3074000	3076000	it's not just a matter of finding another mechanism
3076000	3078000	by which we measure the same thing.
3078000	3080000	It's a matter of changing
3080000	3082000	what we're measuring in the first place.
3083000	3085000	But where I would say, where it may be disagree,
3085000	3086000	when he says something like,
3086000	3087000	I think your line was a measure,
3087000	3090000	it's not just a matter of measuring and calculating
3090000	3093000	something but rather something else
3093000	3094000	because these have social relations.
3094000	3096000	I think my point is that measuring and calculating
3096000	3097000	are social relations.
3100000	3102000	What he's saying is it can't just be
3102000	3104000	these measuring things because it's social.
3104000	3106000	I'm saying that is in fact what the social is.
3106000	3109000	Measuring things and calculating things and weighing things
3109000	3111000	not only have social functions,
3111000	3113000	they are social functions.
3113000	3116000	They are sort of the key social functions
3116000	3121000	as part of this whole kind of dynamic as well.
3121000	3125000	And so it is for sure something that needs to go deeper
3125000	3127000	into this question of how we identify
3127000	3129000	not only how we value the thing
3129000	3131000	but what the thing is in the first place.
3131000	3132000	So agreed.
3132000	3134000	Now whether or not this constitutes
3134000	3138000	a kind of behavioral change, it would.
3138000	3141000	It's a matter of, it's an open question though
3141000	3143000	I think whether or not the behavioral
3143000	3145000	and psychological transformation would be the cause
3145000	3146000	or the effect.
3148000	3150000	And honestly there's sort of different approaches
3150000	3153000	and schools of thought to this.
3153000	3156000	And this probably goes to a more deeper
3156000	3159000	sort of approaches to ecological politics
3159000	3163000	and indeed just the kind of dynamics in general.
3163000	3165000	For those whose alliance,
3165000	3167000	whose those sort of like way of seeing the world
3167000	3171000	is one in which large scale change happens
3171000	3174000	through the accumulation of virtuous acts.
3174000	3178000	That if enough people do enough virtuous acts
3179000	3182000	and those virtuous acts assemble into millions and billions
3182000	3184000	and trillions of virtuous acts,
3184000	3187000	then there will be an infrastructural transformation
3187000	3192000	will ensue through this deliberate conscious
3194000	3199000	psychological moral shift in paradigmatic worldview
3201000	3205000	and then the accumulation of virtuous acts.
3205000	3206000	And then there's others.
3206000	3209000	And I would be on the second side of this a bit more
3209000	3212000	that would suggest in many ways the history of technology
3212000	3214000	and the history of society are not only intertwined
3214000	3217000	with one another, but in many respects,
3217000	3220000	shifts in social systems and in cultural systems
3220000	3222000	and indeed in political and economic systems
3222000	3227000	usually happen more as an effect of transformations
3227000	3231000	within underlying technological systems.
3231000	3233000	This is in a certain sense
3233000	3236000	based a superstructure kind of approach
3236000	3239000	that in transformations not just in the means of production,
3239000	3241000	but indeed in the mode of production
3242000	3245000	that you then see shifts in culture
3245000	3248000	and shifts in psychology as a result of these.
3248000	3250000	And so I think in many respects,
3250000	3255000	my inclination would be to look at ways
3255000	3259000	in which you'll get greater leverage faster
3259000	3264000	by looking at ways in which there would be shifts
3264000	3267000	in geotechnology and shifts in geoeconomics
3267000	3270000	that would bring about shifts in geoculture
3270000	3275000	rather than trying to bring about a spiritual transformation
3276000	3280000	that would subsequently down the line
3280000	3282000	transform those geotechnologies.
3282000	3285000	It's really not because of an aesthetic preference
3285000	3287000	of this so much, but rather than just,
3287000	3289000	I think that the history of economics
3289000	3291000	and the history of technology suggest
3291000	3295000	that that's the more likely path.
3296000	3299000	But at least as far as I understand it,
3299000	3301000	the question that he's aiming at when he's saying
3301000	3304000	new behavioral modes and frameworks of meaning,
3304000	3308000	it's more about what are the crucial points
3308000	3313000	that are not only concerned with these technical aspects
3313000	3317000	of, for example, how to price the future any better
3317000	3320000	because these ideas of externalities
3320000	3324000	and how you can behave with your property,
3324000	3328000	this is ingrained in the very concept of property as such.
3328000	3332000	So if you are not able to change this idea of property
3332000	3336000	as a form of behavioral mode and a framework of meaning,
3336000	3341000	then you won't get to a point where you will be effective
3341000	3346000	in bringing people to a point of not treating it
3347000	3349000	as an externality.
3349000	3350000	Do you see what I mean?
3350000	3353000	I think there's a way of approaching it
3353000	3355000	from the perspective of, okay, we need to find
3355000	3359000	a more effective pricing mechanism for these externalities,
3359000	3363000	or we need to find a way to address this social institution
3363000	3366000	of property as such because the property as such,
3366000	3369000	as a social institution and a framework of meaning,
3369000	3372000	is one of the root causes for the ways we do address
3372000	3375000	these questions on a large scale.
3375000	3378000	And this is not coming from a moral perspective,
3378000	3382000	but as well from a perspective of effectiveness, I guess.
3382000	3384000	Possibly.
3384000	3386000	I agree with you everything up to the point of the phrase
3386000	3387000	root cause.
3387000	3390000	I see it as root effect.
3390000	3396000	I completely agree with you that ultimately you can't have
3396000	3398000	one without the other.
3398000	3400000	I don't argue with this at all.
3404000	3408000	If there is a changing in somehow, even at the level
3408000	3411000	of some shift in the geotechnology of pricing
3411000	3414000	and organization and the ontology of property
3414000	3418000	that has some kind of planetary scale legal binding structure,
3418000	3425000	if this isn't, in fact, become part of the culture
3425000	3428000	of our relationship to object and molecular assemblages
3428000	3430000	around us and our socioeconomic environment,
3430000	3433000	if it doesn't actually become a social infrastructure
3433000	3438000	and doesn't actually become the basis of the way
3438000	3442000	in which we plan, conceptualize, model,
3442000	3446000	and recursively organize our relationship
3446000	3449000	to the material world, then it's nothing.
3449000	3454000	It's not even a technology because it's not being used.
3454000	3455000	There's no argument.
3455000	3457000	I absolutely agree.
3457000	3459000	And then part of the question is, how is it
3459000	3464000	that at societal levels that the kind of models
3464000	3470000	that we have, cognitive models, at an individual level
3470000	3473000	and at a group level, cognitive models that understand
3473000	3478000	and calculate advantage, calculate the future,
3478000	3481000	calculate our interests, calculate our interactions
3482000	3486000	with these kinds of things are done so in relationship
3486000	3488000	to these differential systems.
3488000	3492000	If that isn't part of how we are rethinking the world,
3492000	3496000	then these technologies are, in fact, not even technologies.
3496000	3499000	I would agree with that because they're not
3499000	3501000	being used in this way.
3501000	3506000	What I'm simply suggesting is that there is a presumption,
3506000	3509000	and I think, honestly, I think it's one that's rather deep
3509000	3513000	in a Western liberal individualist framework,
3513000	3518000	that first there is a cognitive psychological transformation
3518000	3522000	that then is made manifest upon the world,
3522000	3528000	that somehow the agency and subjectivity are the same thing,
3528000	3531000	that our agency in the world is ultimately
3531000	3533000	a function of our subjectivity.
3533000	3537000	And what I'm suggesting, honestly, I think I'm making
3537000	3540000	more of a Marxian argument that in many ways
3540000	3543000	that the transformations in the mode of production,
3543000	3546000	and I would include these shifts in economic ontology
3546000	3548000	as a shift in the mode of production,
3548000	3554000	ultimately transforms the culture in its image more so.
3554000	3556000	You can't have one without the other,
3556000	3558000	but in terms of where it is that we should,
3558000	3564000	where I would place my bet, now speaking of the future,
3564000	3569000	so placing my bet on which is more a cause of the other,
3569000	3572000	I'm going to vote that base causes superstructure
3572000	3577000	more than superstructure causes base.
3577000	3579000	Nice, super nice.
3579000	3583000	I love this answer, and it already touches upon
3583000	3587000	one of the next questions which is concerned with the individual.
3587000	3593000	This has been the first part of the Future Histories Live event
3593000	3595000	with Benjamin Bretton.
3595000	3598000	I hope you enjoyed it, I certainly did.
3598000	3600000	If you want to support Future Histories,
3600000	3605000	then you can do so via Patreon or through a simple donation.
3605000	3608000	And if you're not able to support Future Histories economically,
3608000	3610000	then this is absolutely fine,
3610000	3613000	because there is a fantastic money-free way
3613000	3615000	to support the project too,
3615000	3618000	and that is by telling a friend about the show
3618000	3621000	who might be interested in the topics we discuss here.
3621000	3624000	Thank you all, and hear you in two weeks.
