1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
It is absolutely incredible that economic concepts and tool sets are being implemented

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,840
deeply into computational processes and into network security processes.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:24,320
I think this is actually quite a big deal, intellectually, technically, philosophically.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
It is quite a big deal.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,560
I first realized this when I went to a Bitcoin conference a while back and it was really

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
interesting.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,200
I was like, wow, it's basically cryptographers that are discussing economics.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,840
Cryptographers discussing economics.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,800
That's a perfect start for today's episode.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,680

Welcome to Future Histories.

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,560
My name is Jan Groß and my guest today is Dr. Jaya Clara Brecke.

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,680
She's a researcher investigating what matters politically in blockchain technology at Derham

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
University.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Welcome Jaya.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Hi.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,720
I think most of my listeners will have heard of the term blockchain at some point, but

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,920
I think there's still actually considerable confusion and quite a lot of mysticism around

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,240
the technology.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,120
So let's cover the basics first.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,680
What is a blockchain and what types of blockchains are there?

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Okay, so the way I tend to explain blockchain is I actually I go back to cryptography and

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,400
I go back to starting off with explaining what cryptographic hashing is for those who

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,640
are not familiar.

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,640
So essentially, you know, this is a mathematical process where you take some data, you put

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,080
it through this process and it spits out a string of numbers or a string of numbers and

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,200
letters, characters, whatever kind of hashing algorithm you're using.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,000
And this has a very particular set of characteristics, which are extremely useful because only the

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,460
exact same data would spit out that particular string of numbers.

45
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,760
So what that means is that if anything in the data changes, you can detect that by running

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,320
the hashing algorithm again, and if it doesn't spit out the same number, then you know something

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,560
has been tampered with.

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,320
It's a very useful way of verifying the integrity of data.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:26,480
So you add a timestamp to this and you string this together in a chain of hashed data.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,560
And what you essentially potentially have is a linear history of, you know, things that

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,560
have changed over time or, you know, sets of data over time.

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,800
So that's essentially, you know, the kind of blockchain in terms of kind of data structure.

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,920
But then there is the question of how do you, if you want to have this taking place in a

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,300
decentralized network, how does the decentralized network come to an agreement around what data

55
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,400
should be added and hashed into this chain in the first place?

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,500
So how do we come to an agreement about what has happened, you know, in a given context?

57
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,560
In the case of Bitcoin, what has happened in terms of transactions?

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,160
In the case of Ethereum, what has happened in terms of computation?

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,080
But it could be any potential data.

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,320
So that consensus mechanism is what's called proof of work in Bitcoin and in many other

61
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,680
cryptocurrencies.

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,200
There are other consensus protocols.

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm going to explain the one that Bitcoin uses.

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,520
That's the kind of starting point, let's say.

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,840
But you also have things like proof of stake.

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,040
You have things like proof of importance and proof of cooperation.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,440
So the way the consensus protocol takes place in Bitcoin is the network competes on grouping

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,640
together the transactions into blocks and running it through a hashing process that

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,040
needs to spit out a number that meets certain requirements.

70
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,920
If it does not spit out that number meeting certain requirements, then they have not successfully

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
mined a block yet.

72
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
So they need to try again.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,520
And by trying again, they basically just add a nonce, which is a random number to the data

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,960
until the random number that they add to the data affects the output string of number in

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,360
such a way so that it meets the requirements.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,960
So what is it we have here is actually a quite profound shift in understanding around the

77
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,000
word consensus and an understanding around how a network reaches consensus.

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Because if we think about this as a model for governance, this is a model for agreeing

79
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:38,240
about what actually happened, you have gone from previous models that could be a political

80
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,200
leader decides what's true or not, a judge decides what's true or not, a religious leader

81
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:49,920
decides what's true or not, or science or some kind of philosophical understanding of

82
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,920
truth of events and so on to a system which is essentially, you know, the way that it

83
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,400
decides what's happened, the way that it's decided what's true is through randomized

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,200
turns that is that is incentivized through rewards.

85
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:17,360
So you have a competition to be the one to define which transactions are considered valid

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,560
or what data is considered valid for that round.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,480
So you have all these, you know, this whole network of computers that are taking turns

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,080
that are competing with each other to be the next intern to define the truth for that next

89
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
block.

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,160
That is essentially the kind of Bitcoin consensus protocol.

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,160
So blockchain technology did have very political goals from the start, and one of them actually

92
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,800
being the goal of overcoming politics altogether.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,160
How did you approach the question of the political in your work on blockchain technology?

94
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,160
So first of all, it was really kind of working that out, you know, understanding, you know,

95
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:10,280
where what's really kind of the underlying ideas that gave rise to this technology.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,400
And from that, I really, you know, I articulated this thing that actually, you know, what seems

97
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,840
to be happening here is an attempt at a kind of technical fix, a technical solution to

98
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,560
the problem of the political.

99
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,440
So if we understand the political as basically the negotiation of incompatible differences

100
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,880
through lots of different means, that would be one definition.

101
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,040
What you have here is a technology that tries to kind of resolve that in some kind of final

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
manner.

103
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,840
So, you know, you take the problem of power and authority that will be replaced by a decentralized

104
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
network.

105
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,720
So problem of authority has been solved.

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,600
The problem of consensus between, you know, incompatible positions, well, we've got an

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,680
algorithm that will do that and an algorithm that will do that in a way that's decentralized,

108
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,200
meaning no one can control it, which means that it can be considered somewhat, can be

109
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,880
considered neutral.

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,840
And then we have the problem of how to enforce that and secure the system.

111
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,240
And, you know, code will enforce it and cryptography will secure the system from any kind of

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,520
attacks or manipulation.

113
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,240
So the idea is like these components somehow resolve the problem of the political in some

114
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,560
kind of final way.

115
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,800
So a lot of my work, I guess, was partially kind of untangling where do these ideas come

116
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:40,960
from and how are they sought to be kind of like written and encoded and what's that

117
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,040
process, what has that process looked like?

118
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,000
And also to look at kind of, you know, there's lots of different theories around like understanding

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
the politics of technology.

120
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,920
One of them is, you know, really understands the political as something that then gets

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,360
inscribed into a piece of technology or an infrastructure so that a certain kind of politics

122
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,440
or ethics will be operating in a kind of imminent manner.

123
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,920
So, you know, say, for example, for me, like a really good example is the door closer that

124
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,160
I think Bruno Latour uses and is, you know, one kind of easy way of understanding this

125
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,280
principle, which is basically like a door closer will automatically close the door and

126
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,920
that enforces a certain kind of understanding that the door being closed is good, whereas

127
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,340
the door remaining open is bad.

128
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,920
So therefore we have this door closer that's now going to continue to enforce that regardless

129
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,000
of what we feel about it or not.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,760
Of course, the door closer is radically different from a complex network because the door closer,

131
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,760
if you disagree with it, you just kind of like put something to block it from working

132
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,040
or you pick it apart or whatever else, it's quite easy to change those conditions.

133
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,200
And it's also quite easy to see what exactly is enforcing those conditions, where in complex

134
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,320
network technology, sometimes it's pretty hard to understand where and why something

135
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
turns out the way it turns out and how to fix that.

136
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
And it requires certain skills to understand that and requires certain skills to tinker

137
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
with it.

138
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,960
Of course, in blockchain and in the kind of open source movement, that problem is attempted

139
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,280
to be addressed by actually making things open source and trying to kind of explain

140
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,320
systems and involve people in a variety of ways.

141
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,880
And that's like a very positive side of the culture.

142
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,840
But I think I lost my thread there a little bit.

143
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360
I don't mind.

144
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,080
It's good because you pointed towards you looking at the history of network cultures

145
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,560
actually in order to understand how this, you call it blockchain sensibility, got formed

146
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,080
the way it is.

147
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,840
And I think you did a very good job in pointing out that we should definitely take a second

148
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:13,840
look and that both the evangelists, like the blockchain evangelists, should get away from

149
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,320
easy dichotomies, but also the critics.

150
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

151
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,600
I mean, so because what I was observing was obviously, you know, the people that are attracted

152
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,040
to blockchain come from a variety of different backgrounds.

153
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,200
I mean, it's really attracted a lot of people from across different political spectrums

154
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
and across different kinds of political cultures and histories.

155
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,940
And so to me, it just seemed like, you know, although I think like some of the criticisms

156
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:48,340
that have come, that does analyze, you know, especially things like Bitcoin and so on as,

157
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,180
you know, a kind of right wing capitalist kind of project or a narco capitalist project,

158
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,660
you know, sure, there's certain truth to that, but it just didn't seem to be telling the

159
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
entire story.

160
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:07,140
And it was telling a very kind of US centric history of blockchain to analyze it just on

161
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,140
those terms.

162
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,820
And I was trying to understand what else was going on or what was missing from that

163
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,980
picture because I was observing people really from lots of different political backgrounds

164
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,700
getting involved.

165
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,420
And so for me, it was more interesting to look at the kind of like history of decentralization

166
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,460
and peer to peer and look at some of the kind of practical problems that different technologies

167
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,500
have been trying to solve.

168
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,940
And one of them, I mean, really, you know, like the kind of history of peer to peer in

169
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,460
terms of network cultures really has been about authority and it really has been about

170
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,580
how can we create networks that even if like one person gets arrested or one server gets

171
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,340
taken down, the network itself can still continue to function and can still continue to operate.

172
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:59,060
And these were kind of pragmatic problems, you know, that the piracy movement or anti

173
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,860
copyright movement has been dealing with.

174
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,260
You know, these are problems that like, you know, different kind of, you know, indie media

175
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,260
type projects have been dealing with.

176
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,660
You know, it's really this question of, or this, let's say, using decentralization as

177
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,940
a way to circumvent authorities, you know.

178
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,700
So but what for me was interesting was some things have changed from the early history

179
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,940
of peer to peer to, you know, where we're now at with blockchain technology.

180
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,580
And a lot of that has to do with kind of like a shift in understanding where instead of

181
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:42,580
using peer to peer or decentralization as a kind of specific strategy for specific political

182
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,060
projects or purposes, it becomes a kind of abstract political aim in itself.

183
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,100
And that's where I think like this idea or this kind of illusion of like having resolved

184
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,940
the problem of the political in some kind of final manner comes about, right.

185
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,980
And it's also where, to be honest, I think like, you know, by abstracting these things,

186
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,980
that's why you see something like Ethereum being able to appeal to, you know, financial

187
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,980
industries plus governments plus activists plus, you know, pretty much anybody or anything

188
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,100
because this thing has been taken out of it, right.

189
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,540
It becomes this kind of like generalized abstract thing where there's no, yeah, the kind of

190
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,640
political project is abstracted, let's say.

191
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,940
So everyone can see a certain kind of way of potentially using these technologies for

192
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,980
some efficiency gains or whatever else.

193
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,980
But for me, yeah, for me, there's like something strange that happens with that abstraction

194
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:56,060
where kind of grounded understanding of what's in operation with the technology is lost.

195
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,300
And I'm trying to, so what I'm trying to do in the thesis is give, you know, some access

196
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,820
points to that.

197
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,820
And actually, it feels as if a specific type of looking at the world is actually generalized.

198
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,540
And when I was reading your thesis, I had to think about like how it reminded me of

199
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,740
how game theory was invented in the sociopolitical arena of Cold War politics in a very specific

200
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,860
context.

201
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,860
And then it kind of got generalized as well, kind of similar to the way that Ethereum kind

202
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,580
of set the scene to generalize this very specific understanding that comes out of like decentralized

203
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,420
security modeling, actually.

204
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:58,420
And I was wondering, because I mean, that might be unfair again, you know, but kind

205
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,540
of it felt as if the same type of paranoia-ish looking on the world is generalized in game

206
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,980
theory in the first place.

207
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,980
And then a technology like Ethereum comes along and kind of builds and technological

208
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,980
infrastructure to generalize it in technical terms as well.

209
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,540
Yeah, absolutely. And it's, you know, there's a whole set of kind of strange contradictions

210
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,340
at play here.

211
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,300
So you're right. I mean, what I'm tracing in my PhD also is like the set of problems

212
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:41,300
that come about when you create a decentralized network, the set of technical problems, which,

213
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,500
you know, in terms of network security is this issue that, you know, in a truly decentralized

214
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,620
network, anyone can potentially be an adversary, right?

215
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,400
And so, you know, a lot of that idea of like how do you secure against the fact that anyone

216
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,080
can potentially be an adversary does feed into the kind of like general understanding

217
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:13,080
of the world really is like, you know, trying to eliminate trust, you know, trying to solve

218
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,360
the trust problem, which is like, you know, how big or how blockchain tends to be understood

219
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,800
these days.

220
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,800
But it's like very fuzzy, the exact limits to where things are being solved or what's

221
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,040
being solved here exactly, because in each and every moment, there is so much trust involved.

222
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,760
You know, you've got to, you know, there's no one that has actually gone through and

223
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,020
audited every single piece of code or understood every single piece of, you know, cryptographic

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,220
hashing algorithm that's being used and verified themselves as a single individual.

225
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,440
You know, there are obviously communities of trust in a real sense, even in blockchain

226
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,120
technologies in so-called, you know, trustless networks.

227
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,720
So like, yeah, there is this kind of imagination or this ideal that like ultimate, you know,

228
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,480
the ultimate system is a system where nobody needs to be trusted.

229
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,760
And that's kind of necessary to reach this ideal of a secure decentralized system replacing

230
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,880
authorities.

231
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,760
But in actual fact, the way it plays out doesn't quite look that way.

232
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:32,000
It just, there's a kind of reconfiguration of how trust operates.

233
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,160
There was something else I wanted to say on that, but it slipped my mind now.

234
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm sure it'll come up in a different form.

235
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,800
Well, yeah, and I think I'll have a good point to get into it, because you describe four

236
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,640
principles of blockchain technology and afterwards you have a short paragraph where you let the

237
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,760
reader know how different the way the terms are being used actually is.

238
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,040
I mean, you just said it in relation to trust, but actually it's in relation to decentralization

239
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
as well and consensus and stuff.

240
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:10,720
So could you maybe explain the four principles and how the way these terms are being used

241
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,120
is actually quite counterintuitive to the way we use it in like everyday language?

242
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Yeah.

243
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,320
Yeah, so I guess, so what I'm saying in this section is trying to kind of compare, like

244
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:36,200
you say, how we understand some of these terms, trust, openness, decentralization, and immutability

245
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:44,080
quite differently in our social lives than what becomes technically articulated and how

246
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,680
that technical articulation then becomes a kind of certain view of the world or a certain

247
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,360
kind of understanding of the world.

248
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,000
So generally speaking in social life, more trust is a good thing, right?

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,640
If we create kind of more trust between us, that's a good thing.

250
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:13,040
Whereas in kind of blockchain, trust is considered something that needs to be eliminated entirely.

251
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,080
In some ways, there's some interesting dynamics that I don't think I go into so much in this

252
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:30,760
paragraph about that, but about how that's in many ways a kind of feature of lots of

253
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,840
different aspects of technology and scientific devices in general, that we trust the observation

254
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,480
of a measuring device more than we would trust someone's account of it.

255
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,800
So take like temperature measurements, for example, it's like someone's like, oh, this

256
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,840
feels really, really hot, and it's like, no, the thermometer says it's only 20 degrees

257
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,520
outside or things like this where there's like a certain kind of, we assign a certain

258
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:09,640
kind of validity to the return of certain kinds of technical instruments and apparatuses

259
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,000
more so than our kind of common experiences.

260
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,560
I mean, that's not to pit the kind of human against the machine in any kind of way.

261
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,280
It's just an observation about how devices and apparatuses sometimes operate.

262
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,160
And I say it only because it's such a major, major part of the political proposition of

263
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:40,360
blockchain to create a kind of governance apparatus, essentially, that is somehow constructed

264
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,040
by a set of elements that are beyond the control of human beings.

265
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,160
And that's like the explicit aim.

266
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,320
That's the kind of that's the political aim of the project, really.

267
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,600
So let's go into that.

268
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,940
What's the role of algorithmic governance in blockchain technology?

269
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,060
So what is the narrative around it and what are the narratives of future that are connected

270
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
to it?

271
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:14,980
Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand entirely the question, if you can make it more specific.

272
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:22,340
Well, you kind of said right now that one of the main purposes of blockchain technology

273
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:35,380
is being a technology for governance purposes in order to provide a different way to actually

274
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,940
organize society as a whole, you know?

275
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,260
And so there's a narrative, a political narrative connected to this technology that is tightly

276
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,740
coupled to the idea of algorithmic governance.

277
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,820
What's the idea behind it?

278
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,300
How do they want to use algorithmic governance to reorganize society?

279
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,820
Yeah, I mean, so, you know, one point that I've been making a lot throughout my thesis

280
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,540
in the kind of not just in the written piece, but also in the talks that I've been giving

281
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:14,860
and so on, is this kind of irony or this kind of this observation that like peer-to-peer

282
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,320
technology, you know, there's a lot of focus on this ambition of disintermediation, right?

283
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,680
To get rid of the kind of intermediary, the middleman, so that we can have kind of direct

284
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,040
relations with one another.

285
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,520
And so for transactions, that would be like, let's get rid of the banks and the governments

286
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,880
so that we can just exchange value directly between each other without anyone, you know,

287
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,880
either controlling whether we can do that or not, or like the surveillance and gathering

288
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,840
information about us and our transactions.

289
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,120
And so there's like this focus on disintermediation and getting rid of the middleman.

290
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,360
But then on this kind of like political ambition, I mean, you look at this thing and it's like

291
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,200
the most incredible, like the most intense form of intermediation you can imagine when

292
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
it comes to questions of governance, right?

293
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:11,120
We're bringing together like, you know, networks and algorithms and protocols and game theory

294
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,160
and market dynamics and you name it, all into this kind of like some kind of apparatus that

295
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:24,200
is supposed to kind of sit between all of us and enforce some kind of consensus between

296
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,720
all of us.

297
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:33,000
So it's this very intense form of intermediation, actually, and a hugely complex form of intermediation.

298
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Yeah, so on the question of algorithmic governance, it's so, I mean, with blockchain, I think

299
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,720
I mentioned already in the definition how, you know, the technology looks to solve the

300
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,960
problem of the political.

301
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,280
And so you have, you know, something like, you know, you have consensus algorithms that

302
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,560
organize consensus amongst nodes in the network.

303
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:04,720
But also, you've got things like decentralized autonomous organizations, you've got things

304
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,360
like smart contracts.

305
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:16,480
So ways of trying to kind of automate certain aspects of governance and contractual relationships,

306
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,440
let's say, so that they once again cannot be controlled by any single individual, but

307
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,520
that run, you know, across a kind of decentralized network.

308
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,880
And there's lots of kind of directions that people imagine this going in.

309
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,120
And so, you know, the kind of like fantasy, which is both the kind of like dystopian fantasy,

310
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,680
but also something that you see people in the blockchain space talk about with like

311
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,240
really kind of like feverish bright eyes is this, you know, this combination of blockchain

312
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,520
with AI, you know, that, you know, will have, you know, AI emerge, which will be this kind

313
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:05,600
of like, yeah, perfect, scary, non-human, but amazingly mathematical intelligence that

314
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:14,720
will use the kind of power of cryptography and the kind of uncontrollable, uncontrollability,

315
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,680
unstoppable ability of smart contracts to basically run the world.

316
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,600
And specifically in terms of this narrative for future, there has been some setbacks to

317
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,560
say it mildly.

318
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,800
So there was a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, as you mentioned, in Ethereum,

319
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,480
on the Ethereum blockchain.

320
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
And there was a lot of hype around it.

321
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,280
And at some point it got hacked.

322
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:52,000
And actually, what followed then was some kind of reflection about the limits of this

323
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,840
kind of thinking.

324
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:02,400
And for some, it was like a, I think it was just the lesson that we just didn't do it

325
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
good enough yet.

326
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Yeah.

327
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,640
And for others, they thought, all right, well, this showed us actually that it's not just

328
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,240
a deterministic world we're living in that can be handled in this kind of way, but there

329
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,240
are different aspects, like social aspects and stuff that have to be considered in this

330
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
kind of thing.

331
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Yeah.

332
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Yeah.

333
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,080
So I write quite a bit about that event in my thesis also.

334
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:37,520
I mean, the problem is, so, you know, the story of blockchain and what it can do and

335
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,760
the story of blockchain plus AI, you know, these things, they sound so convincing.

336
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,400
But one of the main reasons why they're so convincing is because when you kind of, when

337
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,600
you look at the story, you're looking only at the story and you forget to look at everything

338
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,560
outside of it, when actually everything outside of it really matters for how that story will

339
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,720
play out in reality.

340
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:06,300
And to take a very basic example, this idea of a kind of, you know, blockchain system

341
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:13,740
that runs entirely without authorities, you know, at some point, someone had to write

342
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,740
that protocol, right?

343
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,340
And so that someone, you know, or those groups of people, in essence, have then written the

344
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,340
rules of society, right?

345
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,100
If indeed this thing was going to continue to run without it being controlled or without

346
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,180
it being kind of modified and so on.

347
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:39,100
But also what happens is in reality, not only has someone or people writing protocols,

348
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,740
but also the protocols need to be maintained and updated and things break and nothing is

349
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,140
ever written perfectly.

350
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:53,100
And, you know, so there is this kind of like real kind of difference or real gap between

351
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:03,180
the kind of the perfect ideal that somehow kind of, you know, mathematics, cryptography

352
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,300
and technical systems, you know, they give us this kind of mental image of something

353
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:13,740
that is perfectly neatly organized, perfectly rational and perfectly objective, when in

354
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,740
actual fact, like that's a kind of it's a mental image of it.

355
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,900
Whenever people actually write these things down, obviously, like it exists as part of

356
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:28,580
a kind of far more complex world where lots of other dynamics play into how a system

357
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,300
will actually operate and the actual effects of a system.

358
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:38,780
And so what happened in the DAO attack was, you know, there was this decentralized autonomous

359
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:44,620
organization and it was supposed to be governed purely and only by the rules written in its

360
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,380
smart contract.

361
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,860
And this smart contract lived in a decentralized network and no one was supposed to be able

362
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,700
to modify it or change it after it had been deployed.

363
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,700
So it was deployed and lots of people invested in the decentralized autonomous organization,

364
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
I think up to 60 million dollars.

365
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,540
No, more than that.

366
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,580
I think over 100 million dollars.

367
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:17,380
And then all of a sudden people saw that there was an amount of investment that was being

368
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,540
taken out of the DAO contract repeatedly.

369
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:28,980
And so it turned out that in the contract code, this was possible through a kind of

370
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,980
combination of a couple of different rules that had been specified in the contract.

371
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:40,380
And someone was literally emptying the fund and got away with about 60 million dollars.

372
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,040
And the reactions to that were, you know, kind of split the community.

373
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:53,720
So some people felt like, you know, this needed to be stopped.

374
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,680
This should never have happened.

375
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,520
We should intervene.

376
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,760
And another set of people were like, no, because the rules said that only the smart contracts

377
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,800
governs this thing.

378
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,520
And so therefore, if what's written in the smart contract is the only thing that governs

379
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,400
it and it allows for this person to actually or this hacker to actually siphon off this

380
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,880
money, that should be allowed to go ahead.

381
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,760
And so what you saw was, you know, the Ethereum Foundation got quite concerned and got involved

382
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,680
because this was a considerable amount of the actual total amount of ether in the market.

383
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,200
And so they decided to go in and intervene and basically do what's called, I guess you

384
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:47,680
could call it a kind of rollback on the Ethereum blockchain and fork the blockchain so that

385
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,320
before the hack attacked and kind of pretend that in the history of the Ethereum blockchain,

386
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:00,200
this hack had never actually happened to then buy time to go in and retrieve the funds.

387
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,760
And that's like a clear act of a kind of outside authority in a sense, right?

388
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,080
And so there was a lot of like soul searching in the community about whether or not that

389
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,760
was a good thing or not, whether that should be possible at all.

390
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,520
And it did split the community.

391
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,800
And so you have two different versions of Ethereum running now, one that has a history

392
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,200
of events where this hack never happened, and one that has a history of events where

393
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,120
it did happen.

394
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:39,000
And so for some people in the Ethereum community, the way of making sense of this in terms of

395
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,680
decentralization and so on, was to say that social consensus trumps computational consensus.

396
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:54,480
So this idea that like it was actually okay for the Ethereum Foundation to step in and

397
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,480
retrieve the funds by forking the chain because there was agreement, there was broad agreement

398
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,760
in the community that that was what needed to be done.

399
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:14,480
And that agreement was expressed through the adoption of nodes in the network of this new

400
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,000
version of the Ethereum blockchain.

401
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,240
So in many ways, you could say there was a decentralized consensus around moving forward

402
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:29,040
on that decision, although there was a kind of another splinter group that disagreed.

403
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,200
So there's lots of stuff going on here.

404
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:40,440
But what I think really kind of was very nicely kind of demonstrated to the community was

405
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:48,680
that you don't get rid of the complexity of the world, you don't get rid of human beings,

406
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,720
you don't get rid of all these things so easily.

407
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,680
And they actually play a pretty important role for how systems play out.

408
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:03,480
Like there's no there's no final guarantee against like against the indeterminate reality

409
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,720
that we live in, you know, things kind of unfold.

410
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,000
I mean, yeah, there's there's so many ways of kind of saying this.

411
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,120
And I keep saying it that, you know, this idea of a kind of final solution to the problem

412
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,200
of the political, it's I mean, it's cute.

413
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,480
And I understand where it's coming from.

414
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,040
But really, you know, cryptography doesn't do that.

415
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,320
There is nothing that does that.

416
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,960
I mean, time keeps passing.

417
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,760
And between us, there's just too many, there's there's too many unknowns in the universe.

418
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,720
It's like it's a radically open future, you know, and you take something like cryptography

419
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,840
that is that is really, let's say, the the cornerstone of this political or this kind

420
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:58,000
of belief system in blockchain, this idea of like the, you know, the security of cryptography

421
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,760
being like something fixed and something something determined, you know, that we can somehow

422
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,920
build everything else on top of, you know, I went to I went to Bletchley Park the other

423
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,400
day, which is I don't know if people know what that is, but it's it's where Alan Turing

424
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,440
and a bunch of other English mathematicians got together during the Second World War to

425
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,440
break the Lorenz, the German Lorenz cipher machine.

426
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,520
And a few of them did and invented the Colossus in order to do that.

427
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,800
And it's you know, it's a very good it's a very kind of historical reminder and an epic

428
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,520
reminder of the fact that cryptography, you know, is is never final.

429
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,640
You know, it can be broken and and it is repeatedly broken and it's an ongoing process.

430
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,040
Cryptography is very interesting to use in different kinds of systems design because,

431
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,360
yes, it does buy you time and it has some incredible properties, but but it doesn't

432
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,360
resolve things in any final in any final way.

433
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,560
It's not bulletproof.

434
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,440
It's just another device that we humans have invented in our engagement with with the kind

435
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,520
of elements of the universe that we live in, you know, with the mathematics that we that

436
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,320
we've kind of developed. Yeah.

437
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,520
That was a lot.

438
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:32,720
That's good. And actually, there's a there's another element that kind of undermines this

439
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,840
perception of blockchain technology being a truth machine.

440
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:43,800
In your thesis, there's a part where you describe this actually quite fitting.

441
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
I'll just quote it.

442
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,440
Actually, I think if we take a closer look at how double spending is solved and how consensus

443
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,520
is arrived at in decentralized networks, there is, in fact, no need to determine which

444
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,600
of the conflicting transactions is true because from the perspective of the system, it does

445
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,640
not matter which is verified as long as it is just one of them.

446
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,080
What is true or really happened is not of importance.

447
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
End quote.

448
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,200
So I really like that because the consensus this means that means that the consensus in

449
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,840
blockchain is actually far from being any kind of objective truth, but it is what you

450
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,480
later call an incentive driven settlement.

451
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,960
And I think this is very spot on because it kind of begs the question, how does this affect

452
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,520
the the the kinds of truths?

453
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,080
Is that the plural of truth?

454
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,200
I don't know the truths that that can be produced because I'm actually like one hundred percent

455
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:50,080
sure that there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many truths that cannot be produced

456
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,680
with this specific type of thinking.

457
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Yeah.

458
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,680
Yeah, it's another kind of like cute.

459
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,840
I say cute because it's another kind of cute approach to some of the kind of deep complex

460
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,160
problems of the political.

461
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,560
And I say cute because it's a kind of backing down of or a kind of historical accumulation

462
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,920
of disappointments in authorities.

463
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,480
So it feels a little bit like this child that who's who realizes that its parents are

464
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,320
fallible, you know, and goes looking for something that isn't fallible.

465
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,840
And so, you know, and the reason why I say that is because, like, OK, so, I don't know,

466
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,200
to me, it does seem like, you know, it's trying to instead of instead of instead of trying

467
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,840
to ponder what truths might be out there and try and work through that in all the kind

468
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,280
of philosophical implications and all the social implications and through all the kind

469
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,240
of historical pain and so on that has that has happened in this pursuit of truth.

470
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,880
And here I'm talking about religion.

471
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,640
I'm talking about political ideologies.

472
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,920
I'm talking about geopolitics, you know, and and historical events.

473
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:22,480
This is the kind of idea that, like, we don't need a universal truth coming stemming from

474
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,840
kind of human reflection.

475
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,800
All we need is something that ensures that who gets to determine the next round of truth

476
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:38,640
is randomly selected in a way that can be deterministically analyzed as as decentralized,

477
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,640
as fair. You know, there's no single node in the network that will be able to determine

478
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,360
the truth over and over and over again.

479
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,440
It's always going to be a different node in the network.

480
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,000
So it's this kind of mathematically randomized set of truths.

481
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,920
And there's some, you know, so when we talk about truth machine or this idea of

482
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,840
blockchain as truth machine, that is the kind of truth that's being produced.

483
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,080
It's it's it's, you know, and this is, again, a little bit of an abstraction because,

484
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,000
like, OK, we're analyzing proof of work.

485
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,880
And so the truth that we're talking about here is whether a transaction happened or

486
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,840
not in the Bitcoin blockchain or whatever.

487
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,120
And so it's a bit of an extrapolation to talk about kind of more existential or political

488
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,840
truths. But I think I do think that extrapolation makes sense because that is the

489
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,200
kind of ultimate political imaginary that's at play here in blockchain.

490
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,200
But, yeah, it's it's a very particular it's a very particular kind of and strange and

491
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,160
funky and quite interesting way of arriving at a set of truths.

492
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,360
And I'm sure that that, you know, I do I am curious about, you know, the experiments in

493
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,920
this space to see what and how we might be able to use something like this.

494
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,720
But I'm also quite firm about finding the very specific appropriate uses of it and really

495
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,880
not having this as some kind of overarching ideology, because, like you say, this form

496
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,840
of consensus, this way, this method at which to arrive at consensus around truth is a very

497
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,720
specific way. It's very different from, let's say, a group of people that get together in

498
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,400
a room and share their experiences about something that then arrive at some kind of

499
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,600
shared understanding of what has happened.

500
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,400
That's a very, very different process and a very, very different way of being in the

501
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,160
world and acting in the world and understanding the world than the proof of work consensus

502
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,840
algorithm. Right.

503
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:53,320
Actually, I'm keen on looking a bit closer on this subset of being incentive driven,

504
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,120
because I think that's quite relevant.

505
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,080
And you can see this in other fields as well.

506
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:06,880
When, for example, a blockchain technology has to resolve the problem, how to bridge

507
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,440
the gap into the material world, like the non-digital world, then things come into play

508
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,080
like oracles and stuff.

509
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,280
But these oracles, they are market driven.

510
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:26,400
So it's a monetary incentive that is supposed to deliver the best possible truth, not the

511
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,680
ultimate truth, maybe.

512
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:40,200
But it's constructed as if this monetary incentive is able to produce the best workable

513
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,240
truth. And I think this goes down to the bottom of the protocol when it comes to

514
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:52,560
something like crypto economics, because there also you have this kind of techno

515
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,000
engineering idea or behavioral engineering idea, you call it, I think, in the thesis as

516
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:11,360
well, that you might be able to construct a good system architecture through actually

517
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:19,600
carrots and sticks, which are, again, monetary incentives or the punishment of taking away

518
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,920
some money.

519
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,080
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

520
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,000
And there, again, it's interesting to look at how things are done or might be done

521
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,560
differently in a social scenario.

522
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,440
Right. So, you know, we're working with crypto economic designs, then it is very much,

523
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,560
like you say, kind of crude, carrot or stick kind of set of tools that are being used.

524
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,280
Yeah, I think maybe for the listeners, could you briefly explain what it is?

525
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,000
Crypto economics, what that means?

526
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,120
Yeah, and it won't be brief, I'm sorry.

527
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,600
Go ahead, go ahead.

528
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,480
Because because I think, again, there's there's an interesting alternative history that

529
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,800
hasn't really been discussed or written much about crypto economics.

530
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:13,440
But crypto economics basically comes from, you know, in the Bitcoin protocol, what you

531
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:21,600
have is a set of miners in the network that verify transactions, and those miners are

532
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:29,120
rewarded with some Bitcoin every time they successfully manage to verify a block of

533
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,320
transactions. And they're rewarded with a Bitcoin partially with the idea that if it

534
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:42,280
pays more to contribute to the system than it does to attack it, then you'll have a

535
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,680
system that essentially, yeah, it's a it's a kind of element of the security of the

536
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,280
system, you'll have a system that runs that runs well.

537
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,280
And so you've got you get even more kind of sophisticated versions of that, that, you

538
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,720
know, you kind of economically reward good behavior in the network, and economically

539
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,720
punish bad behavior in the network.

540
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,520
And you see kind of different designs of that in different protocols in the blockchain

541
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,000
space. And some of them get very elaborate.

542
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,600
And I used a Bitcoin example because it's kind of one of the kind of more simple ones and

543
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
easier to understand.

544
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,560
So, yeah, it's a kind of combination of game theory and market dynamics in a kind of

545
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,040
cryptographic decentralized network space.

546
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:37,280
But the other story to that that I think is a very interesting angle is to understand this in

547
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,880
terms of business models, because if we take, you know, the kind of business models of

548
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:52,680
platform, the kind of like Internet platforms of today that use a kind of data extraction as

549
00:45:52,680 --> 00:46:00,320
their business models, data extraction and advertising, if we want to create new kind

550
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:08,280
of a new type of Internet, you know, Web3, and if we want to create kind of new types of

551
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:15,720
decentralized applications that make it cryptographically impossible for the kind of

552
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,320
business models that rely on data extraction in that kind of a way, then we need a different

553
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,200
kind of economy that runs these systems.

554
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,360
And so for me, the interesting side of crypto economics, the really interesting side of

555
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,000
crypto economics is the dream of and the idea of creating systems that are kind of

556
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,280
economically autonomous and viable to run without the need for surveillance or

557
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,040
surveillance capitalism or platform surveillance or, you know, the kinds of business

558
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,920
models that we see run the Internet today.

559
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,720
So that for me is like the kind of opportunity, the interesting possibility of crypto

560
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
economics.

561
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,240
Awesome. I think it's really, really important to point that out, because I mean, also for

562
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:05,280
someone like me, it's kind of like overwhelming how the way crypto economics is

563
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:13,360
handled is narrowed down to this idea of actually socio-technical engineering, which

564
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,400
I think is really behavioral engineering, which I think is really actually a very

565
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:26,640
dangerous road to to go on, you know, and it's very refreshing the way you did describe

566
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:33,440
it right now that there are also, well, this might be a like acute danger to use the

567
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,160
technology in the way of behavioral engineering or such.

568
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:46,800
There are these other possibilities to actually use the technology in a way that is

569
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
very much beneficial for everybody.

570
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:55,400
Yeah. Yeah. But I think like in order for that to actually be able to happen, the space

571
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,840
needs a lot of new thinking, especially from people that come from a heterodox economic

572
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,880
thinking, because like right now what you've got is a bunch of programmers and computer

573
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,360
engineers tinkering with economic tools.

574
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:17,760
And so and from their perspective, they're trying to achieve certain security properties

575
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,040
in the network. And so economics is being used in order to achieve those security

576
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,080
properties. And that's why it tends towards behavioral engineering.

577
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,840
That's why it tends towards like, how can we kind of make sure that certain types of

578
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:37,480
behaviors, you know, honest behavior is happens, whereas kind of dishonest or malicious

579
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,120
behavior is made impossible?

580
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,800
You know, so that's like it's really the computer engineers perspective.

581
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,440
But if we can have kind of more thinking in the space that looks more at this question of,

582
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,040
you know, the business model of the Internet and the kinds of economics that might happen

583
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,680
in that space, you know, if we can kind of start deliberately shaping that in some ways,

584
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,200
I think that would be like super interesting.

585
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,240
I think that's like, yeah, an important direction to work on.

586
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,720
Very much so. But I have to say, I think it's in the in the current state, it's not just

587
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:19,040
that the programmers are thinking in terms of security models, and that's why there's

588
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,000
this kind of misunderstanding.

589
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,480
But I'm afraid that I think what's happening right now, and you can see that in the

590
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,280
collaboration between Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and Glenn Whale, an

591
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,520
economist who wrote Radical Markets, what like the next level of shit in this sense

592
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,120
is that they are very much aware of that.

593
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:52,280
This is not just about security modeling, but they believe crypto economics to be the

594
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,080
appropriate social technology to design society.

595
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
That's that's the impression I get.

596
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:07,200
And that and that for me means that there might be a lesson learned in terms of how

597
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:14,400
autonomous systems are not fully controllable and that we should put some social input

598
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,120
into how to govern things and stuff like that, to say just a bit simple.

599
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:27,920
But that in the final step, there's still a belief in engineering society through

600
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,520
appropriate technological architectures.

601
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:39,040
Actually, they really call it, he calls it the new social technology, like crypto.

602
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,720
Yeah. Yeah.

603
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:48,840
And this is where I think it's important to understand power a little bit better and

604
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,360
different forms of power, because in the blockchain space and I think in society in

605
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:01,080
general, when people kind of think of power just off the top of their heads, what comes

606
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,400
to mind is a kind of authoritarian dictator.

607
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Right. What comes to mind is like a kind of centralized, you know, some kind of centralized

608
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,960
power where one person or one party or whatever determines everything and kind of power

609
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,760
radiates from that kind of central point.

610
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,400
But there's there's so many more theories of power and ways of understanding power that

611
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,760
are much more kind of apt at describing our current kind of conditions.

612
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:37,080
One of which, like in the case of what you just described, that is quite useful for

613
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:45,920
understanding, for understanding this condition is like a kind of power that operates

614
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,080
more on the landscape of what's possible.

615
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:57,040
So instead of having a centralized person dictate what needs to happen, you kind of

616
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,880
model the landscape in a way that makes certain types of things seem like they're just

617
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,680
naturally impossible to do or very difficult to do and make other things feel like they're

618
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,080
very desirable to do.

619
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,120
And that's what a lot of kind of protocological design really is about.

620
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,160
And that's what a lot of kind of crypto economic design really is about, is, you know,

621
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,400
to kind of make certain types of behavior desirable for someone on a kind of intuitive

622
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,960
level. So it doesn't feel like an authority is dictating anything to you.

623
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,080
It's just the way the landscape looks.

624
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,320
It's easier to go that, you know, down that road than it is to climb over that hedge.

625
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:42,760
You know, and so, you know, I think keeping an eye on that is is is very important also

626
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,680
to be able to analyze, you know, analyze what is the types of, you know, what is the

627
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,560
politics that's being inscribed in the protocols that then shape that landscape, you know?

628
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,240
Yeah. What's the main takeaway from your research?

629
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:09,720
Oh, wow. The main takeaway.

630
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:21,880
Give me one moment, because there's so many that we've touched on.

631
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,480
What's the main takeaway for you?

632
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,400
I think it's that we should all be aware that there is no wholesale answer to anything,

633
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:37,640
actually, and that these things are, like, context specific and that they have, like,

634
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:46,280
a side that might benefit us that is very much context specific, but another one that is not.

635
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,280
And we shouldn't, like, alles über einen Kamm scheren.

636
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,720
I don't know the English word for that.

637
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,480
Like, we shouldn't approach it as if it's all the same.

638
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,280
Take a second look. Maybe that's.

639
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right.

640
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,800
I mean, really, that is the main takeaway.

641
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:14,920
The main takeaway is, or the main work that I'm trying to do here is to, first of all,

642
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:23,480
shift the understanding away from trying to arrive at some final solutions to problems

643
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:31,880
of power and politics and these issues, and to create some ways to feel OK about the fact

644
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:39,960
that we do live in an infinitely complex world and universe where the work is ongoing.

645
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,360
And that's part of the excitement of things, right?

646
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,040
These new technologies can do incredible things.

647
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,320
History doesn't stop.

648
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,440
The work doesn't stop.

649
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,640
The game doesn't stop.

650
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,760
The kind of interaction.

651
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,320
I mean, there's so much more interesting things to come.

652
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,800
And all this stuff will break and get old at some point,

653
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,840
and we'll move on and something else will happen.

654
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,920
And it's really kind of tracing through and sticking.

655
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,120
There's just a fantastic title of a book by Donna Haraway that came out last year,

656
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,120
Staying with the Trouble.

657
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,000
That's what it's about.

658
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,440
And I say this not as a kind of trying to create some kind of new universal statement,

659
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,000
but more like literally staying with the trouble

660
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,120
and understanding the details of how these technologies play out

661
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,760
and getting involved in how they play out.

662
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,520
Great final words.

663
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,520
I usually put one question at the end,

664
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,760
which is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

665
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,120
If I think about the future, what makes it that the future is radically open.

666
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,080
The future has never been more radically open than it feels right now.

667
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,440
And that to me is incredible.

668
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,360
Awesome.

669
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Jaya, thank you so much for the interview.

670
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,360
Thank you, Jan.

671
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,960
That was our show for today.

672
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,600
