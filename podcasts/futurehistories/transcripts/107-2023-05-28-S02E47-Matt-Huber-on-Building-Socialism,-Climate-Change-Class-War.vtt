00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome Matt Huber in today's episode.

00:07.800 --> 00:13.400
Matt is Professor of Geography and the Environment at Syracuse University

00:13.400 --> 00:20.400
and author of Climate Change as Class War Building Socialism on a Warming Planet.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.800
I recorded this episode at the The Great Transition Conference

00:24.800 --> 00:29.800
where I was invited to take part in a symposium on democratic economic planning

00:29.800 --> 00:35.200
and I want to send my warmest thanks to the organizers of the conference in general

00:35.200 --> 00:39.600
but also to the organizers of the symposium specifically.

00:39.600 --> 00:47.800
Thank you Simon Tremblay-PÃ©pin, I'm sorry if I butcher your name, very sorry Simon, I hope it's not that bad.

00:47.800 --> 00:54.600
So thank you to Simon and his team and thank you to the Democratic Planning Research Group

00:54.600 --> 01:01.000
at the Research Center on Social Innovation and Transformation at St. Paul University Ottawa.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
You'll find links to their work in the show notes and I want to particularly highlight

01:07.000 --> 01:12.300
the work of their collective planning for entropy, you'll find their paper

01:12.300 --> 01:20.100
Democratic Economic Planning Social Metabolism and the Environment linked in the show notes as well, please go and read it.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.400
It's unfortunately behind a paywall I have to admit

01:23.400 --> 01:30.600
but you know the Spiel and if you write one of the authors, for example Simon,

01:30.600 --> 01:34.200
I'm quite sure that he'll be happy to send the paper to you.

01:34.200 --> 01:41.000
Huge shout outs also to Ref and Gherm who presented in the session before the one that I was on.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
It was a pleasure meeting you all and it's really inspiring to see that the debate around democratic planning

01:48.000 --> 01:52.100
has so many great people from different fields working on it.

01:52.100 --> 01:55.400
I'm very much looking forward to everything to come.

01:55.400 --> 02:04.800
I recorded two episodes during the conference and one or two might be in the making with people I met or contacted there as well.

02:04.800 --> 02:11.500
The two that I already recorded during the conference are the one with Matt Huber that you are about to hear

02:11.500 --> 02:15.900
and the second one is a conversation with Elisa Long-Conn-Antileo

02:15.900 --> 02:20.700
who was the first president of the Constitutional Convention in Chile

02:20.700 --> 02:24.400
and I was really happy to be able to talk to her as well.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.700
I recorded both of these episodes at the same day

02:27.700 --> 02:34.400
and it was really interesting for me to have these two very different conversations so close to each other.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.500
The episode with Elisa will be up next.

02:37.500 --> 02:45.300
Before we start today's episode, I want to welcome Johannes, Grishan and Marc as patrons of Future Histories

02:45.300 --> 02:50.100
and I want to thank Fabian and Lucas for their kind donations

02:50.100 --> 02:58.900
and now, please enjoy today's episode with Matt Huber on building socialism, climate change and class war.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.200
Welcome, Matt.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.200
Thank you for having me.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.700
It's a great pleasure.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.800
Matt, let's start with an overview of your general argument in climate change as class war.

03:13.800 --> 03:17.200
What are the main points that you wanted to bring across?

03:17.300 --> 03:26.500
Well, I start the book by saying that the main problem we have is we're losing the struggle to solve climate change.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.200
Emissions keep going up.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.800
They reached a record in the year the book was published in 2022

03:33.800 --> 03:38.700
and as long as emissions are going up, we still are losing the struggle.

03:38.700 --> 03:45.400
So, you know, what I argue is that the struggle is really a power struggle

03:45.400 --> 03:51.300
over a class of people that control our energy system and control it for profit

03:51.300 --> 03:58.100
and that if we want to win the struggle, we're going to have to build a hugely powerful movement to take on those interests.

03:58.100 --> 04:07.500
And so what I argue is that the current climate movement as it's constituted is not particularly powerful.

04:07.500 --> 04:13.400
It's pretty much embedded, I argue, in the kind of what I call the professional class,

04:13.400 --> 04:22.000
kind of minority of highly educated populations that work in academia or NGOs, scientists.

04:22.000 --> 04:31.200
And what we have is, you know, a pretty significant group of people in these kind of micro political spaces

04:31.200 --> 04:37.000
that aren't really able to build a much broader mass politics around climate.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
And for that, I argue, so I take a pretty standard sort of Marxist approach.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.700
That class is really about who controls production.

04:46.700 --> 04:52.100
I critique the way in which climate change is often discussed as a problem of individual consumption

04:52.100 --> 04:56.400
and consumptive behavior, individual carbon footprints.

04:56.400 --> 05:02.800
And I argue that really it's about how we produce energy, how we produce commodities,

05:02.800 --> 05:13.200
how we produce food, you know, and the kind of underlying industrial systems that are sort of behind the scenes in production.

05:13.200 --> 05:22.500
And so I argue from a standard Marxist perspective, you know, the working class has particular power objectively

05:22.500 --> 05:29.600
by being the vast majority of society, by actually doing the work in these systems that can actually,

05:29.700 --> 05:36.100
you know, withdraw their labor, go on strike and actually force a crisis on the elites to pay attention.

05:36.100 --> 05:43.200
So that actually, if we could start to construct a more working class climate politics,

05:43.200 --> 05:47.000
we could maybe start to think about building a much more powerful movement.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.300
So I think about that in two ways.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.300
This is just an overview.

05:51.300 --> 05:56.800
But that, you know, we need a certain kind of climate program that will appeal to the whole working class,

05:56.800 --> 06:07.200
which is again, the majority of society, people struggling to make ends meet, struggling to pay for rent and utility bills and all the rest.

06:07.200 --> 06:16.700
And so if we can, you know, pair climate decarbonization with more increased secure access to people's basic material needs,

06:16.700 --> 06:20.000
you could start to build a much broader popular base.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.900
So that's sort of the broad strategy.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.400
People have, you know, called maybe like a Green New Deal could do something like this that kind of tries to offer big universal public goods under the banner of climate action.

06:30.400 --> 06:40.900
But I also argue we need a much more focused strategy in the labor movement and the union movement that is oriented towards transforming these industrial sectors that are at the core of the climate crisis.

06:40.900 --> 06:47.200
And in the book, I take a pretty narrow argument that really the core sector that we should be looking at is electricity.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.500
You know, most experts say if we're going to solve climate change, it goes through the electricity sector.

06:52.500 --> 06:59.300
We're going to have to clean up the electric sector, then electrify a lot of things that don't currently run on electricity.

06:59.300 --> 07:10.500
So I focus on the fact that, you know, the electricity sector happens to be quite, you know, in the United States, at least quite unionized, like a high level of union density, comparatively speaking.

07:10.600 --> 07:25.400
And so therefore, there's there's already an organized base in this sector that could be at least if not, you know, you know, socialists talk about like people get jobs in strategic sectors and try to build a fighting kind of union movement in those sectors.

07:25.900 --> 07:37.000
But even if not, like if you're just an ordinary climate activist, you should really be thinking about how to align with and and get these unions on board for a kind of climate action.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.200
Because I think it's kind of socialism 101.

07:40.200 --> 07:50.300
If you want to transform a certain system of production, the best, most powerful actors to do that are the workers themselves who have the knowledge of that sector.

07:50.300 --> 07:58.100
They have the skills that they understand materially how it works, but also they have the power because they do the work in that sector.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.700
So again, the book kind of narrowly focuses on electricity.

08:01.700 --> 08:16.300
I think since I've written it, I've realized that really when we're talking about decarbonization, we're talking about a massive project of rebuilding our infrastructure and totally, you know, changing the material system under which we live.

08:16.700 --> 08:23.000
And I think that can appeal to a much broader suite of unions and workers in the United States.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.600
We call them the building trades, the people that would build new transit systems, new housing systems, new and new electricity systems.

08:30.600 --> 08:43.500
All of those workers, you know, pipe fitters, welders, construction workers, those are going to be the people who would really benefit from a kind of big, you know, investment program to solve the climate crisis.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.200
Now, the problem is we're not doing that, right?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.700
We're not doing this big investment program.

08:48.700 --> 08:55.300
So a lot of times those those unions don't really see much in it for them when it comes to climate action.

08:55.400 --> 09:00.800
In fact, most climate action gets constructed as about shutting down particular industries.

09:00.800 --> 09:05.000
So in any event, that's a long answer, but that's kind of an overview of the argument.

09:05.000 --> 09:21.900
The book really has three parts, you know, the capitalist class that's responsible for the crisis, the owners of production, the people that profit off it, the professional class, which is where the climate movement is housed in this kind of minority of society, not particularly powerful.

09:21.900 --> 09:29.600
And then a working class kind of strategy for climate that that I suggest might have a chance of winning.

09:29.600 --> 09:45.400
And when it comes to winning over the working class for such a project, the core argument or at least what I saw as one of the main points of the argument that you make is that you will have to have an attractive offer for the working class.

09:46.400 --> 09:58.400
And what I really liked about the way that you framed it is that, and this is something that I would absolutely get behind, is that the essential core of this offer is security.

09:58.400 --> 10:08.000
So it's a form of existential security that takes off the burden of everyday life, the burden of this struggle that is put upon us all.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.600
And I absolutely can get behind this.

10:11.600 --> 10:30.700
My question would be, you tried to differentiate between sectors that need to grow, sectors that need to de-grow, and you kind of argue against, for example, the de-growth movement that, at least in the way that you presented, argues for a total de-growth.

10:30.700 --> 10:41.800
So could you maybe explain this relationship between the offer on the one side and the question of growth or no growth or growth in which sector?

10:41.800 --> 10:51.100
Yeah. Yeah, you know, the more I have these debates and talk to de-growth people, the more I realize and they realize that we all agree, actually.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.900
Well, not on everything, but we all agree that we actually want to grow certain parts of the economy and de-grow others.

11:00.900 --> 11:06.800
And so one of my frustrations is really just the word de-growth.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.600
It's not actually what they're talking about.

11:08.600 --> 11:20.700
You know, like they talk about really investing in what they call universal public services, exactly what you just said, giving people material security, guaranteeing people in our country.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.400
We dream of guaranteed health care.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.400
We dream of, you know, housing as a human right.

11:26.400 --> 11:36.700
You know, on the climate crisis, there have been organizers in energy and environmental justice that have called that we really should have electricity as a human right.

11:36.700 --> 11:48.800
Like these types of there are some basic needs that working class people struggle to acquire that could be guaranteed and offer more security, as you said.

11:48.800 --> 12:03.000
In general, you know, de-growth has really, they take a, I call it in the book, I think a territorial or geographical approach to what needs to grow and what needs to de-grow where they say,

12:03.000 --> 12:11.100
you know, it's really the global north, the rich countries that need to de-grow so that we can allow the poor global south countries to grow.

12:11.200 --> 12:21.900
And to me, that takes a conflict, a geographical conflict between north and south, which is actually, from my point of view, a class conflict that we need to think about.

12:21.900 --> 12:31.400
And, you know, there's extremely poor people in the global north that need to see tremendous growth in their access to food, to, you know, you know,

12:31.400 --> 12:38.400
hookworm has returned to parts of the south in the United States where they just don't even have basic sanitation.

12:38.500 --> 12:47.100
And so these are diseases we thought we eradicated in the early 20th century, and they're returning right now to like places in Mississippi and Alabama.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.800
And likewise, in the global south, there are capitalists.

12:49.800 --> 12:56.300
There are very, very rich people who live in immense luxury, have tremendous power over resources.

12:56.300 --> 13:05.200
So I like to take a class approach that says we need to, you know, yes, there's some sectors we want to grow and de-grow,

13:05.200 --> 13:10.100
but actually what we want to do is de-grow capitalist control over our economy.

13:10.100 --> 13:20.200
We want to de-grow the capitalist class and we want to see a lot of growth and expansion and what the working class can expect and the offers you say.

13:20.200 --> 13:30.100
Because I think what defines capitalism for a lot of working class people is just insecurity, stress, anxiety about about meeting basic needs.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.100
And I've used this quote a lot.

13:32.200 --> 13:42.100
It really, I think, hit the nail on the head when in France you had the yellow vest movement chanting in the streets that politicians care about the end of the world,

13:42.100 --> 13:52.200
but we're trying to get to the end of the month, you know, like the inability of climate politics to really address those end of month struggles.

13:52.200 --> 14:01.100
And again, I think de-growth advocates that do strongly talk about offering universal public services.

14:01.100 --> 14:05.000
That's a good point of agreement, I would say.

14:05.000 --> 14:18.200
I mean, just as a note, I recently saw a tweet by Jason Hickel on Twitter where he very, very explicitly argued for joining like the de-growth movement and the class struggle movement.

14:18.200 --> 14:30.100
And when reading through the threat, I thought like, okay, well, there's not that much disagreement between what you describe in your book and what Jason Hickel was trying to argue for in this threat.

14:30.100 --> 14:36.000
And this might be a development that has taken place over a certain period of time in the last years.

14:36.000 --> 14:47.600
Maybe there had been more folk politic-ish de-growth elements dominating the movement before, but I think this is heavily changing, actually.

14:47.600 --> 14:59.700
I'm right now in the process of co-editing a volume on democratic economic planning together with Christoph Sorg and there's Matthias Schmelzer, Elena Offerberthe and CÃ©dric Durand together writing a chapter

15:00.500 --> 15:06.100
which will address democratic planning in connection to de-growth.

15:06.100 --> 15:11.000
So I think these things are kind of coming together.

15:11.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, and I've actually brought this up before where Jason Hickel sometimes defined de-growth as a democratic planned reduction of material throughput in the global north or something like that.

15:25.100 --> 15:31.900
But to me, those three words, democratic planned reduction, to me really raised some serious questions.

15:31.900 --> 15:37.000
Let's absolutely get into that because I'm interested in the questions.

15:37.000 --> 15:47.900
To me, if you're already saying there's a reduction, you're actually foreclosing the democratic part because I think the democratic part is for socialists.

15:48.000 --> 15:56.100
The most important part, which is that we democratically debate over, you know, we call socialism production for social need.

15:56.100 --> 16:14.200
So the question of what we need collectively as a society and what is enough for a good life and what types of sectors we do want to expand, this is up to democratic deliberation.

16:14.200 --> 16:26.300
And whether or not we would want to reduce the amount of material and energy use in that plan democratic like that shouldn't already be determined.

16:26.300 --> 16:43.100
You know, again, like there's a lot of poverty around the world and we very much if we were, you know, my socialist perspective is this idea that capitalism actually limits us incredibly in what we can produce and what we can do for people

16:43.100 --> 16:47.600
because it it only allows us to produce what's profitable for investors.

16:47.600 --> 17:02.100
So if we were actually come into a place where we had democratic planning overproduction and we're going to already say, well, we have to reduce how much how much material and energy use we use that like that doesn't seem particularly democratic.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.500
And to me, it's a real challenge.

17:04.500 --> 17:23.500
And again, I'll go back to this north south thing like a lot of the the problem of poverty in the global south, but also, as I'd say, again, in the global north is is not really a matter of just taking some energy consumption up in the north and bringing it down to the to the south and transferring it.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.900
Right. It's a it's about a fundamental lack of infrastructure.

17:26.900 --> 17:34.300
And so, you know, there are close to a billion people around the planet that have no access to electricity.

17:34.300 --> 17:40.200
And the World Bank thinks we'll just like give each little hut a solar panel and a battery and call it done.

17:40.200 --> 17:48.100
But no, I think, again, if we're a socialist, we would want to build like an actually viable electricity grid all over the world.

17:48.100 --> 17:53.400
Like people deserve the type of electricity that we just take for granted.

17:53.400 --> 18:02.400
Right. And people need modern sanitation infrastructure, you know, like sewage treatment, like plumbing, like these types of things.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.000
And again, you don't take that from the north.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.500
You just you have to build the infrastructure in the first place.

18:08.500 --> 18:21.300
And like I said before, it's, you know, there's some fundamental infrastructure problems even in a rich country like the United States and the south where people don't have sanitation.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.300
The problem of climate change is we have to rebuild an entirely new grid system.

18:25.300 --> 18:30.400
So it's not again, it's not like you can just take from this preexisting material and energy use.

18:30.400 --> 18:35.600
So so, again, I do think, oddly, it's capitalism that limits us.

18:35.600 --> 18:48.900
And if we were to take control over production, we would want to be free to decide collectively how much we need, how much we need to grow or how much we need to degrow certain things and all those sorts of things.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.600
OK, a lot of questions coming up there.

18:51.600 --> 18:59.500
The first one would be, I mean, to a certain degree in the way that you framed it right now and I think to a higher degree, even though in the book,

18:59.500 --> 19:18.500
I'd say that the way that you use a certain idea of progress as a goal, as a universal goal, I'd say, isn't that like in the same way as you rightly point out the predetermined closure of the democratic process?

19:18.500 --> 19:37.000
If you say we need shrinking, isn't that kind of equally predetermining a certain idea of how, in this case, Western ideas of progress are situated as something to be wanted for other areas of the world?

19:37.000 --> 19:45.500
And because this would be equally problematic because I like the point about, OK, we shouldn't predetermine the question of shrinking or not shrinking.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.400
But this would equally apply in this case.

19:47.400 --> 20:02.700
Absolutely. Yeah. And I shouldn't assume that much of the impoverished millions around the world, you know, would vote or would collectively decide to build, you know, modern electricity and sanitation systems.

20:02.700 --> 20:13.700
But I would wager that those populations would love to have the kind of development that, again, we take for granted.

20:13.700 --> 20:20.200
And most people around the world today are not isolated from modern infrastructure systems.

20:20.200 --> 20:26.700
They see they have connections to what it looks like and what it can offer to populations.

20:26.700 --> 20:45.700
So I think it's it's also very problematic to kind of assume that like rural poor people in the global south want to sort of remain sort of in this sort of like somewhat romantic idea of being in touch with the land and living in communal harmony.

20:45.700 --> 20:52.200
And I think most people would love to have more secure access to electricity, modern sanitation systems.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.200
But that's again, that's just a guess.

20:55.200 --> 21:15.200
You would want there to be robust, political, democratic, you know, systems that could again collectively decide what kind of life and what kind of infrastructure people think are required to to actually get rid of this type of poverty and deprivation that exists.

21:15.700 --> 21:35.700
Because I would argue, I mean, there's a obviously there's a large span between, you know, the idealization of like in touch with nature, communal life ish ideas and like highly modernist progressivism, like on the other end of the scale, so to speak.

21:35.700 --> 21:39.200
So there's a huge range between those, I'd say.

21:39.200 --> 21:54.200
And I think it kind of also brings us to a question that I had when engaging with your work, and that is you already mentioned that you think that the predetermined limit would be a way of undercutting the democratic process, so to speak.

21:54.200 --> 22:05.200
And then, I mean, immediately the other question pops up, whether or not there are certain like metabolic limits that need to be taken into account.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.200
I would guess you'd agree that there are.

22:09.200 --> 22:19.200
And then the question would be how to incorporate this into the process without predetermining what should be done and what should not be done.

22:19.200 --> 22:26.200
And I think a certain area within your proposal made this pop up again and again.

22:26.200 --> 22:40.200
And that was this question of like unlimited energy supply, because you put this as a possibility equal to universal basic services in other areas of life for housing, stuff like that.

22:40.200 --> 22:48.200
But in terms of housing, for example, universal basic services wouldn't mean that we have unlimited housing.

22:48.200 --> 22:56.200
It would mean that we have like adequately comfortable housing for everybody as a right, but not unlimited.

22:56.200 --> 23:10.200
So in an equal sense, if you argue for unlimited energy supply, this would also kind of hit the wall at some point when it comes to the question of limits of metabolism, metabolism.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.200
So how do you bring these two together?

23:13.200 --> 23:31.200
So first thing, I think, I think, again, a democratic collective sort of planning would have to take into account the ecological constraints or limits under which we live.

23:31.200 --> 23:48.200
And so you would hope, again, that that democratic planning process would be informed by robust science that is sort of trying to ascertain, you know, what actually we can take from nature without destroying it.

23:48.200 --> 24:05.200
Right. And and again, I just would point out that we live in a world today where that kind of worse scientific understanding of limits and forming production just does not happen at all because productions organized for profit and very short term profits.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.200
And so there's there's very little of that going on today.

24:08.200 --> 24:31.200
So I do think degrowth people and environmentalists generally take a pretty sort of rigid vision of limits where they, you know, like there's been this science that's come out on like these planetary boundaries that are, you know, oftentimes people represent them as these entirely fixed static things.

24:31.200 --> 24:36.200
But, you know, there's a lot of debate on the nature of these limits and these boundaries.

24:36.200 --> 24:51.200
And one thing you can say about capitalism is that there have there have been serious limits, metabolic limits that because of capitalism's relentless kind of technological change have just been shot through.

24:52.200 --> 25:00.200
You know, I studied nitrogen and like there was a lot of people worried about the limits of nitrogen and soil fertility in the late 19th century.

25:00.200 --> 25:06.200
And then we came up with Haber-Bosch and it's just it's completely not not an issue anymore.

25:06.200 --> 25:20.200
So, again, a more and you can call it progressivist or whatever, but a more sort of classical socialist perspective is that, first of all, capitalism limits us entirely like incredibly again, but also that

25:20.200 --> 25:36.200
that limits are not fixed or static, that they can be superseded through technical, you know, to say it in the most crude way, developing the productive forces to to come up with new ways of producing things.

25:36.200 --> 25:47.200
So let's look at the question of energy, which I think you're right is fundamentally limited, particularly when you look at our energy system now that's still to this day.

25:47.200 --> 25:55.200
And again, we're losing the climate struggle because for about the last 20 years, the global share of energy and fossil fuels has remained static.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.200
It's about 80 percent. Right.

25:57.200 --> 26:05.200
And 80 percent of that means 80 percent of our global primary energy consumption comes from a limited resource.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.200
Right. That's there's a finite amount of fossil fuels.

26:08.200 --> 26:16.200
And that is a really serious limit to any kind of civilization that wants to base their energy on that source.

26:16.200 --> 26:23.200
And there are other sources of energy that have, you know, debatable limits.

26:23.200 --> 26:43.200
And, you know, some have argued that if you want to take a pro renewables perspective, like the amount of sun and wind that is harnessable on the earth on any given day is about, you know, many times over the level of global energy demand at all times.

26:43.200 --> 26:51.200
So there's there, you know, when you look at renewables, there's this kind of abundance that could be harnessed in particular ways.

26:51.200 --> 27:05.200
There are other, again, technical options that, you know, you know, people dream of nuclear fusion power, which would create a kind of inexhaustible energy.

27:05.200 --> 27:10.200
So I don't want to be the person that said, oh, we have limitless energy.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.200
No, I think it's contextual.

27:13.200 --> 27:22.200
Right. And right now we're in a big pickle, a big problem because we are rooted in an energy regime that is limited fossil fuels.

27:22.200 --> 27:38.200
But we could I think, again, I'm pretty optimistic that with social control over the means of production, we could shift towards a more flexible energy regime that could provision everyone's needs at a comfortable level.

27:38.200 --> 27:46.200
Now, the other thing you brought up is and again, this is a good example I've been using lately about why context matters.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.200
We are in Quebec right now.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.200
Right. And I have a friend who lived in Quebec, I believe in Montreal.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.200
And she joked to me and she studied electricity.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.200
She wrote an incredible book.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.200
I met her. I should name her. Her name is Gretchen Bakke.

28:00.200 --> 28:04.200
She wrote a book called The Grid, which is really I learned so much about electricity.

28:04.200 --> 28:12.200
And she joked to me once that here in Quebec and if I'm right, she lived in Montreal for a while here in Quebec.

28:12.200 --> 28:28.200
They have so much cheap hydro, so much cheap hydro power that hydro Quebec that everyone just has like totally inefficient space heaters in their homes, like these like baseboard electric resistance heaters.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
And they just crank it up.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
You know, it's cold here.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.200
They just crank it up because it's just they have so much energy.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.200
It's just abundant energy.

28:35.200 --> 28:41.200
And, you know, hydro has a lot of land use problems and some emissions associated with it.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.200
But it's it's also seen as somewhat clean and carbon free.

28:44.200 --> 28:52.200
So people have this sort of abundant clean energy and they're just that, you know, it feels like limitless to in that context.

28:52.200 --> 28:58.200
And it's not having a huge impact on climate change that people are just like churning this electric heat.

28:58.200 --> 29:06.200
And but then I was in Germany actually this fall and I talked to a friend who who kind of gave a different example.

29:06.200 --> 29:22.200
If you have like the DDR in East Germany that actually was taking this, you know, whatever somewhat heavy handed state socialist investment in much more efficient forms of living like collective housing and public transit.

29:22.200 --> 29:29.200
And, you know, environmentalists would all be supportive of this kind of much more low energy use, compact cities, compact living.

29:29.200 --> 29:37.200
But and so they had a much more like not like these Quebec people, like, you know, just inefficiently wasting energy.

29:38.200 --> 29:52.200
But but but because the DDR was basically hooked up to a grid powered by coal, dirty, dirty coal, that that the environmental impact of that more efficient way of living was way worse than this.

29:52.200 --> 29:57.200
This is just like excessive wasteful Quebec energy use.

29:57.200 --> 30:07.200
So again, the context really matters, you know, when you have clean, abundant energy, you can have much more freedom to do whatever you want.

30:07.200 --> 30:17.200
When you have dirty, even if it's dirty, abundant energy and you're trying to use it efficiently, you can still have a horrible impact on the environment.

30:18.200 --> 30:32.200
Let's maybe dig a little bit deeper into this consumption side of things, because I think you make a very good point when pointing out that it's not about individualized guilt.

30:32.200 --> 30:54.200
So that's a technique of power, maybe, so to speak, that is being deployed upon us by basically by the capitalist class in all types of ways in order maybe to distract from what should happen, which is questioning the ownership of means of production, as you rightly point out.

30:54.200 --> 31:00.200
So I think you make a very fair point when it comes to that, and you can talk about that as well.

31:00.200 --> 31:09.200
But I would like to attach something to this point that you're making there, while you're rightly pointing out that this individualized guilt is not the way to go.

31:10.200 --> 31:26.200
I also am asking myself if it's the right way to go to stick to what is, from a critical perspective, being called a consumerist society.

31:26.200 --> 31:43.200
And I get the point that you're saying, okay, for a whole bunch of people, they are absolutely not in the position where one could rightly point towards less consumption because they are simply poor and need a higher living standard.

31:43.200 --> 32:00.200
But still, there's this element of a certain type of consumerist culture that is also part of a certain type of fetish that we are being fed for means of profiting.

32:00.200 --> 32:09.200
So I think a simple linear continuation of this consumerist mindset is equally not the way to go.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.200
And maybe you could steer us through these areas.

32:13.200 --> 32:31.200
Yeah, for some reason, my argument sometimes gets interpreted as, because we're not criticizing consumption, we want to just maintain and keep American-style mass consumption as it is.

32:31.200 --> 32:51.200
And then seize production so that we can just extend American-style consumption to the whole world, which would not be a very socialist perspective because, again, I would argue that American-style consumption is, and I talk about this in the book, where I call it privatized provisioning.

32:51.200 --> 33:06.200
It's a highly inefficient, privatized mode of living where you have people spread about and reliance upon single-family private housing and private automobiles.

33:06.200 --> 33:14.200
And this is not a rational use of resources from a socialist planning perspective in my view.

33:14.200 --> 33:22.200
And that a socialist perspective would obviously want to collectivize consumption in all these ways that would bring people together and collective housing.

33:22.200 --> 33:29.200
And you said you live in Vienna and collective housing, so this is something I think is inspiring.

33:29.200 --> 33:43.200
And I think the Green New Deal vision, when it was very ascendant in the United States with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others, it was this vision of public luxury.

33:43.200 --> 34:03.200
So this is kind of like, I think, a socialist vision is, again, more sort of actually changing the conversation over what is the good life, over what do we need as a society, and restructuring not just production, but all of society.

34:03.200 --> 34:10.200
So, again, production for social need is not just about productions, about what we need on the consumption side.

34:10.200 --> 34:26.200
And that said, again, there are parts of the American way of life, like, again, secure electricity access, modern food refrigeration type services, sanitation, plumbing.

34:26.200 --> 34:31.200
These are things, I think, that everyone, if they want, if they should have.

34:31.200 --> 34:48.200
I mean, maybe just a quick question. Coming from the degrowth perspective, I mean, one big point when it comes to what you sometimes seem to slightly hint towards when it comes to technical fixes and how far they might reach.

34:48.200 --> 34:56.200
And you pointed towards how much energy wind and solar might potentially produce stuff like that.

34:56.200 --> 35:03.200
From a degrowth perspective, the argument which would then be broad is this question of decoupling, I think.

35:04.200 --> 35:27.200
So it might be that there is so much sun energy coming onto the earth, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we can produce mechanisms for the collection of this energy in a way that leads to a point where you will have the decoupling of growth and raising destruction of the earth, so to speak.

35:27.200 --> 35:39.200
So whether or not this is possible, it's actually a crucial point when it comes to this question of where to imagine and negotiate limits, let's say.

35:39.200 --> 36:08.200
Yeah, and unfortunately, I think the decoupling conversation is always sort of in relationship to GDP growth, which is, again, a kind of statistical construction of a capitalist economy is growing as healthy, but to me obscures that it's really about capitalist profiting and investing that leads to GDP growth.

36:08.200 --> 36:23.200
So it's sort of like a proxy measure of whether or not capitalists are investing in hiring people and accumulating capital, and that's kind of what really drives a capitalist society.

36:23.200 --> 36:41.200
And so, again, we would not want a socialist society to be basically measured by GDP growth, so the question of whether or not you can decouple from GDP growth is not particularly important from a socialist perspective.

36:41.200 --> 36:54.200
The question is, again, can we provide for social needs without destroying the ecological conditions? And I think, again, I'm pretty optimistic that we could.

36:54.200 --> 37:19.200
We could, and there's lots of examples of how, again, that case of big, cheap, abundant hydro providing for tremendous amounts of energy consumption without the same kinds of impacts you would have if you were to be channeling a coal-based form of consumption on that.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
So again, it really matters.

37:21.200 --> 37:36.200
I mean, but one element of your argument is that there's not hydro energy everywhere equally, so then the follow-up question would be, I mean, in the case of solar, for example, there are certain elements that go into the production of these panels and stuff like that.

37:36.200 --> 37:46.200
And all these things are not abundant in a way that we'll be able to collect all of the energy for like quadrupled energy consumption of the Earth.

37:46.200 --> 38:09.200
So there is a relation that goes beyond the question of GDP growth, but relates to the question of whether or not the production of energy has follow-up environmental costs, not monetary costs, but environmental costs that need to be taken into account when thinking about how abundant the use of energy can at the end be.

38:09.200 --> 38:22.200
Yeah, I'm actually very not as optimistic about renewable solar and wind energy as I suggested before for a whole lot of other reasons.

38:22.200 --> 38:33.200
But one thing I can say that's good about them is, you know, with fossil fuels, you dig up this stuff from the Earth and you burn it and it's gone.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.200
You know, it's like this combustion-based energy system.

38:36.200 --> 38:48.200
But with these minerals you speak of, and they're significant, you do dig them up, you put them into these panels or the turbines, and these systems work for decades.

38:48.200 --> 39:02.200
You know, so there is a different type of material flow that goes into these renewable systems than goes into the fossil fuel economy that needs to be stated clearly.

39:02.200 --> 39:10.200
But you're right, you know, I'm more concerned honestly about the land use that it takes for these resources.

39:10.200 --> 39:16.200
One good thing about fossil fuel is you dig deep into the Earth to get it.

39:16.200 --> 39:21.200
You don't take up a whole lot of territory or land to get that energy, incredible energy.

39:21.200 --> 39:28.200
Energy scholars call it power density, how much power you're generating per square meter of territory.

39:28.200 --> 39:34.200
And fossil fuels are pretty good for giving you tremendous energy with not using much land.

39:34.200 --> 39:43.200
And so we to just think we're just going to like basically like, you know, there's just been a recent estimate that to get to net zero,

39:43.200 --> 39:52.200
the United States has to put solar panels on the territory that would equal like several states combined, you know, wind turbines over several, you know,

39:52.200 --> 39:57.200
like we're talking about huge to act like we can just like do that.

39:58.200 --> 40:05.200
We're just like plopping things down on tremendous territory like that's a that's a huge concern.

40:05.200 --> 40:20.200
But again, I feel like this idea that we can decide ahead of time like what these particular material constraints are is not is a historical and not

40:20.200 --> 40:26.200
in line with what we know how history has shown, which is when there are limits to some certain resource there,

40:26.200 --> 40:36.200
there are technical changes that vastly expand those limits and often just sort of shoot through them.

40:36.200 --> 40:46.200
So if there's a particular mineral that is becoming scarce for the energy economy, there could be a way to find a different one.

40:46.200 --> 40:57.200
And if those again, I think the more serious question is if the extraction of those minerals are starting to really destroy the kind of more broader ecological systems

40:57.200 --> 41:08.200
that we rely on to survive, like water systems and, you know, basically, you know, even let's talk about biodiversity conservation.

41:08.200 --> 41:18.200
Like then, you know, then you can start to talk about, you know, scaling back that kind of extraction to not, you know, gobble up ecology as a whole.

41:18.200 --> 41:29.200
But I think, again, it again, if we had more social control, this kind of planning would have to always be responding dynamically to ecological problems over here

41:29.200 --> 41:42.200
and concerns and changing the production system in accordance in that sometimes this degrowth debate is often about like sort of deciding once and for all if decoupling is possible or not.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.200
But again, I think a lot of it's going to be contextual.

41:46.200 --> 41:55.200
Still wondering a bit how much you rely on this idea of possible technical fixes that might come about or might not.

41:55.200 --> 42:01.200
But you kind of pivot to the point of we'll have to see and decide democratically.

42:01.200 --> 42:06.200
So I have two bigger things that I wanted to ask you.

42:06.200 --> 42:13.200
Let's start with the science thing, because you kind of hinted towards that area in your last answer as well.

42:13.200 --> 42:26.200
Well, I mean, one thing that really comes off as weird for me within the larger climate movement is and maybe I'm too generalizing here.

42:26.200 --> 42:35.200
But anyway, is the like implicit scientism that is carried along oftentimes within the arguments.

42:35.200 --> 42:43.200
And I mean, the general like, listen to the science slogan, it never really worked for me.

42:43.200 --> 42:53.200
And I always wondered if it's just a strategic way of trying to use an appeal of authority coming from science,

42:53.200 --> 43:03.200
which I would understand for like a youth movement that in the eyes of the broader society is like looked down upon as well.

43:03.200 --> 43:08.200
But do they know these kids, blah, blah, blah, blah, which is a stupid thing to say.

43:08.200 --> 43:20.200
And then to kind of trying to use some of the like societal authority of science in trying to strategically make your point.

43:20.200 --> 43:27.200
This is something I would probably understand for a moment, you know, to carry along.

43:27.200 --> 43:38.200
But in general, I think it's really problematic to base your movement and your point on this type of appealing to the science in singular,

43:38.200 --> 43:46.200
as if, as you said before in one of your answers, as if these things were set in stone through some objective fact.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.200
And because that's not the way it goes.

43:48.200 --> 43:55.200
It's not science if anybody tells you that it cannot be any different, because that's the essence of science.

43:55.200 --> 44:02.200
These are competing knowledges that that fight for the interpretation of things, you know.

44:02.200 --> 44:07.200
So I'm just interested in your in your thoughts about this.

44:07.200 --> 44:17.200
Well, in the book, I argue that it's it's a very particularly form of class politics on the part of what I call the professional class.

44:18.200 --> 44:28.200
I've talked about the professional managerial class, which for that class, like education, meritocracy, sort of being smart are kind of like very important,

44:28.200 --> 44:36.200
kind of self-identity, identity defining kind of aspects of your entire sort of orientation towards the world.

44:36.200 --> 44:50.200
So in that sense, I argue that that really looking at climate change as a issue of the science and what the science is saying becomes sort of existential to these highly educated people who really take science seriously.

44:50.200 --> 45:06.200
And and so, you know, what what I argue is that that, you know, clearly the the people in control of the energy system saw pretty early on the 1990s that if the science became clearer on climate change,

45:06.200 --> 45:10.200
then society might want to do something about it, which would attack their interests.

45:10.200 --> 45:26.200
So the fact that the fossil fuel industry started funding these sort of skeptical scientists who would be uncertain about the reality of climate change was a in my view, like a media strategy, a kind of power strategy on the part of the fossil fuel industry.

45:26.200 --> 45:39.200
And but this kind of offended the kind of professional class climate activists so much that they wanted to focus totally on the fossil fuel industry's role in sowing climate denial, climate uncertainty.

45:39.200 --> 45:56.200
And to me, in many ways, sort of made a kind of mountain out of a molehill where, you know, most of what the fossil fuel industry does is, you know, materially invest in fossil fuel energy projects that they want to generate profit off profits off.

45:56.200 --> 46:02.200
And they also are spending much more of their time organizing political power.

46:02.200 --> 46:09.200
You know, the sort of big climate villains in the U.S. are the Charles and David Koch, the Koch brothers.

46:09.200 --> 46:22.200
And they literally set up something called the American Legislative Exchange Council that literally wrote legislation and bills for state level legislatures that they would just send them the bill and then they would pass it.

46:22.200 --> 46:28.200
And so they were, you know, donating to campaigns amassing huge political power.

46:28.200 --> 46:31.200
You know, on the side, you know, funding some science denial, right?

46:31.200 --> 46:36.200
But the liberal climate people are just like all they want to talk about is the science denial.

46:36.200 --> 46:42.200
And they aren't seeing that this isn't really a struggle over facts and science.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.200
It's really a struggle over power and political power in particular.

46:45.200 --> 46:52.200
And you can point out how dastardly these fossil fuel interests are for denying the science.

46:52.200 --> 46:56.200
But that's not necessarily going to give you any more power.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.200
I think I quoted that.

46:58.200 --> 46:59.200
What's his last name?

46:59.200 --> 47:02.200
He wrote a book called Hegemony How To.

47:02.200 --> 47:07.200
And he has this great line where he says, right does not equal might.

47:07.200 --> 47:13.200
Like being right, being correct scientifically does not equal political might or power.

47:14.200 --> 47:22.200
And for this class of people, they kind of sometimes collapse into this sort of liberal worldview where we're just going to debate the ideas

47:22.200 --> 47:28.200
and come to a consensus about the truth about climate change and then we're going to act.

47:28.200 --> 47:33.200
And if it weren't for this horrific denial, we would be acting already.

47:33.200 --> 47:36.200
But again, even if 100 percent of Americans believed in the science,

47:36.200 --> 47:41.200
that does not guarantee we're going to embark on a process of shifting off of fossil fuels.

47:42.200 --> 47:50.200
So, yeah, again, I think it creates a pretty ineffectual type of politics that isn't really concerned with power.

47:50.200 --> 47:56.200
It's about concerned with being smart and being right, which is not going to win.

47:56.200 --> 48:05.200
OK, we will get to the class struggle after one last question on how to situate your ideas.

48:05.200 --> 48:19.200
Because I think that the most difficult element within your argument for me to understand why you stick to it or why you bring it forward was this

48:19.200 --> 48:22.200
was this notion of the good Anthropocene.

48:22.200 --> 48:34.200
And the reason why I'm skeptical is that I don't think that it's a good idea to reinstate the human as a sovereign over nature.

48:34.200 --> 48:41.200
Again, because this is an element of modernism, frankly, to to be overcome, I think,

48:41.200 --> 48:50.200
and that it's that it's a nucleus of the the way in which we relate to nature in an in an extractive logic.

48:50.200 --> 49:01.200
Because, I mean, there's a like closeness between the two between the idea of sovereignty over nature and this logic of extractivism.

49:01.200 --> 49:11.200
And within this idea of good Anthropocene, to me, it seems as if it's a bit of a weird logic that says, OK,

49:11.200 --> 49:19.200
we just need to get into control even more and then use it cleverly and then everything will work out.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.200
But that's not how it works.

49:21.200 --> 49:30.200
I think in order to really bring about the change that you argue for, there will need to be a change in position as well on the part of humans.

49:30.200 --> 49:40.200
And the change in position would be a change towards more and more relational understanding when it comes to nature,

49:40.200 --> 49:50.200
instead of this dichotomy between nature, culture and the sovereign, the human as a sovereign that controls nature, even in a good way.

49:50.200 --> 50:02.200
I think another element where you point towards is this Marxian notion of the how is it called Bonaparte familias or something like that?

50:02.200 --> 50:03.200
Yeah.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
Bono's part of familias.

50:04.200 --> 50:12.200
And I mean, come on, this is not the relation we should have towards nature, because it's a hierarchical relation towards nature.

50:12.200 --> 50:19.200
And it implies a certain way of subjugation, so to speak.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure.

50:21.200 --> 50:27.200
You know, the good Anthropocene is a phrase from an article by Lee Phillips and Mikhail Rozhevsky.

50:27.200 --> 50:31.200
And I'm not sure how wedded I am to that frame.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.200
You do.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.200
I cite them.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
Yeah.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.200
But mostly because they're calling for planning.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
Right.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.200
And planning against the market.

50:39.200 --> 50:51.200
And so what I would say is that, again, we live in a world today where we just are helpless.

50:51.200 --> 50:55.200
We're actually out of control over our relationship to nature, right?

50:55.200 --> 51:06.200
We just see the world burning and we act like we can't do anything about it because there's this thing called the economy that is allowed to just be this naturalized market that just does its thing.

51:06.200 --> 51:12.200
If the market says, like it said in 2022, that fossil fuels are as profitable as they've really ever been.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.200
You know, coal right now is experiencing a boom in profits.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.200
I mean, how are we allowing that?

51:17.200 --> 51:19.200
We're just saying, well, stocks are up.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.200
That's what the market says.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.200
And we just say we can't control it.

51:23.200 --> 51:31.200
Right. And so the impulse to plan means we want to take control over our relationship to nature and plan that relationship.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.200
Now, I totally hear you.

51:33.200 --> 51:39.200
There's this there is longstanding modernist Western problems with the kind of, you know, it goes all the way back to the Bible.

51:39.200 --> 51:43.200
This could like subjugate nature, control it.

51:43.200 --> 51:48.200
I don't have, you know, I'm not wedded to that subjugating vision.

51:48.200 --> 51:55.200
I would maybe frame it as one of more focused on stewardship, which I think that Marx quote is really about.

51:55.200 --> 52:00.200
Like we want to we want to be stewards of the earth and pass it on.

52:00.200 --> 52:08.200
I think he talks about passing on an earth to generation after generation in a good state and that.

52:08.200 --> 52:19.200
But, you know, I think being good stewards of the natural world, allowing biodiversity to thrive in ways it's not right now would require planning, right?

52:19.200 --> 52:23.200
Will require some sort of control over our economic system.

52:23.200 --> 52:32.200
And again, when it's necessary, limiting the economic activity in certain areas so that we can allow nature to thrive.

52:32.200 --> 52:49.200
And, you know, that's that's why I actually, you know, sometimes this sort of perspective that gets associated with eco modernism or eco, I find somewhat attractive because they actually say like we want things like dense cities

52:49.200 --> 52:53.200
where people live and like collective housing and dense public transit.

52:53.200 --> 53:03.200
We want this kind of efficient human living so that we can allow nature to thrive elsewhere, like free up land, free up biodiversity elsewhere.

53:03.200 --> 53:18.200
And that's why they advocate, you know, you know, again, like they advocate highly efficient industrial agriculture so that the land footprint of agriculture is very small so that there can be more land for nature and wilderness and biodiversity.

53:18.200 --> 53:29.200
And things like this. So I would take the position that, you know, the the more we can plan our economy, the more we can choose collectively.

53:29.200 --> 53:41.200
You know what? Again, broken record what we need, but also what we what kind of natural biodiverse world we also want to we want to exist.

53:41.200 --> 53:52.200
And, you know, we have like it or not, humans have consciousness and we can plan to, you know, we we've already shown we can we can have, you know, nature preserves.

53:52.200 --> 53:58.200
We can set aside nature if we want to. Right. And so bringing in planning is going to have a certain type of control.

53:58.200 --> 54:08.200
Now, while I probably would distance myself from the kind of hyper modernist sort of domineering subjugation vision, I would not.

54:08.200 --> 54:29.200
Again, I'm very much a defender of modernism in general in in Marx, too, you know, and socialists were really they, you know, in Marx's time, like they actually saw what modern industrialization was doing was creating a kind of productive capacity that didn't exist in human history.

54:29.200 --> 54:41.200
That prior to the Industrial Revolution, you know, Friedrich Engels would say, like, you know, class and poverty were material necessities because there just wasn't enough production to go around.

54:41.200 --> 54:58.200
And, you know, 90 plus percent of society lived through agricultural labor, really brutal forms of subjects talk about subjugation, brutal forms of slavery, serfdom and horrific subjugation where tiny minorities were able to live in this kind of luxury.

54:58.200 --> 55:19.200
So what the what capitalism, they argued what capitalism does is it develops production to such a crazy level that we for the first time in human history have the possibility of abolishing poverty and and again, really planning and choosing our relationship to nature in a much more conscious and careful way.

55:19.200 --> 55:32.200
And that and also like it gives the productive capacity is so high that it at least creates the possibility that we could live in a society where people have way more time than they've ever had.

55:32.200 --> 55:44.200
You know, again, agrarian societies were very labor intensive and people didn't have a lot of time. Our capitalist society, people are always exhausted and stretched thin and not having enough time.

55:44.200 --> 56:03.200
So the vision of socialism as one of free time really hinges on, you know, again, this this idea from Marx and socialists that industrial production systems have such high capacity that we could actually harness them in ways that free up society as a whole to have free time.

56:03.200 --> 56:11.200
And and and and more time also for that kind of nitty gritty collective democratic planning, which takes time. Right.

56:11.200 --> 56:29.200
And and so so definitely I wouldn't throw out the modernist baby with the with the domineering subjugating bathwater because I do think if you're you know, in the 19th century or early 20th century, if you were a Marxist or a socialist, you were a modernist.

56:29.200 --> 56:37.200
You were you you had this sort of progressive view that capitalism actually creates the material conditions for emancipation of all of humanity.

56:37.200 --> 56:45.200
And I think things are pretty dark right now, but I still kind of fundamentally believe that we live in a world that has that possibility still.

56:45.200 --> 56:54.200
OK, let's maybe dive a little into the question of how because we didn't talk too much about that yet.

56:54.200 --> 56:58.200
But yeah, it's a really, really, really, really important question.

56:58.200 --> 57:12.200
So, I mean, and that's like a strong base of your argument is that many of the movements might have interesting ideas and good values, so to speak.

57:12.200 --> 57:21.200
But we need more than that. We need an idea of how to get into positions of power that are able to bring about this change.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.200
Yeah. How do we get that?

57:23.200 --> 57:32.200
Well, again, it unfortunately, you know, we've lived in a society where capital has been all powerful for about five decades.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.200
We've called it neoliberalism.

57:35.200 --> 57:45.200
I've often quoted Adolf Reed, the socialist in the United States, often defines neoliberalism as capitalism without a labor opposition.

57:45.200 --> 58:00.200
And that's essentially what we had a really powerful labor working class movements, labor parties, political parties and labor unions that built up all this power in the 20th century.

58:00.200 --> 58:07.200
And by the 1970s, capital had basically got fed up and they crushed the power of those movements systematically.

58:07.200 --> 58:17.200
Right. And now we live in a society where capital is all powerful and working class movements are sort of animized and demobilized and all this stuff.

58:17.200 --> 58:25.200
But I come at this from a much, you know, again, a more traditional Marxist view that that argues that working class power is not only contingent.

58:25.200 --> 58:36.200
It is objective to a capitalist system that capitalism actually objectively creates this majority that lives in insecure material existence.

58:36.200 --> 58:43.200
In fact, capital requires that sort of production of a proletarianized, insecure population.

58:43.200 --> 58:47.200
Otherwise, people would not show up to work.

58:47.200 --> 58:56.200
So this sort of disciplining of the market that you have to work to starve really feeds into capital's power as a whole.

58:56.200 --> 59:04.200
But it also creates this huge majority of society that has this material interest in transformation.

59:04.200 --> 59:14.200
But that does not guarantee that that interest can be organized or that workers are even collectively conscious of that power that they have.

59:14.200 --> 59:21.200
And the other part is that workers obviously have power because they do the work and society depends on.

59:21.200 --> 59:30.200
We found out about this in the pandemic where we suddenly were talking about these essential workers and that society doesn't function unless these workers.

59:30.200 --> 59:46.200
And lo and behold, it was the most sort of precarious and seen as like disposable, often immigrant workers that do like the nitty gritty work of reproducing society and service sectors and health care sectors.

59:46.200 --> 59:53.200
And even then, you know, again, transit and manufacturing and these kind of people that keep society running.

59:53.200 --> 01:00:06.200
But those those people have tremendous power just by the fact that if they do go on strike, they can create a crisis and force elites to answer to those demands.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:14.200
I mean, we've seen this recently where in West Virginia in 2018, the teachers went on strike.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:21.200
They shut down the entire state school system. They created a whole crisis. We've learned in COVID how schools are so important to social reproduction.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.200
They shut down social reproduction and they won their demands in about two weeks in a red state.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.200
And that's power, right? That's power that workers have. And they didn't just do it by going on strike.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.200
They organized with parents and communities to kind of get them on board with this politics.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.200
It was fundamentally about really investing in education.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.200
Like they wanted smaller class sizes. They wanted more classroom space and things like this.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.200
You know, in the United States, rail workers threatened to go on strike this past fall.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:01:00.200
And it led the most powerful people in the administration to basically pull all-nighters to try to prevent this from happening because they know that I think they're actually terrified of what would happen

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:07.200
if these rail workers learned about their power. Like what if they did shut down the rail system in the height of the holiday season?

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:16.200
What would that do to the working class movement? This summer, we might have 350,000 UPS workers go on strike for a good contract.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.200
And again, we live in a country where strike activity just fell off a cliff in 1980.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.200
Like basically, strike activity was really high in the whole postwar period.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:32.200
It spiked in the 1970s. And then with this kind of neoliberal onslaught, it just fell off a cliff.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.200
And so one union leader told Jane McAlevey that strikes are like a muscle.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.200
If you don't use it, it kind of atrophies. You forget how to use this power.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:49.200
And so I do think workers were going to have to like relearn, reorganize that power.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:59.200
And so anyway, to me, like this leads to that, I think I mentioned before, this kind of two pronged strategy where in order to, you know,

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:05.200
I do think we're probably not going to win socialism like tomorrow, right?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:15.200
But we can win state power through, again, trying to harness this majoritarian power of the working class as the vast majority of society in the United States.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.200
In the United States, I use this measure that basically says about 63 percent.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.200
You take out the professionals, the managers, the small business people.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.200
You know, it's about two thirds of society that's really in this sort of broader working class, multiracial working class.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:41.200
And if you can start to construct a majoritarian politics that can appeal to that majority, you can maybe in a parliamentary democracy start to win state power.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.200
And to me, like and people like Andrea's mom have said the same Christian parenti.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:54.200
If you think about the scale of the climate crisis and what needs to be done at the speed we need it, it's hard to imagine you achieve all that without state power.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:00.200
You know, the state can not only invest in the new infrastructure, which states that's what states often do.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:07.200
They they build public infrastructure that society needs, that capital doesn't find profitable to invest in.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:11.200
But also states can discipline capital.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:21.200
States can can actually be, you know, can actually take a more confrontational approach toward the fossil fuel industry and start to really aggressively phase out that industry.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.200
So we've got to win state power.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.200
You know, we took a gambit at it with like this Bernie Sanders and that sort of crested.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:40.200
And so we're back into this real struggle of like of thinking about how we can build much more powerful movements that could harness state power in way more aggressive ways than the Inflation Reduction Act.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:49.200
Because again, that's that's what not to fall back on the science, but the science does say we need radical, rapid transformation of our energy systems.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:55.200
And so we're going to need a much more powerful movement to really channel the state in that way.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:01.200
But again, we also need a power, more powerful labor movement and union movement.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.200
And that's where I see really building up again.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.200
You know, if it's electricity unions or building trade unions, that's great for the climate crisis.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.200
But I think in a general sense, we just need a revived labor movement in general.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:21.200
So if it's teachers going on strike, if it's UPS workers going on strike, if it's grad students who just want a union at my university.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.200
Yay, grad students.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:39.200
You know, wherever it is, if it's Starbucks workers, wherever we're sort of rebuilding a fighting democratic labor movement that learns that when you collectively organize, you can you have power and you can force the boss or the capitalist to kind of bend to your demands.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.200
Like that's the kind of movement that we need to rebuild.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:55.200
Because again, historically, there's just not a lot of evidence that other movements have been able to really have the kind of results that mass working class parties and unions really had in the 20th century.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:16.200
So for pretty much 50 years, the left has sort of, you know, come out of this pretty, you know, we were pretty disillusioned with the ways in which the union movement and labor parties, social democratic parties became kind of internalized into capitalism and kind of deradicalized in all these ways.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.200
So starting around the 70s, you know, people like Andre Gorges were like, farewell to the working class.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:27.200
We're going to build a new kind of socialist politics that would be more like a movement of movements, right?

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.200
Like many different movements sort of coalescing into one general force that could take on capital.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:40.200
I think we can now say after 50 years that that that movement of movements is just not really borne much fruit, right?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.200
Neither has the labor movement, neither is anything, right?

01:05:43.200 --> 01:06:07.200
So my position is that, you know, if we're still under capitalism, I believe that that there's this more sort of objective, if organized power that the working class has that we should go back to basics, organize parties, organize unions that fight and build collective power through like real institutions.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:18.200
And again, even if these things aren't done in the name of climate change, if you have a more powerful labor movement, it's shown through history, you're going to have more wealth redistribution.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.200
You're going to have higher taxes on the rich.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:29.200
You're going to have much more ambitious programs of public investment on behalf of society, not just for capitalists, right?

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:35.200
And that's the kind of orientation towards public sector investment, redistributive state.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.200
These are the kind of systems we actually need to address climate change.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:46.200
So we got to build a kind of more general movement to get those things before I think we can address climate change at the scale we need to.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:54.200
Wonderful. Matt, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests, and it is if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200
Joyful.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:14.200
I mean, OK, so, you know, I was born in 1978, so I feel like my adult or just my whole life has lived.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:22.200
I've lived through this period of utter defeat for the left and for an utter victory for the capitalist class.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:30.200
So as a historical thinker, I really do firmly believe in my heart that it can't keep being this bad.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:39.200
And that history shows that, you know, you can only, you know, subjugate a population in society for so long before they fight back.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.200
And so I really do think we're we're actually seeing green shoots of that fight back right now.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.200
Actually, you know, Bernie Sanders is one thing.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.200
It was kind of this like electoral magic show, like we're going to win socialism through elections somehow.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:57.200
But it's really about organizing power, really more in workplaces and communities.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.200
And that's what we're starting to see.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.200
You know, in 2022, there's a record number of union organizing drives.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.200
We've seen like a strike wave in the UK recently.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:13.200
I really do think there's kind of what was it in the UK that had that that campaign?

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.200
I think that was called like enough is enough. Right.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:27.200
Yeah. So like I do see like these green shoots of of a fighting working class movements that are sort of coming out of the ashes of neoliberalism.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:41.200
So I that does bring me joy that we might for the next several decades actually have be parts of movements that actually have power to erode the power of capital, which has been all powerful for all these decades.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.200
So that it does get me very excited and joyful.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.200
Great. Matt, thank you so much for being part of future histories.
