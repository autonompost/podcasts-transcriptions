Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groß and it is my great pleasure to welcome Simon Denny in today's episode.

00:07.520 --> 00:13.680
Simon is an artist and professor for time-based media at the HFBK Hamburg.

00:13.680 --> 00:24.880
This episode came together as part of the extended exhibition program of the double exhibition by Simon Denny and Agnieszka Kurant at Kunstverein Hannover.

00:24.880 --> 00:36.880
And I want to say thanks to Christoph Platzgalus, director of the Kunstverein, for making this possible and to Sarah Morais dos Santos-Brus for connecting me to Christoph.

00:36.880 --> 00:41.880
This has been a great pleasure and I really enjoyed talking to Simon, I have to say.

00:41.880 --> 00:50.880
Before we start, I want to welcome Max as a Patreon of Future Histories and now please enjoy today's episode with Simon Denny.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.880
Welcome Simon.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.880
Thank you very much Jan, it's a pleasure to be here.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.880
Pleasure to have you.

01:01.880 --> 01:11.880
Simon, in your work you often investigate different tech imaginaries and the related cultures as well, but let's start with a focus on the imaginary specifically.

01:12.880 --> 01:24.880
What is it that you're investigating when looking at these tech imaginaries, which arguably are not only tech imaginaries, but also always already political imaginaries and economic imaginaries as well?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.880
Well, thanks for the question.

01:26.880 --> 01:32.880
And I think it's one that I think I constantly revisit.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.880
I think I started working on this rather intuitively quite a long time ago.

01:38.880 --> 01:50.880
So I grew up in New Zealand and I moved to Germany where I now live and work around 2007 and I went to an art school in Frankfurt there, the Städelschule, which is connected to the Städel Museum.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.880
And at that time I already had a practice of sorts.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.880
It was my kind of second degree.

01:56.880 --> 02:02.880
I'd already started a gallery and had many peers and interests as an artist.

02:02.880 --> 02:14.880
But one major thing that hit that year was the iPhone and I guess also the scaling of infrastructure like Facebook.

02:14.880 --> 02:26.880
And I just found as somebody who was moving from one community to another, from one locale to another, suddenly the importance of my personal tech stack became very important to me.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.880
It was a communication device, a learning device.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.880
These interfaces just took over my experience.

02:31.880 --> 02:49.880
And at the same time I was around artists who were looking back to the history of how contemporary artists have often, during modernism being, making work which was sort of dealing with the experience or the feeling of technologies as they hit life.

02:49.880 --> 03:06.880
So even early 20th century or late 19th century artists were making work about how technology feels and often in the face of new technological consumer environments and paradigms.

03:06.880 --> 03:23.880
And so I was thinking about people like working in futurism data around the First World War and I was thinking also about mid-century people encountering television and different types of broadcast environments.

03:23.880 --> 03:29.880
So there were a lot of art being made trying to process what these things felt like.

03:29.880 --> 03:45.880
And I guess with the onset of mobile and web to social platforms and user generated content and all of that, I realized that there was another major thing going on and a toolkit to be able to kind of process that culturally.

03:45.880 --> 03:51.880
But I sort of realized that intuitively because I was just involved in all these things.

03:51.880 --> 04:10.880
And I realized also that the conversations that I had among my peers were as much informed by art history and what artists were making as they were by new software and communication strategies that were being shared as a kind of a platform.

04:10.880 --> 04:24.880
So yeah, long story short, I started focusing more and more on who was telling those stories and who was making those platforms because it seemed to be quite important for what they were.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.880
And so I started to go to technology conferences as well as art events.

04:29.880 --> 04:45.880
And I started to speak to and seek out technology founders and listen to their stories and ways of understanding the world culturally and try to kind of process that aesthetically and visually and but also politically.

04:45.880 --> 05:13.880
And yeah, so I guess that's what started me on this path of looking to technological imaginaries or tech imaginaries as ease to understanding contemporary experience and then trying to place that as or process that as art experiences that made sense with the history of how artists have interfaced with these things in the past.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.880
Is that your question?

05:15.880 --> 05:23.880
Yeah, it does. Maybe you could give us an example of one of your works where you specifically try to aim at these imaginaries.

05:23.880 --> 05:36.880
Yeah, so I think the first one that I really remember that I felt really worked was a show that I produced in Munich in 2012-13.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.880
So I went to a technology conference, which is quite well known in this part of the world, the DLD, Digital Life Design.

05:42.880 --> 06:03.880
It's put on by Voodoo Media and it's been going since I think about 2005 or 2006 and has often had kind of major technology founders, particularly from the US and Europe, but only also from Asia and different parts of the world as well, come through on their way to Davos.

06:03.880 --> 06:15.880
It happens a few days before Davos and they come and often people that organize it were able to capture founders at the moments when their products were really scaling.

06:15.880 --> 06:23.880
So Mark Zuckerberg was there at the moment when Facebook was just getting user numbers that were breaking the records and scaling.

06:23.880 --> 06:28.880
And so the year that I sort of first encountered this was 2012-13.

06:28.880 --> 06:46.880
And I was given a bunch of the material that recorded all of the conversations that were happening that year and Jack Dorsey was there, Jimmy Wales was there, Pavel Durov was there, among many other people, Drew Houston.

06:46.880 --> 06:54.880
So founders of Twitter, Dropbox, Wikipedia, Telegram, etc.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.880
Prior to Telegram, it was Vcontact back then.

06:57.880 --> 07:18.880
But yeah, so a number of tech founders basically telling their peers what their vision was for the world and what they saw the world as and what their business and technological toolkit for capturing and exploiting that was going to be.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.880
And I found that event really moving. I found it very affecting.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.880
I was really, I'd never been in an environment like that before.

07:25.880 --> 07:32.880
And I found it overwhelming and challenging and inspiring at the same time.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.880
So I was sort of confused, but I had very strong actions to it.

07:37.880 --> 07:58.880
And then I worked on an artwork that kind of transcribed and took quotes from that process, from those conversations and put them alongside contemporary interface design and printed a bunch of graphic panels that were sort of summaries of each talk.

07:58.880 --> 08:22.880
And then made a kind of a maze in a space called the Munich Kunstverein, where, you know, viewers would walk in a sort of a 3D extension-like environment, like you would if you were stuck in iron, and then be confronted with all of these bombardments of statements and quips about the world and about where technology was going to take us.

08:22.880 --> 08:32.880
So that was kind of the first time I did that, that piece then toured to the U.S. and to New Zealand and to Mini Pinale and other types of things.

08:32.880 --> 08:44.880
And I think that's when I really found my way of, you know, taking really seriously the propositions of business and technology thinkers as keys to understanding culture in our world today.

08:44.880 --> 08:50.880
Let's maybe dig a little bit deeper into this emotional aspect, because this is very interesting to me.

08:50.880 --> 09:05.880
And I'm wondering whether one might maybe connect it to the question of aesthetics in the sense of maybe an aesthetics of imagination, because I mean, of course, aesthetics plays a huge role in all of this.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.880
You know, it's on the level of technological artifacts.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.880
It's on the level of the performance on the stage of these conferences.

09:12.880 --> 09:18.880
It's, for example, meme culture, like being picked up in the blockchain space, stuff like that.

09:18.880 --> 09:28.880
But it's also on the level of imagination as well, I would say, because these imaginations of future, they have to be kind of aesthetically coherent.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.880
They have to be desirable, so to speak.

09:31.880 --> 09:39.880
So there is kind of a realm of treating our imagination of alternative futures as if it was a design space, you know?

09:39.880 --> 09:43.880
So, I mean, they themselves might even not be aware of that.

09:43.880 --> 09:50.880
But there is this question that you have to address, because if you do not address it, people won't kind of pick up on it.

09:50.880 --> 09:59.880
You know, it has to be aesthetic and it has to be desirable or it has to be aesthetic in order to become desirable.

09:59.880 --> 10:09.880
So this is really interesting to me because it also points towards a certain effort that we will have to engage with if we think about alternatives as well.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.880
So I would be interested in your thoughts about this.

10:13.880 --> 10:24.880
Yeah, I mean, in my experience, these types of, you know, the more I looked into exactly this question of, you know, was this a design space?

10:24.880 --> 10:28.880
And if it was, how deliberate a design space is it?

10:28.880 --> 10:35.880
And how are those who are in charge of producing future technological consumer paradigms?

10:35.880 --> 10:47.880
How much do they think about the design space of the imaginaries of their potential clients, which is everybody everywhere all at once, you know?

10:47.880 --> 10:51.880
And I would say in my experience, it's quite explicit.

10:51.880 --> 11:02.880
And quite, you know, I learned more and more just how rich and imaginary these people draw on.

11:02.880 --> 11:07.880
I mean, it's in one way culturally specific and often quite politically specific.

11:07.880 --> 11:15.880
It's often coming from a broadly speaking conservative view frame of the world.

11:15.880 --> 11:26.880
And some are quite conservative, tending towards quite right wing ideas of what politics should be, but not always.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.880
But it's also culturally specific, right?

11:31.880 --> 11:40.880
I guess again, as somebody growing up in New Zealand, I'm very aware of the histories of colonialism and the fact that I come from a history of certainly colonialism.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.880
I'm a white New Zealander.

11:42.880 --> 11:52.880
And, you know, I grew up among a very awkward understanding of the fact that my forefathers had come and essentially expropriated a bunch of land

11:52.880 --> 12:04.880
and, you know, exported an idea of politics and culture and resources and, you know, whatever capitalism onto a space that prior to that was governed by different people in different ways with different values.

12:04.880 --> 12:14.880
And, you know, so I guess I was aware of the fact that when these imaginaries were coming from California and were framed from a bunch of people that looked like me,

12:14.880 --> 12:19.880
that it was again a very culturally specific vision that was being exported and that felt familiar.

12:19.880 --> 12:31.880
And, yeah, also, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but connected to other types of things that I've been looking at culturally in the world anyway.

12:31.880 --> 12:41.880
You know, I think the art world, especially New Zealand when I grew up there, but also in many other places around the world was thinking exactly about these things about which cultural voices had scale

12:41.880 --> 12:48.880
and which were important for imaginaries of culture and political imaginaries and all these other things.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.880
So, yeah, I guess they all kind of connected in my mind.

12:52.880 --> 13:02.880
But, yeah, I mean, even if you just look at Apple, right, you want one of the economical technology companies of the past 50 years.

13:03.880 --> 13:17.880
The, you know, the design thinking thing that is centric to them is obviously understood as a huge part of why they think they themselves are successful, right?

13:17.880 --> 13:40.880
The mythologizing of Johnny Ive and these types of, you know, design focused, aesthetics focused, product design, simplicity, drawing on the history of modernism, all of that is, I think, everybody in that world understands that to be one of the key things of why Apple is so hedonic.

13:40.880 --> 13:49.880
So, yeah, that's one example, but I think there's other examples as well, also from different parts of the, or slightly different parts of the political spectrum.

13:49.880 --> 14:02.880
You know, one of the kind of key arcs of my investigation for the last few years has also been into the political universe around PayPal, Founders Fund, Peter Thiel.

14:02.880 --> 14:08.880
And that's a slightly different, I think, political imaginary than the one that surrounds Apple.

14:08.880 --> 14:17.880
Obviously, there's a lot of similarities as well, but I think there's a different ideological design space there that is aesthetic in a different way, right?

14:17.880 --> 14:27.880
It's not drawing on the same strands of modernism that Apple is, but it is drawing on frontier imaginaries.

14:27.880 --> 14:38.880
It is drawing on, you know, IQ and, you know, race science and things like that really explicitly at different moments in its expression.

14:38.880 --> 14:59.880
So, yeah, I don't know if, again, that's an answer, but I think all of the very powerful people who are at the center of those projects really think a lot about designing inventories in the heads of their clients, users, publics.

14:59.880 --> 15:04.880
So you would say this is very much deliberate on their part, so you would say that somebody...

15:04.880 --> 15:06.880
That's my opinion.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.880
Interesting.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.880
That's my experience.

15:08.880 --> 15:30.880
So you would say that someone like Peter Thiel, for example, you know, not only kind of has an ideological foundation that he builds his kind of worldview upon and then tries to bring this into the world and into actually being through force by capital, so to speak.

15:30.880 --> 15:40.880
But that he kind of reflects upon this aspect of narrative in a, let's say, aesthetic or design frame, so to speak.

15:40.880 --> 15:41.880
That's my understanding.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.880
And I don't think I'm alone in this interpretation of the project.

15:44.880 --> 15:56.880
And I think it becomes more and more visible as you get kind of discourses around, you know, pathways through subculture to producing value as well, which is a more recent turn, I think, in that in that milieu,

15:56.880 --> 16:10.880
whereby there's explicit projects to build publics within traditionally avant-garde cultural spaces to kind of like seed political imaginaries more explicitly.

16:10.880 --> 16:22.880
And again, like, I think I don't want to come across as if I think that, you know, powerful people in California can design the world top down and that they know that that's all possible.

16:22.880 --> 16:30.880
I think it's very haphazard at the same time, but I don't think that contradicts the fact that it's I think that's the part of the project.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.880
I think that's an explicit part of the design space of the project, right?

16:33.880 --> 16:38.880
I think there's many attempts by many companies to do many things in terms of create a culture.

16:38.880 --> 16:45.880
I mean, you hear projects a lot talk about community, producing community and community being one of the key things to seed a product, right?

16:45.880 --> 16:49.880
If you don't have community, then you don't have a way to scale.

16:49.880 --> 17:01.880
And I think that is a, you know, that's a common project across many kind of Silicon Valley-ish things working in that tradition, right?

17:01.880 --> 17:09.880
I think most people who are in the space of designing those projects know that they don't always work and there's an amount of luck and haphazardness and synergy.

17:09.880 --> 17:23.880
You know, so I don't I don't claim to have the idea that there are kind of people who even very powerful people who are able to sit at the center of thing and completely design it and sort of just press the go button on a Goldberg machine.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.880
And suddenly there's a political paradigm or whatever.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.880
I don't think they think that and I don't think that's possible.

17:28.880 --> 17:37.880
But I do think that explicitly designing imaginaries is a part of producing publics that produce products that are sustained by political paradigms.

17:37.880 --> 17:46.880
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, and of course, I mean, there are also historical examples where this has been done quite successfully.

17:46.880 --> 18:04.880
There's the Montpeleris Society where the neoliberals very early on kind of had a roadmap how to implement these types of ideas into the public sphere and kind of were quite successful in executing their plans as well.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.880
So, of course, it's not and these people.

18:07.880 --> 18:12.880
Yeah, no, exactly. But and these people are explicit students of those projects.

18:12.880 --> 18:20.880
You know, like one of I mean, I've been lucky enough to see, you know, some of these really key actors play into this world a little bit.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.880
I was I was a guest at the Montpeleris Society meet up at the Hoover Institution.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.880
No shit.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.880
2020 and the keynote speaker was Peter Thiel.

18:30.880 --> 18:47.880
And, you know, there's a there's a there's a key there's a there's a real literacy, I think, in certain parts of the communities that make these incredible products and incredible politics and publics that knows what they're drawing on, you know.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.880
And at that meeting was incredible.

18:49.880 --> 19:01.880
There was also a kind of a show of the Hoover Institution Archive of Milton Friedman's work, which is, again, I think, another really important milestone in this cultural arc.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.880
And and also Frigida Kayak's founding of the Montpeleris Society.

19:05.880 --> 19:16.880
There was an incredible relic there and I'm very attracted to material relics in my work sculpture and a painter and I work a lot with making exhibitions and making objects as well as making digital things.

19:16.880 --> 19:24.880
And there was a really compelling object at that meet up that I'll never forget that I think kind of contains some of the, you know, what we're talking about.

19:24.880 --> 19:37.880
There was a kind of a giant tablecloth with the signatories of all of the founders of the Montpeleris Society sewn into it, which is a part of the Hoover Institution's Archive of Hayek's.

19:37.880 --> 19:51.880
So, you know, I think, you know, this is this is the world that I find fascinating because these objects I think are just their values, but I think they're slightly undervalued in terms of their role and importance in our kind of cultural world.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.880
Very interesting.

19:52.880 --> 20:01.880
Very interesting. And what would you say? Because, I mean, there had been a certain roadmap back then when Montpeleris Society was founded.

20:01.880 --> 20:06.880
What would you say? What are the shifts that took place?

20:06.880 --> 20:17.880
Not really since then, but what are the essential shifts that the generation that is active right now, so to speak, maybe see different and enact differently?

20:17.880 --> 20:26.880
I mean, not the least because there are, of course, also different kind of affordances through the technological stack that is now available.

20:26.880 --> 20:34.880
And they obviously do use it quite actively, the potential and try to kind of bring it to their use.

20:34.880 --> 20:48.880
So how did they shift this perspective? Maybe do they have different types of approaches when they try to imagine the enactment of these imaginaries?

20:48.880 --> 20:52.880
I mean, that question, I'm probably not qualified to answer.

20:52.880 --> 21:01.880
I mean, I can speculate what I think might be the case, but I don't have concrete answers of the explicit differences.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.880
You know, I'm neither an economic historian nor, you know, I'm an artist.

21:04.880 --> 21:18.880
Right. So I sort of do embedded projects to try and understand communities and kind of pull out aesthetic moments that capture and reify some of what I think is an important vibe.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.880
Right. That's my level of qualification and my kind of what I can actually claim that I do.

21:22.880 --> 21:32.880
Right. All of this other stuff around it, this rhetorical material and my speculations on various different business strategies is kind of amateur work.

21:32.880 --> 21:44.880
Right. But yeah, I mean, I think to my mind, there would be a very sophisticated understanding of what's possible in terms of where we are with the technology stack at the moment.

21:44.880 --> 21:59.880
I think anybody involved in a VC community as influential as Founders Fund or Teal Capital or even Andreessen Horowitz, you know, is an incredible attractor of information of what's possible technologically and what might be possible coming technologically.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.880
So I think that that's definitely an important arm of their political apparatus.

22:03.880 --> 22:10.880
Let's say if you were building a political project as we think these people might be doing, certainly you would be considering that.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.880
And there's definitely very, very good information coming to you first all the time.

22:14.880 --> 22:19.880
Right. Because you offer money to found and support these projects as they grow.

22:19.880 --> 22:45.880
Right. So that's it. I think that that combination between financial leverage and power translated into an information stream of kind of like a continual updating and evolving of understanding what is possible in terms of communication networks, financial infrastructures, and then possible ramifications of what those are becoming might be.

22:45.880 --> 22:52.880
And I think all of that is an incredible tool that people like Hayek and even Friedman probably wouldn't have had access to. Right.

22:52.880 --> 23:12.880
So I think there's I think that's also a real difference maybe between, again, from my amateur understanding of the kind of technology founder of yesteryear and the adjacency to politics and the kind of political environment that they might have been operating in the mid

23:12.880 --> 23:31.880
20th century, even an Intel or a, you know, and a kind of a more contemporary figure also like Elon Musk or something like that, who one gets the sense to Elon Musk and these types of actors are maybe sometimes even political and rhetorical first, you know,

23:31.880 --> 23:50.880
that's at least my interpretation of it. Right. So I think you could you could argue that a figure like Elon Musk understands as good as anybody else, but possibly better than most people, why Twitter is valuable, and Twitter is a valuable tool rhetorically and politically as much as it is financially, you know,

23:50.880 --> 24:05.880
And I think he is an actor that seemingly continually iterates and experiments on how that tool can be deployed to his advantage, both as a businessman, but also as a growing attractor of political power.

24:05.880 --> 24:20.880
So, you know, so I don't know if that's on topic or off topic argument, but I think I think the Yeah, the tools and availabilities now compared to, you know, when even in the mid century, so even 50 years after even in the data era, right.

24:20.880 --> 24:41.880
When when it's arguable that Mont Pelerin's, you know, labors finally sort of came into mainstream political usage between Thatcher and Reagan, and sometimes explicitly, I'm sure you'll know that Thatcher, you know, really embraced Hayek, you know, also nominal.

24:41.880 --> 24:52.880
But, yeah, I think I think that there's a big difference in terms of, of what's possible now, you know, and, yeah.

24:52.880 --> 25:20.880
And I mean, there are big differences in terms of what is possible now, not only for them, but hopefully also for us, I would say. So I would be also interested in what could desirable alternatives on this level of abstraction on the level of, let's say, socio-technical imaginaries, and what could they look like, and what would you say how, again, how conscious of an effort it can actually be to develop these imaginaries?

25:21.880 --> 25:41.880
Well, yeah, I mean, again, just to situate my answer, again, I'm an artist, not a, not a political thinker. I mean, you know, I think about politics, but I'm not a, I don't design policy. I'm not in dialogue with people that, you know, spend all their time and, you know, become very well informed about what may or may not work.

25:42.880 --> 26:10.880
You know, so, so just to qualify my answer, but I'm sure it's possible to imagine using these types of environments and apparatuses to different political ends. It must be logically possible, right? I think the difficulty with that seems to be, to me, that a part of all of that is, is also centralized power and leverage.

26:10.880 --> 26:25.880
That it's hard to replicate, right? And this is, this has, I guess, synergies and rhymes with conversations around AI, you know, again, as I pay attention to various different conversations that surround various different technologies.

26:25.880 --> 26:49.880
We are now in a, in a hype cycle that focuses on the promise of AI, but one of the qualifiers that always comes with that, and I think you see that in terms of spending and resource allocation and personnel decisions, everything that's affecting the technology community right now, that, you know, very few, very big actors are really at the center of being able to deploy these tools.

26:50.880 --> 27:05.880
And I think that's somewhat true with the world of political imaginaries and arms of technology that I was describing as well, you know, so while I hope that there's ways that people who have different politics could get access to those design spaces.

27:05.880 --> 27:26.880
I think it's a formidable task to overcome centralized power like that, as it's, as it's become centralized, you know, where I got excited again, as a, as a kind of cultural lightning rod and and rare fire along the way all of these stories was was around crypto.

27:26.880 --> 27:36.880
And I spent quite a lot of time as crypto emerged, thinking and being excited about the fact that alternative financial power structures were being explicitly designed.

27:36.880 --> 27:42.880
And with them, there were various rhetorical and ideological spaces also emerging.

27:42.880 --> 27:58.880
I enjoyed seeing a full political spectrum of those emerging around blockchains. So I saw right libertarianism, of course, heap various different visions on top of those infrastructures and thrive.

27:58.880 --> 28:23.880
But I also saw really interesting people come out of activism from the left emerge from protest movements from the, you know, mid 2000s, like, like Occupy people coming from those types of histories also attracted to designing through blockchains through the idea that designable money spaces might, you know, open up different political opportunities.

28:24.880 --> 28:31.880
We're at a moment in the hype cycle in the blockchain story and the political imagination surrounding the blockchain story, which is quite low.

28:31.880 --> 28:47.880
There's a lot of pessimism. And I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that there's been many scammers and actors exposed new new technological spaces always have potential upsides for incredible amounts of arbitrage.

28:47.880 --> 28:54.880
And this is often where people accrue power at the beginnings of those new technological paradigm deployments.

28:54.880 --> 29:08.880
And yeah, and with that becomes a kind of gray, gray area legally that people often try and capture the surplus from think Airbnb and Uber and very kind of banal versions, right?

29:08.880 --> 29:14.880
Things that were sort of not quite legal suddenly became an opportunity to capture a whole huge market sector.

29:14.880 --> 29:27.880
And therefore a power base. And I think in blockchains, there was a huge amount of possibilities for that and a really long period of time when it was a gray market and it still kind of is even what's firming up right now.

29:28.880 --> 29:47.880
You know, certainly this is this allowed for the growth of DeFi and all these other kind of projects and yeah, and huge opportunities for scammers, which are now kind of meeting regulation as as the world of financial regulation catches up with catches up with those projects.

29:48.880 --> 29:59.880
A lot of yeah, a lot of disappointing stories come out of the blockchain space and therefore make it less of an attractive space for political narratives as well at the moment.

29:59.880 --> 30:06.880
But let's see, maybe maybe things could could change along that environment as well.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.880
I want to dig a little bit deeper into this question of the recent history.

30:10.880 --> 30:16.880
But before that, just because you like now a second time try to situate rightly.

30:16.880 --> 30:22.880
So try to situate your answer and and pointed out that you are quote unquote, just an artist.

30:22.880 --> 30:28.880
For me, that's that's one of the reasons why I ask you these specific questions around aesthetics of imagination and stuff like that.

30:28.880 --> 30:44.880
And of course, because you very much engage with these imaginaries in your work in general, before we move on to digging a little deeper into this recent history, I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into this question of alternative imaginary still, because I mean,

30:44.880 --> 30:53.880
One question would also be that coming from your like deep engagement with the existing socio-technical imaginaries.

30:53.880 --> 31:12.880
Do you think there are certain maybe leverage points or certain fields that can and should be addressed by any alternative socio-technical imaginary in order to maybe also become as desirable,

31:12.880 --> 31:24.880
you know, to kind of put it back to this question of that it needs to be desirable, you know, because I more and more come to the conclusion that this is like really, really, really crucial.

31:24.880 --> 31:31.880
You know, because within future histories, for example, I very much engage with this question of democratic planning and how this could be brought about.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.880
I engage with these different models and so on.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.880
And of course, this is all important.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.880
And the theory behind these models is important, too.

31:38.880 --> 31:44.880
But I oftentimes get to this point where I think, oh, wait a second.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.880
I mean, of course, it's important to have a theoretical discussion about this.

31:48.880 --> 32:03.880
But this construction of alternative imaginaries in relation to desires is even as important as this theoretical discussion about, you know, comprehensive models of democratic planning.

32:03.880 --> 32:08.880
So do you think that there are certain, how do you say, Hebel?

32:08.880 --> 32:10.880
You speak German? Do you speak German?

32:10.880 --> 32:11.880
Certain leverage points.

32:11.880 --> 32:17.880
Yeah, certain leverage points to go about this task, you know?

32:17.880 --> 32:20.880
Yeah, I mean, I think there are.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.880
And I think that's a fair question.

32:22.880 --> 32:42.880
And I think that actually oftentimes, you know, these very intelligent thinkers that we've been referring to before that have been in charge of very successful products see these spaces and develop them really effectively.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.880
Right.

32:43.880 --> 32:55.880
And so I think message boards in the 90s and the 2000s were kind of cedars of potential possibilities for politics and culture.

32:55.880 --> 33:12.880
And I think that in those imaginaries were born possibilities that played out culturally, right, that started with culture first and then kind of, or started with a particular, I don't want to be determinist in where things begin.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.880
Maybe that's the wrong way to put it.

33:13.880 --> 33:21.880
But I think that certainly, you know, certain moments have been recognized to kind of coalesce certain politics, right?

33:21.880 --> 33:35.880
So let's say to put a concrete name on it, let's say that there was a kind of a conservative meme factory produced within 4chan, right?

33:35.880 --> 33:37.880
Let's make it simple like that.

33:37.880 --> 33:42.880
And that was a combination of a cultural force and a technological paradigm.

33:42.880 --> 33:57.880
And various people on the left also recognize that that was happening, particularly in the Trump run up to the Trump era and how important that felt culturally during that era of his first run to presidency.

33:57.880 --> 34:06.880
I remember a lot of conversations and analysis going into why 4chan was able to produce, you know, Trump supporting memes and political narratives.

34:06.880 --> 34:28.880
And I think that those same communities seem to be popping up in avant-garde art adjacent and cultural adjacent circles now and funding small offline communities and pumping quite a lot of resources and space into those situations and glamour.

34:28.880 --> 34:56.880
And I think that part of the apparatus of what art can produce is sort of some kind of synthesis of money, glamour and seeding ideas through events and small communities that then kind of scale into larger conversations and often take place in geographical centers of money in certain parts of our empire, let's say.

34:56.880 --> 35:07.880
And I don't see as much of that same recognition of that power being as organized in circles around the left.

35:07.880 --> 35:20.880
So I think there would be an opportunity there for getting money and resources together and kind of seeding political spaces that are adjacent to art and glamour in the way that those spaces are.

35:20.880 --> 35:26.880
And I think a lot of the actors that, you know, I'm also a teacher in art school, so I see the beginnings of some of these conversations.

35:26.880 --> 35:34.880
It's very normal for art school students to band together and produce very authentic, interesting, exciting, glamorous young spaces.

35:34.880 --> 35:40.880
But those spaces often, especially today, are running away from running out of money sources.

35:40.880 --> 35:49.880
And I think from the kind of political sector and the political left, there used to be a lot more, especially in Europe, available to support these structures.

35:49.880 --> 35:53.880
I think in Germany, it's still done a pretty good job of doing that.

35:53.880 --> 36:01.880
But I know in other parts of the Anglosphere, it's definitely not as easy to do these things as it used to be.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.880
And those things used to seed, I think, important political things.

36:05.880 --> 36:12.880
And it was a space for starting ideas and creating the kind of momentum necessary to scale ideas very organically.

36:13.880 --> 36:20.880
I'm sure you know the term, again, from the kind of chat room world of the idea of force memeing, right?

36:20.880 --> 36:24.880
The idea that a meme can't be designed top down.

36:24.880 --> 36:39.880
It has to be a bottom up experience and something about architecture and the personnel that went into producing memes in 4chan that really scaled was a special piece of magic that was very, very hard to reproduce in other types of environments.

36:39.880 --> 36:46.880
Even if somebody put the kind of seemingly the same ingredients together, it didn't often produce the same stickiness and scale.

36:46.880 --> 36:51.880
And I think that that's also true with kind of culture.

36:51.880 --> 36:55.880
You can't sort of top down force meme avant-garde art either.

36:55.880 --> 37:00.880
It sort of has to be a bottom up experience that then gets kind of picked up at the right time with the right amplifiers.

37:00.880 --> 37:23.880
And there's a very special, I think, set of expertise that art schools and the adjacent spaces and kind of arts council funding type arrangements are able to produce and have produced very effectively in the last 50 to 100 years in Britain, America, and New Zealand, these cultures that I'm really familiar with, and also in Germany.

37:23.880 --> 37:38.880
So I think that could be an opportunity that is now being exploited by people on the more conservative end of things very explicitly that could be reinvested in by people of other politics.

37:38.880 --> 37:49.880
Okay, and then maybe let's bring these two elements together and take another look at this question of recent history when it comes to this relation of the left and tech.

37:49.880 --> 38:05.880
Because, I mean, one way to put it might be, or at least of the recent history, you might say that, okay, there was this like 2014, 15 moment where you had this accelerationist manifesto by Srenichek and Williams.

38:05.880 --> 38:18.880
You had their book, then afterwards, Inventing the Future, you had the xenofeminist manifesto, Falk, so fully automated luxury communism floated around at this time also.

38:18.880 --> 38:27.880
So all of these things kind of popped up trying to maybe renegotiate this question of technology and the left.

38:27.880 --> 38:39.880
So there was this, and then I guess some of the kind of cryptosphere, the blockchain space, I would say, maybe leached upon this energy.

38:39.880 --> 38:51.880
Some of the energy that came out of this, I would say, also kind of went into the blockchain sphere in this, as you already pointed towards an enthusiasm around, for example, DAOs and stuff like that.

38:51.880 --> 39:01.880
And I, for one, remain a little skeptical whether or not this did the whole thing really a favor or not.

39:01.880 --> 39:16.880
But apart from this question, whether or not the cryptosphere was leaching parts of this energy, I would say that there's also arguably another aspect to this accelerationist moment

39:16.880 --> 39:23.880
that kind of takes apart in why it has to be rethought, I would say.

39:23.880 --> 39:37.880
And this is the more or less, not completely, but more or less unreflected or, let's say, not sufficiently reflected inherent problems with Promethean progressivism, so to speak.

39:37.880 --> 39:47.880
So I would say, of course, the accelerationists had some valid points when it comes to what they called folk politics, so to speak.

39:47.880 --> 39:57.880
Then on the other side, again, I think, for example, the question of ecology or the ecological question kind of is a crystallization point,

39:57.880 --> 40:11.880
also for why this kind of Promethean progressivism in its kind of unreflected form also cannot lead to sufficient answers, so to speak.

40:11.880 --> 40:17.880
So this might be a way to frame the very recent history, so to speak.

40:17.880 --> 40:28.880
And I would be interested whether either you agree with this framing and then what do you think, what's the point where we are at right now?

40:28.880 --> 40:37.880
I think you already kind of pointed towards this aspect that AI, because of the way that the infrastructure is built,

40:37.880 --> 40:44.880
kind of has a tendency or a strong tendency towards centralization, and that's an aspect of it.

40:44.880 --> 40:55.880
But maybe you could elaborate a bit more on what you think is the point where we are at right now when it comes to this question of the left and tech.

40:55.880 --> 41:01.880
Yeah, again, I'll make a stab at it from my armchair.

41:01.880 --> 41:07.880
I'm going to say this 10 times on this podcast, but my primary project is producing fantastic artworks.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.880
That's what I spend most of my time trying to do.

41:10.880 --> 41:15.880
And I feel that a part of that project is informing myself as best as I can about politics and aesthetics and all these things.

41:15.880 --> 41:21.880
So I have kind of opinions, but this is not what I put my primary energy into understanding.

41:21.880 --> 41:26.880
I try to put all that energy into what makes a great artwork and a great art experience.

41:26.880 --> 41:42.880
But having said that disclaimer, I've been really interested in this flow of energy, maybe from accelerationist adjacent things coming from a history of CCRU and those types of thinkers.

41:43.880 --> 41:48.880
Again, I think it's really interesting how left-right polarities emerge in this context.

41:48.880 --> 41:55.880
So if you take that history, again, and standing of it, you have Sadie Plant on the one side and Nick Land on the other.

41:55.880 --> 42:04.880
And that's the sort of framework for the political possibilities within accelerationism and its forebearer.

42:04.880 --> 42:09.880
And yeah, I guess with Mark Fisher in the middle.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.880
So I think that was the background that I understood accelerationism to be emerging out of.

42:15.880 --> 42:22.880
And certainly a group of artists around that as well were kind of interested in Jason and kind of trying to work through the cultural possibilities of that.

42:22.880 --> 42:31.880
And that was, I think, broadly what was termed at the time post-internet art actors, which is when I became active and visible also within my own art making.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.880
Then crypto, I think, did emerge out of similar communities.

42:34.880 --> 42:43.880
And some of the energies and hopes that I saw organizing in the art world around the banner of post-internet and accelerationist thought and questioning it.

42:43.880 --> 42:57.880
Often also within art, you have this really productive, I think, space where a lot of things are examined and tried out, even things that one is politically both aligned with and questioning.

42:58.880 --> 43:05.880
So you got a sort of a full exploration of the possibilities of those spaces from left to right within art.

43:05.880 --> 43:12.880
And I think that was also true and still potentially true within crypto, which is maybe we're at the end of a certain arc.

43:12.880 --> 43:26.880
But let's say as the accelerationist question lost its momentum culturally, I think that crypto was becoming more attractive to similar types of people with similar types of questions.

43:26.880 --> 43:38.880
Who wanted to look both at the design space of politics and the design space, aesthetics, and then this kind of new foregrounding of the financial design space at the same time.

43:38.880 --> 43:41.880
So I think a lot of productive thinking got done around that.

43:41.880 --> 43:48.880
And actually there was and still is, I think, a kind of ecological question at the center of that too.

43:49.880 --> 43:56.880
Resource questions were always at the center of conversation, certainly from the art perspective around crypto.

43:56.880 --> 44:05.880
There was huge debates around whether one could use proof of work or not because it was so energy intensive.

44:05.880 --> 44:10.880
And certainly I did a bunch of work that addressed that very directly as well.

44:10.880 --> 44:20.880
I found that really compelling. But I had peers alongside me as well that were designing projects that were sort of trying to think about how nature and nature is the wrong word.

44:20.880 --> 44:36.880
Let's say non-human actors could interact with markets as a potential space for also designing systems that took into account things that in the, let's say, more mainstream economic world were considered to be externalities.

44:36.880 --> 44:46.880
So what if financial things were in dialogue with natural things and those designs could be more synergistic, capturing more of a whole.

44:46.880 --> 44:58.880
So I'm thinking about things that happened around project spaces like Trust in Berlin and projects like Terra Zero that were sort of circling around that group of people.

44:58.880 --> 45:13.880
They were coming in and out of conversations happening with spaces like Strelka, also kind of design thinking worlds that also interacted with various other art actors at the same time.

45:13.880 --> 45:23.880
So I think that was a really productive little moment. And then NFTs as a phenomenon came and blew all that energy apart and sort of confused everybody.

45:24.880 --> 45:39.880
Because suddenly there was this, you know, those were all quite modest and small experiments that were happening with crypto and DOWs and stuff prior to 2021 when NFT explosion kind of like took over everybody's attention space.

45:39.880 --> 45:52.880
And suddenly there was this sort of casino aspect in there that had been backgrounded that sort of hadn't really been the most important thing for those people who were interested in that design space up until that moment.

45:52.880 --> 45:57.880
But then suddenly certain people saw access to capital that they'd never imagined.

45:57.880 --> 46:06.880
And I think started to design, you know, products in different ways that sort of addressed value capture financially, much more explicitly.

46:06.880 --> 46:16.880
And again, I wouldn't personally describe that as a corruption, but it certainly shifted the focus to value capture and business design.

46:16.880 --> 46:29.880
And, you know, again, things that I think are really important actually to solving anything because you can't go on organizing with goodwill alone and the kind of hours that youth allows dries up as one gets older.

46:29.880 --> 46:36.880
And, you know, you need more resources to produce thinking and remain sustainable.

46:36.880 --> 46:53.880
So, again, I don't think that was a part of the puzzle, but I do think it took some of the narrative emphasis out of some of the more adventurous designing between money, resources and non-human actors and all these kind of urgent questions.

46:53.880 --> 47:09.880
And then AI, I think, again, we were at another moment where the recent hype cycle in AI, certainly in the art world, is spurred by access to text to image prompt, consumer facing goods.

47:09.880 --> 47:18.880
You know, the AI systems that produce them have been there for a long time, and there's been really productive questions also being asked by various artists around what's possible with AI and what isn't.

47:18.880 --> 47:23.880
Also from the political left explicitly.

47:23.880 --> 47:33.880
But then suddenly you have all these kind of image prompt things which again sort of produce a Cambrian explosion of potential possibilities that has a kind of hype and energy cycle into it.

47:33.880 --> 47:44.880
But, you know, I was in touch with some of the people that were founding the Mid Journey project, and there were artists very close to the beginning of that project.

47:44.880 --> 47:51.880
So David, the founder, had a group of people who were very art adjacent around him as he was doing the first iterations of that engine.

47:51.880 --> 48:07.880
And, you know, I designed an NFT project with one of the founders of CryptoKitties called DotCom Seance, which used very early algorithms that weren't Mid Journey but were kind of adjacent to that before Mid Journey existed with the same community of people.

48:07.880 --> 48:15.880
And I know other artists like John Raffman also were there trying out things at the same time, so this is again the same kind of community of people that I've been talking about for the longer time.

48:15.880 --> 48:31.880
But then when that becomes a kind of hit product, I think, you know, immediately voices like ours became less interesting to David than other people around him designing business models which were more, you know, about value capture and scale.

48:31.880 --> 48:41.880
So I think at the moment, there are AI and ownership adjacent conversations which I think are really interesting that are happening from this community.

48:41.880 --> 48:59.880
I'm thinking explicitly of Matt Dryhurst and Holly Herndon's project Spawning that they're building, which is about ownership and training sets and trying to define more explicit spaces for artists ownership and royalties associated with being a part of various training sets.

48:59.880 --> 49:00.880
I think that's really interesting.

49:00.880 --> 49:11.880
I mean, again, I don't know if I would put that on a left right spectrum, but I think it's about the small actor having agency and centralized systems.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.880
So I think that could be could be could be left Jason.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.880
And so that's where I think that's happening.

49:18.880 --> 49:28.880
But I think also AI is a harder thing to become a part of than crypto was for a small actor because because of the centralized nature of the of the technology.

49:28.880 --> 49:37.880
So you can build on top of centralized systems, but it's not the same thing as starting your own protocol or becoming part of a core group of Ethereum devs.

49:37.880 --> 49:53.880
You know, these things were just more open culturally and and and and actively, you know, and I was very lucky to be around a Berlin and around a cultural balloon that was adjacent to the flowering of Ethereum's possibilities at the times.

49:53.880 --> 49:56.880
And it was whatever you think of the Ethereum project now.

49:56.880 --> 50:07.880
And and and there is a real spectrum of political possibilities, I think, in the Ethereum community, some which are very right libertarian and some which are much more left adjacent.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.880
But at least those spaces are open.

50:09.880 --> 50:10.880
You can walk into those rooms.

50:10.880 --> 50:16.880
You can, you know, if you're if you're if you're in those circles, they're approachable and and somewhat understandable.

50:16.880 --> 50:21.880
And I think, yeah, for me, the adjacency to AI is so much more distant.

50:23.880 --> 50:40.880
I mean, what always struck me with the crypto sphere and the imaginaries that are that were coming out of that and even the imaginaries that were developed in a more like left leaning spectrum, which I guess is one that you're also engaging with.

50:40.880 --> 50:56.880
I mean, there's a certain type of pre-configuration going on, which is that the way in which these imaginaries are built is always on top of a layer that is kind of strictly transactional.

50:57.880 --> 51:02.880
You know, so the because that's kind of built in to these infrastructures.

51:02.880 --> 51:15.880
It's it's at the end, the tools that they try to employ for building, I don't know, a left utopian dowel or whatever, you know, the tools are framed within a framework that is strictly transactional.

51:15.880 --> 51:35.880
And that at the end kind of has a certain tool set, which is in most of the time can be and I'm being polemic here, but can be kind of boiled down to monetary incentive structures that that they try to employ in order to get people to do whatever.

51:35.880 --> 51:44.880
And that's a certain type of way of relating to things, to people, to more than human nature, to whatever, you know.

51:44.880 --> 51:54.880
And if you limit yourself in such a fashion, then this is already a very, very, very narrow corridor within which you think about these alternatives.

51:54.880 --> 52:03.880
And this is this was really very irritating to me, I have to say, when when interacting with these types of projects.

52:03.880 --> 52:16.880
And and but then within this narrow corridor, of course, the people are very enthusiastic, very also kind of honestly trying to do things differently.

52:16.880 --> 52:21.880
But I'm looking at it and I'm thinking, yeah, it's already flawed.

52:21.880 --> 52:27.880
I could imagine a lot of the actors that I was in contact with during this period could relate very well to that analysis.

52:27.880 --> 52:36.880
So I think that it's a it's a it's a wall that a number of people I know found themselves up against and found to be limiting.

52:36.880 --> 52:49.880
Yeah, but then but then if we stick to this small description of recent history and we had, you know, this explorationist energy kind of going into parts of the crypto sphere.

52:49.880 --> 53:00.880
And now we get to this point where we have this critique where with this obviously is a corridor that is framed way too narrowly.

53:00.880 --> 53:03.880
Then what's where do we go from here?

53:03.880 --> 53:10.880
You know, and then and you also pointed out that the AI thing is kind of too difficult to get into.

53:10.880 --> 53:14.880
But it doesn't mean that it's not only right now.

53:14.880 --> 53:20.880
Yeah, yeah, no. But but the question would be where you know that there must be other roads to go as well.

53:20.880 --> 53:29.880
You know, that's not it's not just AI or, you know, the dead end of incentivation through through crypto tokens or whatever.

53:29.880 --> 53:39.880
You know, there are other ways as well. Do you have any feeling or any are there any sparks that you can see that point towards different directions?

53:40.880 --> 54:01.880
I mean, my, you know, my flannery, or if that's a that's a word, you know, position that that I have right has always been trying to come to things where I see emerging possibilities happening and sort of figuring out what's going on culturally and

54:01.880 --> 54:06.880
trying to reify that into something that makes sense and within my idiom.

54:06.880 --> 54:12.880
And and I've seen a few hype cycles come and go.

54:12.880 --> 54:18.880
Right. And I think we certainly are at a low point in the crypto hype cycle where very few possibilities are seen.

54:18.880 --> 54:28.880
Some some very few possibilities are seen because of what you said that the design space is so specifically interest that there is no alternative possible to build on those foundations.

54:28.880 --> 54:35.880
That would be one bottoming out of a hype cycle. Hope world for certain actors.

54:35.880 --> 54:43.880
Right. And I think that often when you reach a trough like that, it's quiet for a few months.

54:43.880 --> 54:52.880
And then there's another moment where suddenly somebody sees something in that design space that can alter that that can be something different.

54:52.880 --> 55:02.880
And I'm never the person that or my role is not to spawn these moments or to to start them.

55:02.880 --> 55:07.880
But it's more to be listening close enough to to notice them as they emerge.

55:07.880 --> 55:13.880
Right now, I'm not sure where that's going to come from. But but we're not at the end of history yet.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.880
And and I'm sure there will be moments of possibility.

55:16.880 --> 55:21.880
And I think often in the past, these spaces have opened up in very surprising ways.

55:21.880 --> 55:28.880
You know, so again, like, I don't think anybody making art on blockchains saw NFTs coming as a paradigm shift.

55:28.880 --> 55:34.880
Nobody, you know, and there were many people frustratedly trying to find a way to connect.

55:34.880 --> 55:38.880
I mean, this is a very narrow design space. Again, it's not the same political macro you're talking about.

55:38.880 --> 55:46.880
But in terms of like hype cycles and possibility horizons in imaginaries, I think often it can seem like there's nothing.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.880
And then all of a sudden, there's something that changes that perspective.

55:49.880 --> 55:54.880
And it's very, very hard to see coming down the road until you're sort of on it.

55:54.880 --> 55:58.880
And I'm not on it right now. And I don't know where it's coming down the road.

55:58.880 --> 56:05.880
But I imagine there will be a turn which makes a design space and an imaginary space possible, you know, if that gives you an answer.

56:05.880 --> 56:12.880
Yeah, yeah. And I just wanted to point out that at least to me, it doesn't seem surprising that NFT came along, I have to say.

56:12.880 --> 56:18.880
I mean, not that I could have foreseen it, but it's very coherent, I would say, because I mean, it...

56:18.880 --> 56:23.880
Yeah, but everything's coherent in retrospect, right? That's the thing about history.

56:23.880 --> 56:27.880
Yeah, well, I mean, that's true. But I mean, it's coherent in the way that...

56:28.880 --> 56:38.880
I mean, what blockchains always did was to formalize ownership without formalizing identity.

56:38.880 --> 56:50.880
And so there was always a form of kind of focusing on there was a strong emphasis on ownership.

56:50.880 --> 57:13.880
And so the idea that this space at some point will bring about kind of the quote unquote ultimate idea of hyper speculative ownership asset is kind of that's why I mean, it's coherent.

57:13.880 --> 57:16.880
Makes sense. No, I understand what you're saying.

57:16.880 --> 57:31.880
But I mean, I think I also the other part of the answer maybe to your question of like, you know, is there going to be a design space that's possible that's anything to do with crypto or AI that the people who want to build things on the left can engage with in earnest without being defeated before the purpose?

57:31.880 --> 57:35.880
I mean, I wonder if that question is so specific to technology, right?

57:36.880 --> 57:38.880
Yeah, no, no, no, it's not. Of course. Yeah.

57:38.880 --> 57:49.880
Right. But this is what maybe is maybe important from my macro cultural perspective to understand it's maybe not a technical question.

57:49.880 --> 58:15.880
That's maybe a question that is broader, because I also don't see anything outside of crypto as a design space, which also doesn't rely on the underpinnings of, of, you know, basically monetarist understanding of, of how power works and how people align and what you know what getting communities

58:15.880 --> 58:31.880
together means and what the levers are to, to nudge those is, you know, so it's, yeah, as I say, I think it's not really a technological question, but it's a cultural question that the technology projects that are built and, and built on reflect as well, right?

58:31.880 --> 58:51.880
If the technology is a, is a, is a relic of a political environment, again, without being determinist of which comes first, it's unsurprising that the technological stack is in synergy with a general narrative around what possibilities are for design in general, right?

58:51.880 --> 59:09.880
Yeah, right, right. And I just want to state clearly that I, of course, also do not think that it's a technological project first, of course, it's a, it's a political project, but I'm specifically interested in this nexus, you know, and I think you are too, somehow, you know, and then, so this is then

59:10.880 --> 59:38.880
Maybe we can revisit earlier moments in our conversation, right? We're like, you know, we see where are actors looking for spaces of possibility that have a lot of information available to them, right? And, and again, on the conservative side of things, politically, I see actors investing a lot in, in offline small communities of cultural actors, doing, you know, seeding ideas in a very organic bottom

59:38.880 --> 59:59.880
up way. And that is, of course, a social technology, one could frame it like that. So maybe that's a space of possibility for people of different politics as well to invest in, you know, ground level, authentic, small communities of people who have energy and a little bit of glamour around

59:59.880 --> 01:00:24.880
them. Maybe those are technological spaces for invention. You don't have to use the word crypto to describe those, you don't have to use mention AI to describe those spaces. Those are very human cultural technologies. And I think, yeah, if that's a possibility space that is worthy enough for very busy people with a lot of resources to invest their time and energies in

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:54.880
cultivating explicitly, then perhaps we can do that in cheaper ways ourselves that don't need that capital, especially if we are the actors indeed producing that value, supposedly, right? So that's where I see the possibility for people that I teach in art that I, you know, I have a mentoring program that I also co founded with a bunch of artists outside of my academic teaching and in the German art school system, called Berlin Program for Artists, which helps artists who are already starting out their journeys into being kind of professional actors.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:11.880
Outside of institutions like schools, and gives them a community to work with. I think that's a very worthwhile, you know, deployment of my personal efforts and capital, the limited amount that I have, you know. So I think, yeah, maybe that's an answer in terms of where possibility is.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:35.880
I mean, I have one question here where you quite surely will have to have a disclaimer again. I'm not sure if I should, but I'll just ask it and we'll see where it takes us. I mean, because there's a certain dead end, so to speak, that I encounter oftentimes in future histories when talking to

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:59.520
different people about, yeah, also questions of democratic planning and the like. And since the artwork allows itself a bit more of, I would say, speculative slack, maybe, I thought maybe you encountered interesting approaches around this question. So the dead end comes in when, as I said, thinking about democratic planning.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:29.160
But in relation to a, I would say, relational materialist thinking, meaning that you do want to establish structures of democratic planning, but without falling back into essentialist notions of truth, essentialist notions of the individual, the human individual, the human subject, but instead work towards an expanded notion of what the, what this democratic polis might be, you know, expanding it to include non-human actors.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:49.160
The more than human in general, more than human nature, but also, of course, possibly technological environments and stuff like that. So maybe one could speak of a government of things where things are not thought of only as objects, but from a perspective of relational materialism.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:16.880
So, but this then kind of brings up the question how to, again, maybe design the polis, how to design this space beyond relying on human subjects as its nucleus, you know? So a non, more than human government of things as democracy. What would that look like?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:26.440
And I've asked many different people and I didn't get very far yet. I have some clues, some leads, but I would be interested. What do you think about it?

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:52.240
Well, yeah, I'm definitely going to just claim at this run. So again, my role is to synthesize things that I have a reasonable sense of adjacency to and a reasonable sense that I can speak to them meaningfully and, you know, add value in my reification towards at least of capturing an essence of something that I feel able to capture.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:04:16.240
And this is also where I would come to this question from is that I think a lot of people, maybe like yourself, look for political imaginaries and technological spaces for designing community that outside of what the dominant political fantasies and actualities are.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:36.520
And certainly in the art world and in the cultural space, often, then there's a question of who is designing those spaces and who is in charge of making those decisions. And yeah, you point out, you know, human and non-human actors.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:05:04.520
There are whole understandings of the world that are old, that include ways of understanding these things that are coming from the culture that is not the people in California that we've been talking about, nor the political theorists that we've been referring to during this conversation, that often come from communities that have been disempowered by these things.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:29.520
Exactly that trajectory of actors, right? So again, I'm going to come back to my upbringing and my geographical understanding of the world, which was from New Zealand. And, you know, Maori and Pacific indigenous communities have been have ways of understanding the world and actors within it.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:52.520
Across human and non-human spaces and, indeed, explicit political and technological paradigms for, you know, working and ordering the world and being an actor in it that works very well for a long time.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:21.520
Prior to the cultural spaces that we occupy, and we are part of antagonizing, right? And I think certainly in the art world, a lot of attention and reallocation of resources is going towards recognizing and trying to grapple with how to include those types of understandings of the world more productively in the way that we see them.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.520
In the type of cultural design space that we're occupying and coming from.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:33.520
That's a very carefully worded answer because it's a very tricky space.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:44.520
And I've made my own attempts to come into dialogue with people that know more than me about those ways of understanding technology and understanding the world.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:07:06.520
I did a big project in New Zealand with a thinker architect that I really admire called Karamia Muller, who comes from a Samoan background, not only, but, you know, her world of expertise is indigenous space, indigenous understandings of space from a Pacific perspective.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:18.520
And we made an exhibition together, a group exhibition together of objects that came both from a crypto design space and a kind of an understanding of a lineage of design from crypto histories.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:26.520
Interestingly, her uncle is Swiss as well as Samoan.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.520
There's an interesting colonial history there.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:40.520
And he is also the founder of a very important set of banking infrastructure that was adjacent to the birth of crypto in Switzerland and its interaction with the world mainstream finance.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:50.520
So he was the legal actor that designed the possibilities for the launch of Ethereum in dialogue with Vitalik.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.520
And he founded a very important crypto bank called Signum, which a lot of crypto projects use.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:22.520
And, you know, it was really interesting to antagonize that history and put it alongside other Pacific histories and other Pacific adjacent actors thinking about community and design and what agency was in terms of technology, what technology indeed mean, who was able to claim the technological, who was able to design political space, and what power structures meant in that.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:42.520
So this is maybe a more detailed answer than you want, but I do think that those are where people in my community find energy to have conversations that look different from monetary incentive design.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.520
But it comes with difficult cultural territory.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:58.520
It comes with an admission and a reckoning with oneself that if you're in that design space, as a white guy like me, you might not be leading that design space, right?

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:07.520
You can't just simply appropriate those structures of design and work on top of them as your own.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:17.520
And that involves a different understanding of agency and collaboration than I was certainly used to before I tried to engage in those kinds of conversations.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:27.520
And it leads to conversations that sound very different to the one that you and I have had today with also different pace and a different understanding of where value lies, etc.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:47.520
So I guess maybe my takeaway from that experience and continuing to think in this space is that maybe even the way that you and I are describing design as a part of the problematics that we're encountering that are cultural, technological, political, right?

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:57.520
So we might have to de-center ourselves if we want to make space for things that are other than that.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:19.520
Absolutely. And I mean, the way that I kind of asked for how to bring about socio-technical imaginaries can easily be understood as if I was thinking that this would be as easy and as if this would be desirable in such a quasi top-down fashion, which of course I'm not.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.520
But I totally understand that.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.520
Yeah, the colonial and all of these things come back, right?

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:45.520
And I think part of where my research also sits and often encounters is that the way that language and narrative is crafted from California has a long history, has a lot of continuity with things that seem often when new products are proposed to be very far away.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:11:07.520
But yeah, I mean, you don't have to look very far once you reframe the lens into the language of frontiers, hero stories of saviors coming and designing things that enable everybody else to be subjects, etc.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.520
These things are deep, cool stories that we tell and retell and package and repackage.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:25.520
And there I think we can meaningfully use the word we, because I think it is people like you and me that are that infrastructure in our bodies and our minds.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.520
Absolutely.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:43.520
This all kind of really nicely relates to the last episode of Future History is actually where I had Elisa Long Cone Antilleo as a guest, who is a Mapuche leader and was involved in the constitutional process of recently in Chile.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:57.520
Maybe, I mean, we are having this conversation as part of the, let's say, extended exhibition program of your show Metaverse Landscapes at the Kunstverein Hannover.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.520
So maybe let's have a little promo block at least.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:05.520
What are you investigating with this specific work of yours, the Metaverse Landscapes?

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.520
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't need to be a promo block actually, because it flows on very well from the conversation we're having.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:33.520
My work, again, my role as an artist is I think to kind of try and take these feelings and observations that I have and dialogue with my various different conversations that I have and kind of make it into compelling objects that make sense within the context which I deploy them in the history of art and contemporary art making.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:46.520
And so I've made a series of paintings, which is a format that art has, that has been at the center of a certain type of art for a very long time, and modernism obviously is one of those.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:54.520
And, and also landscape painting has been something that I've been thinking about a lot in relation to exactly these questions, right.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:15.520
So, growing up in New Zealand, the first thing that I learned in art history class was about settler landscapes of New Zealand from European painters, and those European painters took the aesthetic language of Europe, and sort of like, you know, exported it, dragged and dropped it on top of,

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:41.520
quote unquote, new spaces and lands, and they produced these images that were reproduced throughout the settler communities that were looking towards New Zealand, and that formed imaginaries in the minds of those settlers who would move there and start buying and selling land as, you know, as broken up pieces of property,

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:52.520
and also just simply occupy those spaces and cultivate them in cultural and technological ways that Europe had been before, right.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:14:08.520
So, so I saw the role of the artists, which were often commissioned by, you know, private companies that did the early work of the colonial establishment that also had, by the way, you know, financial structures, which are very important to the history of modernism within them,

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:32.520
joint stock companies, etc., you know, were part of colonial projects and, you know, absorbed into sovereign states after they'd kind of created these products out of the colonies they were producing, and artists produced these imageries which sort of captured some of the imaginaries of what those spaces were becoming, what they might become, and kind of political and financial possibilities of those lands.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:50.520
And I thought, hmm, that happening at the same time as I was looking at crypto assets a lot, thinking about the emergence of, you know, being able to own parts of the internet, maybe one could say that there's a sort of similar parceling up of what has been a commons into a space that you can now own and trade.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:15:08.520
And certainly that was made very explicit in metaverses where you could buy and sell properties in various different metaverses which were scarce and ways of pictorially imagining what those spaces might look like and what might be possible in them, which also drew on histories of image making.

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:33.520
So if you buy a property in a prominent Ethereum adjacent metaverse like Decentraland, you buy a gridded image with a red dot in the middle of a sort of a part of a top down map, which looks like a grid to those who are trained in understanding modernist painting history.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:43.520
The grid on a square is a very important trope and was also adjacent to processing rationalized town planning.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:57.520
I'm thinking about painters like Piet Mondrian and very well known paintings like Broadway Boogie Woogie, which were of the kind of Manhattan grid or derived from the Manhattan grid and then went out into abstraction.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:07.520
And I was thinking, huh, maybe there's a similar role that I can play as a neo-colonial painter of these spaces that are being packaged and settled.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:33.520
So I've made modernist-esque paintings of existing properties in various metaverses, including Decentraland, which look at once like mid-century abstract grid painting and are indeed pictures of landscape properties that are being speculated on in this kind of neo-colonial environment that we're kind of experiencing with the growth of metaverses.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:45.520
And maybe the inevitability of capitalism moving on into virtual spaces as we reach the limits to what is possible in the kind of physical world, let's say.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:17:01.520
And so with those paintings of other people's properties that I've put in this exhibition, I also issued a new token that comes with each painting, which tracks the owner of that property that your painting depicts.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:09.520
So when you look at the painting that you see on the wall of the museum, or indeed if you own one at home, you're looking at a depiction of somebody else's property.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:18.520
And you can always scan the side of the painting where I've put a little QR code in to see who the owner of that property is at any given time.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:27.520
And also to see where the development of that property is going, because these metaverses change interfaces, they grow, they subdivide in different ways.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:36.520
Different actors do different things with various plots, and often those are reflected on the token itself that is the kind of proof of ownership of that property.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:48.520
So you can kind of have your painting of a certain moment in the early development of these early settled lands, and then you can also see where the kind of current development is at in these moments.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:58.520
So yeah, this is also about, I guess, exploring the continuities of these technological paradigms as they emerge.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:07.520
Fantastic. Simon, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests, and it is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:22.520
Ah, that's a great question. So I'm always thinking about the future, and especially in the role of being in touch with artists who are always trying to make new things and think about things in different ways.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:43.520
So what makes me joyful about the future is those special moments that I'm going to have learning about these artists' projects and how they reframe and package the world in moving ways, which help me understand and relate to what's going on, both in technology, politics and culture.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.520
Wonderful. Simon, thank you so much for being part of Future Histories.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:54.520
Thank you very much, Jan. It's been a real pleasure, and you're a fantastic conversation partner. It's really productive for me. Thank you.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.520
Thank you so much.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.520
I might like it as well. Thanks a lot and hear you in two weeks.
