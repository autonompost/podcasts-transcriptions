0	7520	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groß and it is my great pleasure to welcome Simon Denny in today's episode.
7520	13680	Simon is an artist and professor for time-based media at the HFBK Hamburg.
13680	24880	This episode came together as part of the extended exhibition program of the double exhibition by Simon Denny and Agnieszka Kurant at Kunstverein Hannover.
24880	36880	And I want to say thanks to Christoph Platzgalus, director of the Kunstverein, for making this possible and to Sarah Morais dos Santos-Brus for connecting me to Christoph.
36880	41880	This has been a great pleasure and I really enjoyed talking to Simon, I have to say.
41880	50880	Before we start, I want to welcome Max as a Patreon of Future Histories and now please enjoy today's episode with Simon Denny.
55880	57880	Welcome Simon.
57880	59880	Thank you very much Jan, it's a pleasure to be here.
59880	61880	Pleasure to have you.
61880	71880	Simon, in your work you often investigate different tech imaginaries and the related cultures as well, but let's start with a focus on the imaginary specifically.
72880	84880	What is it that you're investigating when looking at these tech imaginaries, which arguably are not only tech imaginaries, but also always already political imaginaries and economic imaginaries as well?
84880	86880	Well, thanks for the question.
86880	92880	And I think it's one that I think I constantly revisit.
92880	98880	I think I started working on this rather intuitively quite a long time ago.
98880	110880	So I grew up in New Zealand and I moved to Germany where I now live and work around 2007 and I went to an art school in Frankfurt there, the Städelschule, which is connected to the Städel Museum.
110880	114880	And at that time I already had a practice of sorts.
114880	116880	It was my kind of second degree.
116880	122880	I'd already started a gallery and had many peers and interests as an artist.
122880	134880	But one major thing that hit that year was the iPhone and I guess also the scaling of infrastructure like Facebook.
134880	146880	And I just found as somebody who was moving from one community to another, from one locale to another, suddenly the importance of my personal tech stack became very important to me.
146880	148880	It was a communication device, a learning device.
148880	151880	These interfaces just took over my experience.
151880	169880	And at the same time I was around artists who were looking back to the history of how contemporary artists have often, during modernism being, making work which was sort of dealing with the experience or the feeling of technologies as they hit life.
169880	186880	So even early 20th century or late 19th century artists were making work about how technology feels and often in the face of new technological consumer environments and paradigms.
186880	203880	And so I was thinking about people like working in futurism data around the First World War and I was thinking also about mid-century people encountering television and different types of broadcast environments.
203880	209880	So there were a lot of art being made trying to process what these things felt like.
209880	225880	And I guess with the onset of mobile and web to social platforms and user generated content and all of that, I realized that there was another major thing going on and a toolkit to be able to kind of process that culturally.
225880	231880	But I sort of realized that intuitively because I was just involved in all these things.
231880	250880	And I realized also that the conversations that I had among my peers were as much informed by art history and what artists were making as they were by new software and communication strategies that were being shared as a kind of a platform.
250880	264880	So yeah, long story short, I started focusing more and more on who was telling those stories and who was making those platforms because it seemed to be quite important for what they were.
264880	269880	And so I started to go to technology conferences as well as art events.
269880	285880	And I started to speak to and seek out technology founders and listen to their stories and ways of understanding the world culturally and try to kind of process that aesthetically and visually and but also politically.
285880	313880	And yeah, so I guess that's what started me on this path of looking to technological imaginaries or tech imaginaries as ease to understanding contemporary experience and then trying to place that as or process that as art experiences that made sense with the history of how artists have interfaced with these things in the past.
313880	315880	Is that your question?
315880	323880	Yeah, it does. Maybe you could give us an example of one of your works where you specifically try to aim at these imaginaries.
323880	336880	Yeah, so I think the first one that I really remember that I felt really worked was a show that I produced in Munich in 2012-13.
336880	342880	So I went to a technology conference, which is quite well known in this part of the world, the DLD, Digital Life Design.
342880	363880	It's put on by Voodoo Media and it's been going since I think about 2005 or 2006 and has often had kind of major technology founders, particularly from the US and Europe, but only also from Asia and different parts of the world as well, come through on their way to Davos.
363880	375880	It happens a few days before Davos and they come and often people that organize it were able to capture founders at the moments when their products were really scaling.
375880	383880	So Mark Zuckerberg was there at the moment when Facebook was just getting user numbers that were breaking the records and scaling.
383880	388880	And so the year that I sort of first encountered this was 2012-13.
388880	406880	And I was given a bunch of the material that recorded all of the conversations that were happening that year and Jack Dorsey was there, Jimmy Wales was there, Pavel Durov was there, among many other people, Drew Houston.
406880	414880	So founders of Twitter, Dropbox, Wikipedia, Telegram, etc.
414880	417880	Prior to Telegram, it was Vcontact back then.
417880	438880	But yeah, so a number of tech founders basically telling their peers what their vision was for the world and what they saw the world as and what their business and technological toolkit for capturing and exploiting that was going to be.
438880	442880	And I found that event really moving. I found it very affecting.
442880	445880	I was really, I'd never been in an environment like that before.
445880	452880	And I found it overwhelming and challenging and inspiring at the same time.
452880	457880	So I was sort of confused, but I had very strong actions to it.
457880	478880	And then I worked on an artwork that kind of transcribed and took quotes from that process, from those conversations and put them alongside contemporary interface design and printed a bunch of graphic panels that were sort of summaries of each talk.
478880	502880	And then made a kind of a maze in a space called the Munich Kunstverein, where, you know, viewers would walk in a sort of a 3D extension-like environment, like you would if you were stuck in iron, and then be confronted with all of these bombardments of statements and quips about the world and about where technology was going to take us.
502880	512880	So that was kind of the first time I did that, that piece then toured to the U.S. and to New Zealand and to Mini Pinale and other types of things.
512880	524880	And I think that's when I really found my way of, you know, taking really seriously the propositions of business and technology thinkers as keys to understanding culture in our world today.
524880	530880	Let's maybe dig a little bit deeper into this emotional aspect, because this is very interesting to me.
530880	545880	And I'm wondering whether one might maybe connect it to the question of aesthetics in the sense of maybe an aesthetics of imagination, because I mean, of course, aesthetics plays a huge role in all of this.
545880	548880	You know, it's on the level of technological artifacts.
548880	552880	It's on the level of the performance on the stage of these conferences.
552880	558880	It's, for example, meme culture, like being picked up in the blockchain space, stuff like that.
558880	568880	But it's also on the level of imagination as well, I would say, because these imaginations of future, they have to be kind of aesthetically coherent.
568880	571880	They have to be desirable, so to speak.
571880	579880	So there is kind of a realm of treating our imagination of alternative futures as if it was a design space, you know?
579880	583880	So, I mean, they themselves might even not be aware of that.
583880	590880	But there is this question that you have to address, because if you do not address it, people won't kind of pick up on it.
590880	599880	You know, it has to be aesthetic and it has to be desirable or it has to be aesthetic in order to become desirable.
599880	609880	So this is really interesting to me because it also points towards a certain effort that we will have to engage with if we think about alternatives as well.
609880	613880	So I would be interested in your thoughts about this.
613880	624880	Yeah, I mean, in my experience, these types of, you know, the more I looked into exactly this question of, you know, was this a design space?
624880	628880	And if it was, how deliberate a design space is it?
628880	635880	And how are those who are in charge of producing future technological consumer paradigms?
635880	647880	How much do they think about the design space of the imaginaries of their potential clients, which is everybody everywhere all at once, you know?
647880	651880	And I would say in my experience, it's quite explicit.
651880	662880	And quite, you know, I learned more and more just how rich and imaginary these people draw on.
662880	667880	I mean, it's in one way culturally specific and often quite politically specific.
667880	675880	It's often coming from a broadly speaking conservative view frame of the world.
675880	686880	And some are quite conservative, tending towards quite right wing ideas of what politics should be, but not always.
686880	690880	But it's also culturally specific, right?
691880	700880	I guess again, as somebody growing up in New Zealand, I'm very aware of the histories of colonialism and the fact that I come from a history of certainly colonialism.
700880	702880	I'm a white New Zealander.
702880	712880	And, you know, I grew up among a very awkward understanding of the fact that my forefathers had come and essentially expropriated a bunch of land
712880	724880	and, you know, exported an idea of politics and culture and resources and, you know, whatever capitalism onto a space that prior to that was governed by different people in different ways with different values.
724880	734880	And, you know, so I guess I was aware of the fact that when these imaginaries were coming from California and were framed from a bunch of people that looked like me,
734880	739880	that it was again a very culturally specific vision that was being exported and that felt familiar.
739880	751880	And, yeah, also, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but connected to other types of things that I've been looking at culturally in the world anyway.
751880	761880	You know, I think the art world, especially New Zealand when I grew up there, but also in many other places around the world was thinking exactly about these things about which cultural voices had scale
761880	768880	and which were important for imaginaries of culture and political imaginaries and all these other things.
768880	772880	So, yeah, I guess they all kind of connected in my mind.
772880	782880	But, yeah, I mean, even if you just look at Apple, right, you want one of the economical technology companies of the past 50 years.
783880	797880	The, you know, the design thinking thing that is centric to them is obviously understood as a huge part of why they think they themselves are successful, right?
797880	820880	The mythologizing of Johnny Ive and these types of, you know, design focused, aesthetics focused, product design, simplicity, drawing on the history of modernism, all of that is, I think, everybody in that world understands that to be one of the key things of why Apple is so hedonic.
820880	829880	So, yeah, that's one example, but I think there's other examples as well, also from different parts of the, or slightly different parts of the political spectrum.
829880	842880	You know, one of the kind of key arcs of my investigation for the last few years has also been into the political universe around PayPal, Founders Fund, Peter Thiel.
842880	848880	And that's a slightly different, I think, political imaginary than the one that surrounds Apple.
848880	857880	Obviously, there's a lot of similarities as well, but I think there's a different ideological design space there that is aesthetic in a different way, right?
857880	867880	It's not drawing on the same strands of modernism that Apple is, but it is drawing on frontier imaginaries.
867880	878880	It is drawing on, you know, IQ and, you know, race science and things like that really explicitly at different moments in its expression.
878880	899880	So, yeah, I don't know if, again, that's an answer, but I think all of the very powerful people who are at the center of those projects really think a lot about designing inventories in the heads of their clients, users, publics.
899880	904880	So you would say this is very much deliberate on their part, so you would say that somebody...
904880	906880	That's my opinion.
906880	907880	Interesting.
907880	908880	That's my experience.
908880	930880	So you would say that someone like Peter Thiel, for example, you know, not only kind of has an ideological foundation that he builds his kind of worldview upon and then tries to bring this into the world and into actually being through force by capital, so to speak.
930880	940880	But that he kind of reflects upon this aspect of narrative in a, let's say, aesthetic or design frame, so to speak.
940880	941880	That's my understanding.
941880	944880	And I don't think I'm alone in this interpretation of the project.
944880	956880	And I think it becomes more and more visible as you get kind of discourses around, you know, pathways through subculture to producing value as well, which is a more recent turn, I think, in that in that milieu,
956880	970880	whereby there's explicit projects to build publics within traditionally avant-garde cultural spaces to kind of like seed political imaginaries more explicitly.
970880	982880	And again, like, I think I don't want to come across as if I think that, you know, powerful people in California can design the world top down and that they know that that's all possible.
982880	990880	I think it's very haphazard at the same time, but I don't think that contradicts the fact that it's I think that's the part of the project.
990880	993880	I think that's an explicit part of the design space of the project, right?
993880	998880	I think there's many attempts by many companies to do many things in terms of create a culture.
998880	1005880	I mean, you hear projects a lot talk about community, producing community and community being one of the key things to seed a product, right?
1005880	1009880	If you don't have community, then you don't have a way to scale.
1009880	1021880	And I think that is a, you know, that's a common project across many kind of Silicon Valley-ish things working in that tradition, right?
1021880	1029880	I think most people who are in the space of designing those projects know that they don't always work and there's an amount of luck and haphazardness and synergy.
1029880	1043880	You know, so I don't I don't claim to have the idea that there are kind of people who even very powerful people who are able to sit at the center of thing and completely design it and sort of just press the go button on a Goldberg machine.
1043880	1045880	And suddenly there's a political paradigm or whatever.
1045880	1048880	I don't think they think that and I don't think that's possible.
1048880	1057880	But I do think that explicitly designing imaginaries is a part of producing publics that produce products that are sustained by political paradigms.
1057880	1066880	Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, and of course, I mean, there are also historical examples where this has been done quite successfully.
1066880	1084880	There's the Montpeleris Society where the neoliberals very early on kind of had a roadmap how to implement these types of ideas into the public sphere and kind of were quite successful in executing their plans as well.
1085880	1087880	So, of course, it's not and these people.
1087880	1092880	Yeah, no, exactly. But and these people are explicit students of those projects.
1092880	1100880	You know, like one of I mean, I've been lucky enough to see, you know, some of these really key actors play into this world a little bit.
1100880	1104880	I was I was a guest at the Montpeleris Society meet up at the Hoover Institution.
1104880	1106880	No shit.
1106880	1110880	2020 and the keynote speaker was Peter Thiel.
1110880	1127880	And, you know, there's a there's a there's a key there's a there's a real literacy, I think, in certain parts of the communities that make these incredible products and incredible politics and publics that knows what they're drawing on, you know.
1127880	1129880	And at that meeting was incredible.
1129880	1141880	There was also a kind of a show of the Hoover Institution Archive of Milton Friedman's work, which is, again, I think, another really important milestone in this cultural arc.
1141880	1145880	And and also Frigida Kayak's founding of the Montpeleris Society.
1145880	1156880	There was an incredible relic there and I'm very attracted to material relics in my work sculpture and a painter and I work a lot with making exhibitions and making objects as well as making digital things.
1156880	1164880	And there was a really compelling object at that meet up that I'll never forget that I think kind of contains some of the, you know, what we're talking about.
1164880	1177880	There was a kind of a giant tablecloth with the signatories of all of the founders of the Montpeleris Society sewn into it, which is a part of the Hoover Institution's Archive of Hayek's.
1177880	1191880	So, you know, I think, you know, this is this is the world that I find fascinating because these objects I think are just their values, but I think they're slightly undervalued in terms of their role and importance in our kind of cultural world.
1191880	1192880	Very interesting.
1192880	1201880	Very interesting. And what would you say? Because, I mean, there had been a certain roadmap back then when Montpeleris Society was founded.
1201880	1206880	What would you say? What are the shifts that took place?
1206880	1217880	Not really since then, but what are the essential shifts that the generation that is active right now, so to speak, maybe see different and enact differently?
1217880	1226880	I mean, not the least because there are, of course, also different kind of affordances through the technological stack that is now available.
1226880	1234880	And they obviously do use it quite actively, the potential and try to kind of bring it to their use.
1234880	1248880	So how did they shift this perspective? Maybe do they have different types of approaches when they try to imagine the enactment of these imaginaries?
1248880	1252880	I mean, that question, I'm probably not qualified to answer.
1252880	1261880	I mean, I can speculate what I think might be the case, but I don't have concrete answers of the explicit differences.
1261880	1264880	You know, I'm neither an economic historian nor, you know, I'm an artist.
1264880	1278880	Right. So I sort of do embedded projects to try and understand communities and kind of pull out aesthetic moments that capture and reify some of what I think is an important vibe.
1278880	1282880	Right. That's my level of qualification and my kind of what I can actually claim that I do.
1282880	1292880	Right. All of this other stuff around it, this rhetorical material and my speculations on various different business strategies is kind of amateur work.
1292880	1304880	Right. But yeah, I mean, I think to my mind, there would be a very sophisticated understanding of what's possible in terms of where we are with the technology stack at the moment.
1304880	1319880	I think anybody involved in a VC community as influential as Founders Fund or Teal Capital or even Andreessen Horowitz, you know, is an incredible attractor of information of what's possible technologically and what might be possible coming technologically.
1319880	1323880	So I think that that's definitely an important arm of their political apparatus.
1323880	1330880	Let's say if you were building a political project as we think these people might be doing, certainly you would be considering that.
1330880	1334880	And there's definitely very, very good information coming to you first all the time.
1334880	1339880	Right. Because you offer money to found and support these projects as they grow.
1339880	1365880	Right. So that's it. I think that that combination between financial leverage and power translated into an information stream of kind of like a continual updating and evolving of understanding what is possible in terms of communication networks, financial infrastructures, and then possible ramifications of what those are becoming might be.
1365880	1372880	And I think all of that is an incredible tool that people like Hayek and even Friedman probably wouldn't have had access to. Right.
1372880	1392880	So I think there's I think that's also a real difference maybe between, again, from my amateur understanding of the kind of technology founder of yesteryear and the adjacency to politics and the kind of political environment that they might have been operating in the mid
1392880	1411880	20th century, even an Intel or a, you know, and a kind of a more contemporary figure also like Elon Musk or something like that, who one gets the sense to Elon Musk and these types of actors are maybe sometimes even political and rhetorical first, you know,
1411880	1430880	that's at least my interpretation of it. Right. So I think you could you could argue that a figure like Elon Musk understands as good as anybody else, but possibly better than most people, why Twitter is valuable, and Twitter is a valuable tool rhetorically and politically as much as it is financially, you know,
1430880	1445880	And I think he is an actor that seemingly continually iterates and experiments on how that tool can be deployed to his advantage, both as a businessman, but also as a growing attractor of political power.
1445880	1460880	So, you know, so I don't know if that's on topic or off topic argument, but I think I think the Yeah, the tools and availabilities now compared to, you know, when even in the mid century, so even 50 years after even in the data era, right.
1460880	1481880	When when it's arguable that Mont Pelerin's, you know, labors finally sort of came into mainstream political usage between Thatcher and Reagan, and sometimes explicitly, I'm sure you'll know that Thatcher, you know, really embraced Hayek, you know, also nominal.
1481880	1492880	But, yeah, I think I think that there's a big difference in terms of, of what's possible now, you know, and, yeah.
1492880	1520880	And I mean, there are big differences in terms of what is possible now, not only for them, but hopefully also for us, I would say. So I would be also interested in what could desirable alternatives on this level of abstraction on the level of, let's say, socio-technical imaginaries, and what could they look like, and what would you say how, again, how conscious of an effort it can actually be to develop these imaginaries?
1521880	1541880	Well, yeah, I mean, again, just to situate my answer, again, I'm an artist, not a, not a political thinker. I mean, you know, I think about politics, but I'm not a, I don't design policy. I'm not in dialogue with people that, you know, spend all their time and, you know, become very well informed about what may or may not work.
1542880	1570880	You know, so, so just to qualify my answer, but I'm sure it's possible to imagine using these types of environments and apparatuses to different political ends. It must be logically possible, right? I think the difficulty with that seems to be, to me, that a part of all of that is, is also centralized power and leverage.
1570880	1585880	That it's hard to replicate, right? And this is, this has, I guess, synergies and rhymes with conversations around AI, you know, again, as I pay attention to various different conversations that surround various different technologies.
1585880	1609880	We are now in a, in a hype cycle that focuses on the promise of AI, but one of the qualifiers that always comes with that, and I think you see that in terms of spending and resource allocation and personnel decisions, everything that's affecting the technology community right now, that, you know, very few, very big actors are really at the center of being able to deploy these tools.
1610880	1625880	And I think that's somewhat true with the world of political imaginaries and arms of technology that I was describing as well, you know, so while I hope that there's ways that people who have different politics could get access to those design spaces.
1625880	1646880	I think it's a formidable task to overcome centralized power like that, as it's, as it's become centralized, you know, where I got excited again, as a, as a kind of cultural lightning rod and and rare fire along the way all of these stories was was around crypto.
1646880	1656880	And I spent quite a lot of time as crypto emerged, thinking and being excited about the fact that alternative financial power structures were being explicitly designed.
1656880	1662880	And with them, there were various rhetorical and ideological spaces also emerging.
1662880	1678880	I enjoyed seeing a full political spectrum of those emerging around blockchains. So I saw right libertarianism, of course, heap various different visions on top of those infrastructures and thrive.
1678880	1703880	But I also saw really interesting people come out of activism from the left emerge from protest movements from the, you know, mid 2000s, like, like Occupy people coming from those types of histories also attracted to designing through blockchains through the idea that designable money spaces might, you know, open up different political opportunities.
1704880	1711880	We're at a moment in the hype cycle in the blockchain story and the political imagination surrounding the blockchain story, which is quite low.
1711880	1727880	There's a lot of pessimism. And I think that's got a lot to do with the fact that there's been many scammers and actors exposed new new technological spaces always have potential upsides for incredible amounts of arbitrage.
1727880	1734880	And this is often where people accrue power at the beginnings of those new technological paradigm deployments.
1734880	1748880	And yeah, and with that becomes a kind of gray, gray area legally that people often try and capture the surplus from think Airbnb and Uber and very kind of banal versions, right?
1748880	1754880	Things that were sort of not quite legal suddenly became an opportunity to capture a whole huge market sector.
1754880	1767880	And therefore a power base. And I think in blockchains, there was a huge amount of possibilities for that and a really long period of time when it was a gray market and it still kind of is even what's firming up right now.
1768880	1787880	You know, certainly this is this allowed for the growth of DeFi and all these other kind of projects and yeah, and huge opportunities for scammers, which are now kind of meeting regulation as as the world of financial regulation catches up with catches up with those projects.
1788880	1799880	A lot of yeah, a lot of disappointing stories come out of the blockchain space and therefore make it less of an attractive space for political narratives as well at the moment.
1799880	1806880	But let's see, maybe maybe things could could change along that environment as well.
1806880	1810880	I want to dig a little bit deeper into this question of the recent history.
1810880	1816880	But before that, just because you like now a second time try to situate rightly.
1816880	1822880	So try to situate your answer and and pointed out that you are quote unquote, just an artist.
1822880	1828880	For me, that's that's one of the reasons why I ask you these specific questions around aesthetics of imagination and stuff like that.
1828880	1844880	And of course, because you very much engage with these imaginaries in your work in general, before we move on to digging a little deeper into this recent history, I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into this question of alternative imaginary still, because I mean,
1844880	1853880	One question would also be that coming from your like deep engagement with the existing socio-technical imaginaries.
1853880	1872880	Do you think there are certain maybe leverage points or certain fields that can and should be addressed by any alternative socio-technical imaginary in order to maybe also become as desirable,
1872880	1884880	you know, to kind of put it back to this question of that it needs to be desirable, you know, because I more and more come to the conclusion that this is like really, really, really crucial.
1884880	1891880	You know, because within future histories, for example, I very much engage with this question of democratic planning and how this could be brought about.
1891880	1893880	I engage with these different models and so on.
1893880	1895880	And of course, this is all important.
1895880	1898880	And the theory behind these models is important, too.
1898880	1904880	But I oftentimes get to this point where I think, oh, wait a second.
1904880	1908880	I mean, of course, it's important to have a theoretical discussion about this.
1908880	1923880	But this construction of alternative imaginaries in relation to desires is even as important as this theoretical discussion about, you know, comprehensive models of democratic planning.
1923880	1928880	So do you think that there are certain, how do you say, Hebel?
1928880	1930880	You speak German? Do you speak German?
1930880	1931880	Certain leverage points.
1931880	1937880	Yeah, certain leverage points to go about this task, you know?
1937880	1940880	Yeah, I mean, I think there are.
1940880	1942880	And I think that's a fair question.
1942880	1962880	And I think that actually oftentimes, you know, these very intelligent thinkers that we've been referring to before that have been in charge of very successful products see these spaces and develop them really effectively.
1962880	1963880	Right.
1963880	1975880	And so I think message boards in the 90s and the 2000s were kind of cedars of potential possibilities for politics and culture.
1975880	1992880	And I think that in those imaginaries were born possibilities that played out culturally, right, that started with culture first and then kind of, or started with a particular, I don't want to be determinist in where things begin.
1992880	1993880	Maybe that's the wrong way to put it.
1993880	2001880	But I think that certainly, you know, certain moments have been recognized to kind of coalesce certain politics, right?
2001880	2015880	So let's say to put a concrete name on it, let's say that there was a kind of a conservative meme factory produced within 4chan, right?
2015880	2017880	Let's make it simple like that.
2017880	2022880	And that was a combination of a cultural force and a technological paradigm.
2022880	2037880	And various people on the left also recognize that that was happening, particularly in the Trump run up to the Trump era and how important that felt culturally during that era of his first run to presidency.
2037880	2046880	I remember a lot of conversations and analysis going into why 4chan was able to produce, you know, Trump supporting memes and political narratives.
2046880	2068880	And I think that those same communities seem to be popping up in avant-garde art adjacent and cultural adjacent circles now and funding small offline communities and pumping quite a lot of resources and space into those situations and glamour.
2068880	2096880	And I think that part of the apparatus of what art can produce is sort of some kind of synthesis of money, glamour and seeding ideas through events and small communities that then kind of scale into larger conversations and often take place in geographical centers of money in certain parts of our empire, let's say.
2096880	2107880	And I don't see as much of that same recognition of that power being as organized in circles around the left.
2107880	2120880	So I think there would be an opportunity there for getting money and resources together and kind of seeding political spaces that are adjacent to art and glamour in the way that those spaces are.
2120880	2126880	And I think a lot of the actors that, you know, I'm also a teacher in art school, so I see the beginnings of some of these conversations.
2126880	2134880	It's very normal for art school students to band together and produce very authentic, interesting, exciting, glamorous young spaces.
2134880	2140880	But those spaces often, especially today, are running away from running out of money sources.
2140880	2149880	And I think from the kind of political sector and the political left, there used to be a lot more, especially in Europe, available to support these structures.
2149880	2153880	I think in Germany, it's still done a pretty good job of doing that.
2153880	2161880	But I know in other parts of the Anglosphere, it's definitely not as easy to do these things as it used to be.
2161880	2165880	And those things used to seed, I think, important political things.
2165880	2172880	And it was a space for starting ideas and creating the kind of momentum necessary to scale ideas very organically.
2173880	2180880	I'm sure you know the term, again, from the kind of chat room world of the idea of force memeing, right?
2180880	2184880	The idea that a meme can't be designed top down.
2184880	2199880	It has to be a bottom up experience and something about architecture and the personnel that went into producing memes in 4chan that really scaled was a special piece of magic that was very, very hard to reproduce in other types of environments.
2199880	2206880	Even if somebody put the kind of seemingly the same ingredients together, it didn't often produce the same stickiness and scale.
2206880	2211880	And I think that that's also true with kind of culture.
2211880	2215880	You can't sort of top down force meme avant-garde art either.
2215880	2220880	It sort of has to be a bottom up experience that then gets kind of picked up at the right time with the right amplifiers.
2220880	2243880	And there's a very special, I think, set of expertise that art schools and the adjacent spaces and kind of arts council funding type arrangements are able to produce and have produced very effectively in the last 50 to 100 years in Britain, America, and New Zealand, these cultures that I'm really familiar with, and also in Germany.
2243880	2258880	So I think that could be an opportunity that is now being exploited by people on the more conservative end of things very explicitly that could be reinvested in by people of other politics.
2258880	2269880	Okay, and then maybe let's bring these two elements together and take another look at this question of recent history when it comes to this relation of the left and tech.
2269880	2285880	Because, I mean, one way to put it might be, or at least of the recent history, you might say that, okay, there was this like 2014, 15 moment where you had this accelerationist manifesto by Srenichek and Williams.
2285880	2298880	You had their book, then afterwards, Inventing the Future, you had the xenofeminist manifesto, Falk, so fully automated luxury communism floated around at this time also.
2298880	2307880	So all of these things kind of popped up trying to maybe renegotiate this question of technology and the left.
2307880	2319880	So there was this, and then I guess some of the kind of cryptosphere, the blockchain space, I would say, maybe leached upon this energy.
2319880	2331880	Some of the energy that came out of this, I would say, also kind of went into the blockchain sphere in this, as you already pointed towards an enthusiasm around, for example, DAOs and stuff like that.
2331880	2341880	And I, for one, remain a little skeptical whether or not this did the whole thing really a favor or not.
2341880	2356880	But apart from this question, whether or not the cryptosphere was leaching parts of this energy, I would say that there's also arguably another aspect to this accelerationist moment
2356880	2363880	that kind of takes apart in why it has to be rethought, I would say.
2363880	2377880	And this is the more or less, not completely, but more or less unreflected or, let's say, not sufficiently reflected inherent problems with Promethean progressivism, so to speak.
2377880	2387880	So I would say, of course, the accelerationists had some valid points when it comes to what they called folk politics, so to speak.
2387880	2397880	Then on the other side, again, I think, for example, the question of ecology or the ecological question kind of is a crystallization point,
2397880	2411880	also for why this kind of Promethean progressivism in its kind of unreflected form also cannot lead to sufficient answers, so to speak.
2411880	2417880	So this might be a way to frame the very recent history, so to speak.
2417880	2428880	And I would be interested whether either you agree with this framing and then what do you think, what's the point where we are at right now?
2428880	2437880	I think you already kind of pointed towards this aspect that AI, because of the way that the infrastructure is built,
2437880	2444880	kind of has a tendency or a strong tendency towards centralization, and that's an aspect of it.
2444880	2455880	But maybe you could elaborate a bit more on what you think is the point where we are at right now when it comes to this question of the left and tech.
2455880	2461880	Yeah, again, I'll make a stab at it from my armchair.
2461880	2467880	I'm going to say this 10 times on this podcast, but my primary project is producing fantastic artworks.
2467880	2470880	That's what I spend most of my time trying to do.
2470880	2475880	And I feel that a part of that project is informing myself as best as I can about politics and aesthetics and all these things.
2475880	2481880	So I have kind of opinions, but this is not what I put my primary energy into understanding.
2481880	2486880	I try to put all that energy into what makes a great artwork and a great art experience.
2486880	2502880	But having said that disclaimer, I've been really interested in this flow of energy, maybe from accelerationist adjacent things coming from a history of CCRU and those types of thinkers.
2503880	2508880	Again, I think it's really interesting how left-right polarities emerge in this context.
2508880	2515880	So if you take that history, again, and standing of it, you have Sadie Plant on the one side and Nick Land on the other.
2515880	2524880	And that's the sort of framework for the political possibilities within accelerationism and its forebearer.
2524880	2529880	And yeah, I guess with Mark Fisher in the middle.
2530880	2535880	So I think that was the background that I understood accelerationism to be emerging out of.
2535880	2542880	And certainly a group of artists around that as well were kind of interested in Jason and kind of trying to work through the cultural possibilities of that.
2542880	2551880	And that was, I think, broadly what was termed at the time post-internet art actors, which is when I became active and visible also within my own art making.
2551880	2554880	Then crypto, I think, did emerge out of similar communities.
2554880	2563880	And some of the energies and hopes that I saw organizing in the art world around the banner of post-internet and accelerationist thought and questioning it.
2563880	2577880	Often also within art, you have this really productive, I think, space where a lot of things are examined and tried out, even things that one is politically both aligned with and questioning.
2578880	2585880	So you got a sort of a full exploration of the possibilities of those spaces from left to right within art.
2585880	2592880	And I think that was also true and still potentially true within crypto, which is maybe we're at the end of a certain arc.
2592880	2606880	But let's say as the accelerationist question lost its momentum culturally, I think that crypto was becoming more attractive to similar types of people with similar types of questions.
2606880	2618880	Who wanted to look both at the design space of politics and the design space, aesthetics, and then this kind of new foregrounding of the financial design space at the same time.
2618880	2621880	So I think a lot of productive thinking got done around that.
2621880	2628880	And actually there was and still is, I think, a kind of ecological question at the center of that too.
2629880	2636880	Resource questions were always at the center of conversation, certainly from the art perspective around crypto.
2636880	2645880	There was huge debates around whether one could use proof of work or not because it was so energy intensive.
2645880	2650880	And certainly I did a bunch of work that addressed that very directly as well.
2650880	2660880	I found that really compelling. But I had peers alongside me as well that were designing projects that were sort of trying to think about how nature and nature is the wrong word.
2660880	2676880	Let's say non-human actors could interact with markets as a potential space for also designing systems that took into account things that in the, let's say, more mainstream economic world were considered to be externalities.
2676880	2686880	So what if financial things were in dialogue with natural things and those designs could be more synergistic, capturing more of a whole.
2686880	2698880	So I'm thinking about things that happened around project spaces like Trust in Berlin and projects like Terra Zero that were sort of circling around that group of people.
2698880	2713880	They were coming in and out of conversations happening with spaces like Strelka, also kind of design thinking worlds that also interacted with various other art actors at the same time.
2713880	2723880	So I think that was a really productive little moment. And then NFTs as a phenomenon came and blew all that energy apart and sort of confused everybody.
2724880	2739880	Because suddenly there was this, you know, those were all quite modest and small experiments that were happening with crypto and DOWs and stuff prior to 2021 when NFT explosion kind of like took over everybody's attention space.
2739880	2752880	And suddenly there was this sort of casino aspect in there that had been backgrounded that sort of hadn't really been the most important thing for those people who were interested in that design space up until that moment.
2752880	2757880	But then suddenly certain people saw access to capital that they'd never imagined.
2757880	2766880	And I think started to design, you know, products in different ways that sort of addressed value capture financially, much more explicitly.
2766880	2776880	And again, I wouldn't personally describe that as a corruption, but it certainly shifted the focus to value capture and business design.
2776880	2789880	And, you know, again, things that I think are really important actually to solving anything because you can't go on organizing with goodwill alone and the kind of hours that youth allows dries up as one gets older.
2789880	2796880	And, you know, you need more resources to produce thinking and remain sustainable.
2796880	2813880	So, again, I don't think that was a part of the puzzle, but I do think it took some of the narrative emphasis out of some of the more adventurous designing between money, resources and non-human actors and all these kind of urgent questions.
2813880	2829880	And then AI, I think, again, we were at another moment where the recent hype cycle in AI, certainly in the art world, is spurred by access to text to image prompt, consumer facing goods.
2829880	2838880	You know, the AI systems that produce them have been there for a long time, and there's been really productive questions also being asked by various artists around what's possible with AI and what isn't.
2838880	2843880	Also from the political left explicitly.
2843880	2853880	But then suddenly you have all these kind of image prompt things which again sort of produce a Cambrian explosion of potential possibilities that has a kind of hype and energy cycle into it.
2853880	2864880	But, you know, I was in touch with some of the people that were founding the Mid Journey project, and there were artists very close to the beginning of that project.
2864880	2871880	So David, the founder, had a group of people who were very art adjacent around him as he was doing the first iterations of that engine.
2871880	2887880	And, you know, I designed an NFT project with one of the founders of CryptoKitties called DotCom Seance, which used very early algorithms that weren't Mid Journey but were kind of adjacent to that before Mid Journey existed with the same community of people.
2887880	2895880	And I know other artists like John Raffman also were there trying out things at the same time, so this is again the same kind of community of people that I've been talking about for the longer time.
2895880	2911880	But then when that becomes a kind of hit product, I think, you know, immediately voices like ours became less interesting to David than other people around him designing business models which were more, you know, about value capture and scale.
2911880	2921880	So I think at the moment, there are AI and ownership adjacent conversations which I think are really interesting that are happening from this community.
2921880	2939880	I'm thinking explicitly of Matt Dryhurst and Holly Herndon's project Spawning that they're building, which is about ownership and training sets and trying to define more explicit spaces for artists ownership and royalties associated with being a part of various training sets.
2939880	2940880	I think that's really interesting.
2940880	2951880	I mean, again, I don't know if I would put that on a left right spectrum, but I think it's about the small actor having agency and centralized systems.
2951880	2954880	So I think that could be could be could be left Jason.
2954880	2958880	And so that's where I think that's happening.
2958880	2968880	But I think also AI is a harder thing to become a part of than crypto was for a small actor because because of the centralized nature of the of the technology.
2968880	2977880	So you can build on top of centralized systems, but it's not the same thing as starting your own protocol or becoming part of a core group of Ethereum devs.
2977880	2993880	You know, these things were just more open culturally and and and and actively, you know, and I was very lucky to be around a Berlin and around a cultural balloon that was adjacent to the flowering of Ethereum's possibilities at the times.
2993880	2996880	And it was whatever you think of the Ethereum project now.
2996880	3007880	And and and there is a real spectrum of political possibilities, I think, in the Ethereum community, some which are very right libertarian and some which are much more left adjacent.
3007880	3009880	But at least those spaces are open.
3009880	3010880	You can walk into those rooms.
3010880	3016880	You can, you know, if you're if you're if you're in those circles, they're approachable and and somewhat understandable.
3016880	3021880	And I think, yeah, for me, the adjacency to AI is so much more distant.
3023880	3040880	I mean, what always struck me with the crypto sphere and the imaginaries that are that were coming out of that and even the imaginaries that were developed in a more like left leaning spectrum, which I guess is one that you're also engaging with.
3040880	3056880	I mean, there's a certain type of pre-configuration going on, which is that the way in which these imaginaries are built is always on top of a layer that is kind of strictly transactional.
3057880	3062880	You know, so the because that's kind of built in to these infrastructures.
3062880	3075880	It's it's at the end, the tools that they try to employ for building, I don't know, a left utopian dowel or whatever, you know, the tools are framed within a framework that is strictly transactional.
3075880	3095880	And that at the end kind of has a certain tool set, which is in most of the time can be and I'm being polemic here, but can be kind of boiled down to monetary incentive structures that that they try to employ in order to get people to do whatever.
3095880	3104880	And that's a certain type of way of relating to things, to people, to more than human nature, to whatever, you know.
3104880	3114880	And if you limit yourself in such a fashion, then this is already a very, very, very narrow corridor within which you think about these alternatives.
3114880	3123880	And this is this was really very irritating to me, I have to say, when when interacting with these types of projects.
3123880	3136880	And and but then within this narrow corridor, of course, the people are very enthusiastic, very also kind of honestly trying to do things differently.
3136880	3141880	But I'm looking at it and I'm thinking, yeah, it's already flawed.
3141880	3147880	I could imagine a lot of the actors that I was in contact with during this period could relate very well to that analysis.
3147880	3156880	So I think that it's a it's a it's a wall that a number of people I know found themselves up against and found to be limiting.
3156880	3169880	Yeah, but then but then if we stick to this small description of recent history and we had, you know, this explorationist energy kind of going into parts of the crypto sphere.
3169880	3180880	And now we get to this point where we have this critique where with this obviously is a corridor that is framed way too narrowly.
3180880	3183880	Then what's where do we go from here?
3183880	3190880	You know, and then and you also pointed out that the AI thing is kind of too difficult to get into.
3190880	3194880	But it doesn't mean that it's not only right now.
3194880	3200880	Yeah, yeah, no. But but the question would be where you know that there must be other roads to go as well.
3200880	3209880	You know, that's not it's not just AI or, you know, the dead end of incentivation through through crypto tokens or whatever.
3209880	3219880	You know, there are other ways as well. Do you have any feeling or any are there any sparks that you can see that point towards different directions?
3220880	3241880	I mean, my, you know, my flannery, or if that's a that's a word, you know, position that that I have right has always been trying to come to things where I see emerging possibilities happening and sort of figuring out what's going on culturally and
3241880	3246880	trying to reify that into something that makes sense and within my idiom.
3246880	3252880	And and I've seen a few hype cycles come and go.
3252880	3258880	Right. And I think we certainly are at a low point in the crypto hype cycle where very few possibilities are seen.
3258880	3268880	Some some very few possibilities are seen because of what you said that the design space is so specifically interest that there is no alternative possible to build on those foundations.
3268880	3275880	That would be one bottoming out of a hype cycle. Hope world for certain actors.
3275880	3283880	Right. And I think that often when you reach a trough like that, it's quiet for a few months.
3283880	3292880	And then there's another moment where suddenly somebody sees something in that design space that can alter that that can be something different.
3292880	3302880	And I'm never the person that or my role is not to spawn these moments or to to start them.
3302880	3307880	But it's more to be listening close enough to to notice them as they emerge.
3307880	3313880	Right now, I'm not sure where that's going to come from. But but we're not at the end of history yet.
3313880	3316880	And and I'm sure there will be moments of possibility.
3316880	3321880	And I think often in the past, these spaces have opened up in very surprising ways.
3321880	3328880	You know, so again, like, I don't think anybody making art on blockchains saw NFTs coming as a paradigm shift.
3328880	3334880	Nobody, you know, and there were many people frustratedly trying to find a way to connect.
3334880	3338880	I mean, this is a very narrow design space. Again, it's not the same political macro you're talking about.
3338880	3346880	But in terms of like hype cycles and possibility horizons in imaginaries, I think often it can seem like there's nothing.
3346880	3349880	And then all of a sudden, there's something that changes that perspective.
3349880	3354880	And it's very, very hard to see coming down the road until you're sort of on it.
3354880	3358880	And I'm not on it right now. And I don't know where it's coming down the road.
3358880	3365880	But I imagine there will be a turn which makes a design space and an imaginary space possible, you know, if that gives you an answer.
3365880	3372880	Yeah, yeah. And I just wanted to point out that at least to me, it doesn't seem surprising that NFT came along, I have to say.
3372880	3378880	I mean, not that I could have foreseen it, but it's very coherent, I would say, because I mean, it...
3378880	3383880	Yeah, but everything's coherent in retrospect, right? That's the thing about history.
3383880	3387880	Yeah, well, I mean, that's true. But I mean, it's coherent in the way that...
3388880	3398880	I mean, what blockchains always did was to formalize ownership without formalizing identity.
3398880	3410880	And so there was always a form of kind of focusing on there was a strong emphasis on ownership.
3410880	3433880	And so the idea that this space at some point will bring about kind of the quote unquote ultimate idea of hyper speculative ownership asset is kind of that's why I mean, it's coherent.
3433880	3436880	Makes sense. No, I understand what you're saying.
3436880	3451880	But I mean, I think I also the other part of the answer maybe to your question of like, you know, is there going to be a design space that's possible that's anything to do with crypto or AI that the people who want to build things on the left can engage with in earnest without being defeated before the purpose?
3451880	3455880	I mean, I wonder if that question is so specific to technology, right?
3456880	3458880	Yeah, no, no, no, it's not. Of course. Yeah.
3458880	3469880	Right. But this is what maybe is maybe important from my macro cultural perspective to understand it's maybe not a technical question.
3469880	3495880	That's maybe a question that is broader, because I also don't see anything outside of crypto as a design space, which also doesn't rely on the underpinnings of, of, you know, basically monetarist understanding of, of how power works and how people align and what you know what getting communities
3495880	3511880	together means and what the levers are to, to nudge those is, you know, so it's, yeah, as I say, I think it's not really a technological question, but it's a cultural question that the technology projects that are built and, and built on reflect as well, right?
3511880	3531880	If the technology is a, is a, is a relic of a political environment, again, without being determinist of which comes first, it's unsurprising that the technological stack is in synergy with a general narrative around what possibilities are for design in general, right?
3531880	3549880	Yeah, right, right. And I just want to state clearly that I, of course, also do not think that it's a technological project first, of course, it's a, it's a political project, but I'm specifically interested in this nexus, you know, and I think you are too, somehow, you know, and then, so this is then
3550880	3578880	Maybe we can revisit earlier moments in our conversation, right? We're like, you know, we see where are actors looking for spaces of possibility that have a lot of information available to them, right? And, and again, on the conservative side of things, politically, I see actors investing a lot in, in offline small communities of cultural actors, doing, you know, seeding ideas in a very organic bottom
3578880	3599880	up way. And that is, of course, a social technology, one could frame it like that. So maybe that's a space of possibility for people of different politics as well to invest in, you know, ground level, authentic, small communities of people who have energy and a little bit of glamour around
3599880	3624880	them. Maybe those are technological spaces for invention. You don't have to use the word crypto to describe those, you don't have to use mention AI to describe those spaces. Those are very human cultural technologies. And I think, yeah, if that's a possibility space that is worthy enough for very busy people with a lot of resources to invest their time and energies in
3624880	3654880	cultivating explicitly, then perhaps we can do that in cheaper ways ourselves that don't need that capital, especially if we are the actors indeed producing that value, supposedly, right? So that's where I see the possibility for people that I teach in art that I, you know, I have a mentoring program that I also co founded with a bunch of artists outside of my academic teaching and in the German art school system, called Berlin Program for Artists, which helps artists who are already starting out their journeys into being kind of professional actors.
3654880	3671880	Outside of institutions like schools, and gives them a community to work with. I think that's a very worthwhile, you know, deployment of my personal efforts and capital, the limited amount that I have, you know. So I think, yeah, maybe that's an answer in terms of where possibility is.
3671880	3695880	I mean, I have one question here where you quite surely will have to have a disclaimer again. I'm not sure if I should, but I'll just ask it and we'll see where it takes us. I mean, because there's a certain dead end, so to speak, that I encounter oftentimes in future histories when talking to
3695880	3719520	different people about, yeah, also questions of democratic planning and the like. And since the artwork allows itself a bit more of, I would say, speculative slack, maybe, I thought maybe you encountered interesting approaches around this question. So the dead end comes in when, as I said, thinking about democratic planning.
3719520	3749160	But in relation to a, I would say, relational materialist thinking, meaning that you do want to establish structures of democratic planning, but without falling back into essentialist notions of truth, essentialist notions of the individual, the human individual, the human subject, but instead work towards an expanded notion of what the, what this democratic polis might be, you know, expanding it to include non-human actors.
3749520	3769160	The more than human in general, more than human nature, but also, of course, possibly technological environments and stuff like that. So maybe one could speak of a government of things where things are not thought of only as objects, but from a perspective of relational materialism.
3770000	3796880	So, but this then kind of brings up the question how to, again, maybe design the polis, how to design this space beyond relying on human subjects as its nucleus, you know? So a non, more than human government of things as democracy. What would that look like?
3796880	3806440	And I've asked many different people and I didn't get very far yet. I have some clues, some leads, but I would be interested. What do you think about it?
3807280	3832240	Well, yeah, I'm definitely going to just claim at this run. So again, my role is to synthesize things that I have a reasonable sense of adjacency to and a reasonable sense that I can speak to them meaningfully and, you know, add value in my reification towards at least of capturing an essence of something that I feel able to capture.
3833240	3856240	And this is also where I would come to this question from is that I think a lot of people, maybe like yourself, look for political imaginaries and technological spaces for designing community that outside of what the dominant political fantasies and actualities are.
3856800	3876520	And certainly in the art world and in the cultural space, often, then there's a question of who is designing those spaces and who is in charge of making those decisions. And yeah, you point out, you know, human and non-human actors.
3876520	3904520	There are whole understandings of the world that are old, that include ways of understanding these things that are coming from the culture that is not the people in California that we've been talking about, nor the political theorists that we've been referring to during this conversation, that often come from communities that have been disempowered by these things.
3907520	3929520	Exactly that trajectory of actors, right? So again, I'm going to come back to my upbringing and my geographical understanding of the world, which was from New Zealand. And, you know, Maori and Pacific indigenous communities have been have ways of understanding the world and actors within it.
3930520	3952520	Across human and non-human spaces and, indeed, explicit political and technological paradigms for, you know, working and ordering the world and being an actor in it that works very well for a long time.
3952520	3981520	Prior to the cultural spaces that we occupy, and we are part of antagonizing, right? And I think certainly in the art world, a lot of attention and reallocation of resources is going towards recognizing and trying to grapple with how to include those types of understandings of the world more productively in the way that we see them.
3982520	3986520	In the type of cultural design space that we're occupying and coming from.
3988520	3993520	That's a very carefully worded answer because it's a very tricky space.
3994520	4004520	And I've made my own attempts to come into dialogue with people that know more than me about those ways of understanding technology and understanding the world.
4004520	4026520	I did a big project in New Zealand with a thinker architect that I really admire called Karamia Muller, who comes from a Samoan background, not only, but, you know, her world of expertise is indigenous space, indigenous understandings of space from a Pacific perspective.
4026520	4038520	And we made an exhibition together, a group exhibition together of objects that came both from a crypto design space and a kind of an understanding of a lineage of design from crypto histories.
4038520	4046520	Interestingly, her uncle is Swiss as well as Samoan.
4046520	4048520	There's an interesting colonial history there.
4048520	4060520	And he is also the founder of a very important set of banking infrastructure that was adjacent to the birth of crypto in Switzerland and its interaction with the world mainstream finance.
4060520	4070520	So he was the legal actor that designed the possibilities for the launch of Ethereum in dialogue with Vitalik.
4070520	4076520	And he founded a very important crypto bank called Signum, which a lot of crypto projects use.
4076520	4102520	And, you know, it was really interesting to antagonize that history and put it alongside other Pacific histories and other Pacific adjacent actors thinking about community and design and what agency was in terms of technology, what technology indeed mean, who was able to claim the technological, who was able to design political space, and what power structures meant in that.
4102520	4122520	So this is maybe a more detailed answer than you want, but I do think that those are where people in my community find energy to have conversations that look different from monetary incentive design.
4122520	4125520	But it comes with difficult cultural territory.
4125520	4138520	It comes with an admission and a reckoning with oneself that if you're in that design space, as a white guy like me, you might not be leading that design space, right?
4138520	4147520	You can't just simply appropriate those structures of design and work on top of them as your own.
4147520	4157520	And that involves a different understanding of agency and collaboration than I was certainly used to before I tried to engage in those kinds of conversations.
4157520	4167520	And it leads to conversations that sound very different to the one that you and I have had today with also different pace and a different understanding of where value lies, etc.
4167520	4187520	So I guess maybe my takeaway from that experience and continuing to think in this space is that maybe even the way that you and I are describing design as a part of the problematics that we're encountering that are cultural, technological, political, right?
4187520	4197520	So we might have to de-center ourselves if we want to make space for things that are other than that.
4197520	4219520	Absolutely. And I mean, the way that I kind of asked for how to bring about socio-technical imaginaries can easily be understood as if I was thinking that this would be as easy and as if this would be desirable in such a quasi top-down fashion, which of course I'm not.
4219520	4222520	But I totally understand that.
4222520	4225520	Yeah, the colonial and all of these things come back, right?
4225520	4245520	And I think part of where my research also sits and often encounters is that the way that language and narrative is crafted from California has a long history, has a lot of continuity with things that seem often when new products are proposed to be very far away.
4246520	4267520	But yeah, I mean, you don't have to look very far once you reframe the lens into the language of frontiers, hero stories of saviors coming and designing things that enable everybody else to be subjects, etc.
4267520	4272520	These things are deep, cool stories that we tell and retell and package and repackage.
4272520	4285520	And there I think we can meaningfully use the word we, because I think it is people like you and me that are that infrastructure in our bodies and our minds.
4285520	4287520	Absolutely.
4287520	4303520	This all kind of really nicely relates to the last episode of Future History is actually where I had Elisa Long Cone Antilleo as a guest, who is a Mapuche leader and was involved in the constitutional process of recently in Chile.
4303520	4317520	Maybe, I mean, we are having this conversation as part of the, let's say, extended exhibition program of your show Metaverse Landscapes at the Kunstverein Hannover.
4317520	4320520	So maybe let's have a little promo block at least.
4320520	4325520	What are you investigating with this specific work of yours, the Metaverse Landscapes?
4325520	4331520	Yeah, I mean, it doesn't need to be a promo block actually, because it flows on very well from the conversation we're having.
4332520	4353520	My work, again, my role as an artist is I think to kind of try and take these feelings and observations that I have and dialogue with my various different conversations that I have and kind of make it into compelling objects that make sense within the context which I deploy them in the history of art and contemporary art making.
4353520	4366520	And so I've made a series of paintings, which is a format that art has, that has been at the center of a certain type of art for a very long time, and modernism obviously is one of those.
4366520	4374520	And, and also landscape painting has been something that I've been thinking about a lot in relation to exactly these questions, right.
4374520	4395520	So, growing up in New Zealand, the first thing that I learned in art history class was about settler landscapes of New Zealand from European painters, and those European painters took the aesthetic language of Europe, and sort of like, you know, exported it, dragged and dropped it on top of,
4395520	4421520	quote unquote, new spaces and lands, and they produced these images that were reproduced throughout the settler communities that were looking towards New Zealand, and that formed imaginaries in the minds of those settlers who would move there and start buying and selling land as, you know, as broken up pieces of property,
4421520	4432520	and also just simply occupy those spaces and cultivate them in cultural and technological ways that Europe had been before, right.
4432520	4448520	So, so I saw the role of the artists, which were often commissioned by, you know, private companies that did the early work of the colonial establishment that also had, by the way, you know, financial structures, which are very important to the history of modernism within them,
4448520	4472520	joint stock companies, etc., you know, were part of colonial projects and, you know, absorbed into sovereign states after they'd kind of created these products out of the colonies they were producing, and artists produced these imageries which sort of captured some of the imaginaries of what those spaces were becoming, what they might become, and kind of political and financial possibilities of those lands.
4472520	4490520	And I thought, hmm, that happening at the same time as I was looking at crypto assets a lot, thinking about the emergence of, you know, being able to own parts of the internet, maybe one could say that there's a sort of similar parceling up of what has been a commons into a space that you can now own and trade.
4490520	4508520	And certainly that was made very explicit in metaverses where you could buy and sell properties in various different metaverses which were scarce and ways of pictorially imagining what those spaces might look like and what might be possible in them, which also drew on histories of image making.
4508520	4533520	So if you buy a property in a prominent Ethereum adjacent metaverse like Decentraland, you buy a gridded image with a red dot in the middle of a sort of a part of a top down map, which looks like a grid to those who are trained in understanding modernist painting history.
4534520	4543520	The grid on a square is a very important trope and was also adjacent to processing rationalized town planning.
4543520	4557520	I'm thinking about painters like Piet Mondrian and very well known paintings like Broadway Boogie Woogie, which were of the kind of Manhattan grid or derived from the Manhattan grid and then went out into abstraction.
4557520	4567520	And I was thinking, huh, maybe there's a similar role that I can play as a neo-colonial painter of these spaces that are being packaged and settled.
4568520	4593520	So I've made modernist-esque paintings of existing properties in various metaverses, including Decentraland, which look at once like mid-century abstract grid painting and are indeed pictures of landscape properties that are being speculated on in this kind of neo-colonial environment that we're kind of experiencing with the growth of metaverses.
4593520	4605520	And maybe the inevitability of capitalism moving on into virtual spaces as we reach the limits to what is possible in the kind of physical world, let's say.
4605520	4621520	And so with those paintings of other people's properties that I've put in this exhibition, I also issued a new token that comes with each painting, which tracks the owner of that property that your painting depicts.
4621520	4629520	So when you look at the painting that you see on the wall of the museum, or indeed if you own one at home, you're looking at a depiction of somebody else's property.
4629520	4638520	And you can always scan the side of the painting where I've put a little QR code in to see who the owner of that property is at any given time.
4638520	4647520	And also to see where the development of that property is going, because these metaverses change interfaces, they grow, they subdivide in different ways.
4647520	4656520	Different actors do different things with various plots, and often those are reflected on the token itself that is the kind of proof of ownership of that property.
4656520	4668520	So you can kind of have your painting of a certain moment in the early development of these early settled lands, and then you can also see where the kind of current development is at in these moments.
4668520	4678520	So yeah, this is also about, I guess, exploring the continuities of these technological paradigms as they emerge.
4678520	4687520	Fantastic. Simon, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests, and it is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
4687520	4702520	Ah, that's a great question. So I'm always thinking about the future, and especially in the role of being in touch with artists who are always trying to make new things and think about things in different ways.
4702520	4723520	So what makes me joyful about the future is those special moments that I'm going to have learning about these artists' projects and how they reframe and package the world in moving ways, which help me understand and relate to what's going on, both in technology, politics and culture.
4723520	4727520	Wonderful. Simon, thank you so much for being part of Future Histories.
4727520	4734520	Thank you very much, Jan. It's been a real pleasure, and you're a fantastic conversation partner. It's really productive for me. Thank you.
4734520	4735520	Thank you so much.
4757520	4761520	I might like it as well. Thanks a lot and hear you in two weeks.
