0	7840	Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome Lea Ippie in today's show.
7840	12960	She is professor of political theory at the London School of Economics
12960	18480	and author of the brilliant book Free Coming of Age at the End of History.
18480	24160	Before we start, I would like to thank Wilfried and Fabian for their kind donations
24160	29760	and I would like to welcome Bj√∂rn, Manuel and Gerion as patrons of Future Histories.
30320	35520	Thank you so much and now please enjoy today's episode with Lea Ippie.
41280	47120	Welcome Lea. Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure. Just to give the audience some
47120	52880	orientation, could you give us a rough sketch of the quite unique position of socialist Albania
52880	57120	and the conflict between East and West in the time when you were growing up?
58080	64480	Yeah, so I grew up. I was born in 1979 and was growing up in Albania in the 80s
64480	71360	and lived through the transition from being communist system to a liberal system in 1990.
73120	78320	In the time in which I was growing up, Albania was a country with a socialist constitution
78320	82880	which had fallen out with every other socialist country or at least every other socialist
82880	91120	superpower in the world. It was also a very isolated country economically and militarily,
91120	98880	politically on all fronts and the perception and the rhetoric of its own self-understanding
98880	104160	that came through the history books and the classes and school when I was growing up was of
104160	110240	it being this unique country that was engaged, a very small country which was engaged in a dual
110240	116080	fight against both Western imperialism, so Anglo-Americans on the one hand, but also
116080	121280	Soviet and Chinese imperialism on the other. And it hadn't been like that throughout its history,
121280	127440	so Albania became socialist in 1946 at the end of the Second World War and it had a brief period
127440	131920	of alliance with Yugoslavia with which it fell out mainly for issues to do with territorial
131920	138720	integrity and what would happen to Albania and the reluctance of part of the Albanian socialist
138720	146080	leadership to be part of Yugoslavia as a socialist republic as some other projects went and for that
146080	149840	reason kind of allied with the Soviet Union but broke with the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union
150560	155920	destalinized and criticized the cult of Stalin and Albania had this perception of itself as being the
155920	163600	only rigorous, coherent, pure communist country in the world which somehow also in its self-understanding
163600	168880	entailed maintaining the cult of Stalin and then there was this brief period of alliance with China
168880	173280	and then eventually also broke with China when the Chinese became too moderate so basically when I
173280	178960	was growing up it was completely on its own and the understanding was that it was on its own
178960	182720	and the rhetoric was it was on its own and so this is how I grew up with this idea that
183200	188640	it was a small country that stood up to all these great superpowers for the sake of a freedom that
188640	194640	it defended and that we all as citizens of that state had a duty to defend as well.
196000	201280	And what I particularly liked about the book was the way in which you approach the task of opening
201280	208160	up our collective sense of political imagination because you do so in a I would say multi-directional
208160	213520	manner you do it by reflecting upon the past in order to learn from concrete experiences in
213520	220160	this case the experiences of communist Albania and its transition to liberal democracy and by
220160	225520	looking at these concrete experiences you at the same time open up a space of possibility for both
226080	231920	critical reflection about the present as well as the imagination of alternative futures I would say
231920	235600	would you say this is an accurate description of the book's movement?
236560	243680	Yeah I think the book is very much a book that is not prescriptive in any way and so to the extent
243680	248800	that it has anything prescriptive in terms of how it should be understood it really is about opening
248800	254960	up reflection spaces and then letting readers draw their own conclusions I'd say the overarching theme
254960	260480	of the book is freedom and what it means to be free and with that connected with that the theme
260480	266080	of autonomy and to kind of make decisions that you're responsible for even though you live in
266080	270720	circumstances and conditions in which you don't actually make all the world according to the way
270720	274320	which you'd wanted to make so you're kind of thrown into a world that you don't control
274320	279360	but somehow have to make these decisions that you do have to take ownership of and own the
279360	286880	consequences of and the book really does that by reflecting both at a personal level in terms of
286880	292080	it's a coming-of-age story and so it's about an individual who discovers what freedom may or may
292080	298560	not be and both the kind of the promises and the disillusionments of freedom and about a country
298560	304240	that goes through a similar process of seeing freedom sometimes promised and sometimes betrayed
304240	310960	and sometimes coming as a dream sometimes coming as a tragedy and all of these things I think
310960	317920	enable the book to operate at different levels as you say of criticism both of various theories
317920	324320	approaches and so abstract conceptions of you know how the world should be run and to try and
324320	329760	think about that in context and also more importantly in how they affect individuals and
329760	334400	how they make a difference to the lives of people but also then to reflect on the difficulties that
334400	338080	these raise at the individual level in terms of their own personal people's personal choices
338080	344320	and how they try to navigate these transitions and changes in the system and so on so I would
344320	349040	say that because it's a book on freedom and because it's not really an abstract book on
349040	354240	freedom even though there are many abstract themes that permeate all its chapters it's a book that
354240	359840	really tries to leave the reader as free as possible in interpreting it and thinking about
359840	363920	you know what does it mean where is it going what's the author trying to say and so on and so
364880	369200	obviously I have it has a political message I have my own political messages and so on but I
369200	374560	try not to say a lot more than the book already says about all these things and to just let people
374560	379520	draw their own conclusions from it so it's a very open book in that sense and more as I say more a
379520	385360	book of reflection and opening up spaces for reflection than on anything more concrete and
385360	393200	more directed and more specific even though the book itself doesn't prescribe any interpretation
393440	399680	and this is absolutely great I would be interested in your opinions anyway I guess and in the like
399680	406560	abstract ideas and your positioning towards them as well and there's one passage in the book where
406560	413120	you kind of dissect the new political language that is coming along with a system change and
413120	420240	there are different words that that are new to you as a child or as a teenager and to the public in
420240	427440	Albania in total I would say the words like civil society for example and there's a list that you
427440	433200	have of words that got swapped for others and I'd like to quote some of them because you say that
433200	439280	civil society joined other keywords such as liberalization which replaced democratic
439280	444960	centralism privatization which replaced collectivization transparency which replaced
444960	451040	self-criticism transition which stayed the same but now indicated the transition from socialism to
451040	457680	liberalism instead of the transition from socialism to communism and fighting corruption which replaced
457680	463840	anti-imperialist struggle end quote and then you state that all of these new terms that came up
463840	470400	with this system change were connected to a word that both political systems used heavily and that's
470480	476000	freedom as you already stated only now it was about the freedom of individual and not the
476000	481600	collective so maybe we could talk a bit about these different conceptions of freedom you
481600	487280	reflect upon in the book and how they are reflected within the different systems that you experienced
487280	494640	and then maybe which ideas of freedom are still unrealized and unreflected in both of these systems
495280	501680	yeah great so that's the in that is the big question of the book in a way it's it's the
501680	505760	book is a reflection of these ideas different ideas of freedom and how they're central to
505760	511920	these different systems and also in some ways in the book to central to also the life orientation
511920	517360	of the particular characters of the book and I guess the two main ones that try I try to talk
517360	522000	about as a political theorist is the ones that have in the intellectual tradition and
522000	525600	history of political thought being thought of as alternatives to each other so on the one hand
525600	530800	this idea of negative freedom and then the idea of positive freedom and I'll say a little bit more
530800	535680	about each of them if I may and then I'll say what I think about both of them and where that
535680	541680	what I think comes through in the book so there is this character in the book which is my mother
542240	549840	who is a kind of arch libertarian and who is a proto or not proto-post Thatcherite figure
549920	557840	or a contemporary of Thatcher at least she's sort of modeling herself on Thatcher in her hostility
557840	563120	to socialism in her belief in individual responsibility in her belief in unlimited
563120	569760	personal freedom which also entails the freedom to make mistakes and to let these uncoordinated
569760	574240	structures of cooperation between individuals fail when they need to in the way in which
574240	580960	sometimes it's described by Hayek or these kind of authors connected to that way of thinking and
580960	585840	with this great resistance to the concept of the state and of bureaucracy and of administration as
585840	592240	all abstract obstacles to the realization of this perfect individual freedom and that's in
592240	597040	her conception this freedom is close to what has often been called negative freedom because it's
597040	603600	the freedom from and so you are free to the extent that nobody tells you where to go what to do how
603600	611040	to dress and in that in those freedoms being absent is consists the lack of freedom of a society
611040	617840	and of course Albania in that sense or communist society of that kind and of the kind I grew up in
617840	623440	was a paradigmatic example of the violation of these freedoms because you couldn't think freely
623440	628000	you could you weren't allowed to express your opinions in writing you weren't allowed to protest
628000	632160	you would actually be harshly punished if you try to leave the country and so there is a number of
632160	637680	domains of personal life in which individuals could not be free and so my mother thought that
637680	642560	and this this conception of freedom that she stands for in some way this negative conception
642560	650640	of freedom is represented by this violation that Albanian communism exemplified in its most severe
650640	657120	most extreme form and is gained after in the transition after 1990 because it is exactly
657120	664560	what comes it's the ability to vote freely in elections to have uncontrolled uncensored
664560	672240	political opinions to also travel outside the country and so on and that's some of these things
672240	676640	are the kinds of things that I put pressure on this conception of freedom when I say that the
676640	683680	freedom from or for example the freedom from obstacles to traveling isn't that robust and
683680	690160	isn't that meaningful if you don't actually have options too and so this takes us to a different
690160	695840	slightly not antagonistic but complementary I would say account of freedom which is the one
695840	701360	that my father exemplifies in the book so he is this character who is some people define him as
701360	707200	a kind of classical lefty or social democrat but more kind of radical kind or someone with left
707200	712400	leanings who is very concerned by opportunities opportunities to flourish opportunities to be who
712400	718640	you are and to realize yourself and who realizes also that this negative conception of freedom is
718640	725200	not enough to guarantee that but you know freedom is also freedom too it's not just freedom from
725200	731600	it's not just a freedom from an agent interfering with your personal choices it's also freedom to
731600	736720	find opportunities in a social structure that is hospitable to your choices and to your autonomy
737280	741840	and he's interesting because he has this alternative conception of freedom
742720	746800	sometimes in the liberal literature in the kind of classical liberal literature so if
746800	752960	you think for example of Isaiah Berlin's account of freedom and his criticisms of negative or
752960	759360	positive freedom often the idea of positive freedom is represented as the idea of having
759360	763440	an authority that actually guarantees these conditions for freedom and so it's often presented
763440	767520	as what you want you either you can either have negative freedom or if you want positive freedom
767520	771680	the positive freedom leads you to a kind of totalitarian abuse because if it gives to a
771680	777280	collective responsibility for the realization of the individual that are somewhat dangerous
777280	783200	but in some ways you also see that that positive freedom is actually what is missing in post
783200	788480	communist Albania in the 90s is precisely this idea that you are formally free allegedly free
788480	794240	in fact you have negative freedom but what you don't have is often positive freedom in terms of
794240	798880	the environment in which you live the society in which you live making accommodations to your
798880	803280	ability to realize yourself and so there's two examples in the book one is the freedom of
803280	808080	movement one which I talk about this idea that you can be free to leave your country nobody shoots
808080	812800	you anymore at the border but then you're trying to get into the west and the borders are closed
812800	817920	and so where do you go does that mean that you really have freedom of movement or not if you
818560	824480	don't have the freedom to be somewhere as opposed to just the freedom from leaving somewhere and in
824480	830480	another dimension it comes out because my father despite him being a lefty and being very concerned
830480	835200	by this conception by this idea of a society that is accommodating for everyone and so on
835760	842000	is at one point in a position of responsibility and needs to make decisions for firing workers
842000	847040	as a result of the structural reforms that were brought about with the help of international
847040	853040	institutions like the world bank and the imf and so on and to implement what was called the
853040	858800	shock therapy that was a way in which people talked about how the societies of eastern
858800	865360	europe had to be brought up to being up to scratch with the standards of free market societies both
865360	871280	political and economic and this would entail shutting down state enterprises privatizing
871280	877440	wealth and increasing the ability of individuals to take free economic initiatives which brought
877440	881600	a huge cost which in some case also entailed a raise of unemployment for example and my father was
882960	888400	responsible for firing people on behalf of those who were supporting these structural reforms
888400	892640	which he found very difficult because to connect it to this conception of freedom
892640	898640	it's very hard to think that you have a positive freedom if you are not able to flourish in society
898640	903760	and you can't flourish if you don't have a job basically so this is the the second idea and so
903760	908320	there's a sense in which one might simplify it by saying you can have a society in which
908320	914800	you are guaranteed from unemployment but you don't have freedom of speech and another society is you
914800	919920	have freedom of speech but no guarantees from unemployment and these are deficient models of
919920	926480	freedom but from different reasons and on different conceptions of freedom so that's the the kind of
926480	933200	crude simplified picture of these two alternatives that I present and then there's still room for
933200	937760	something else isn't it you paint a picture of these alternatives and these are of course kind
937760	948240	of prototypes of conceptions of freedom but both of these alone miss something for sure and we
948240	955600	should develop some alternative which kind of brings in additional notions of what freedom
955600	962080	could actually be like so what is it that is still unresolved when you simply just
962720	968560	take these two examples as if this was the whole thing that is actually possible
970000	976480	yeah so the one that I describe in the book and that I'm interested in exploring is something
976480	983280	that comes through my grandmother's character and the idea that she basically for both from
983280	988400	my mother and from my father they lived in they live in unfree societies both of them are unfree
988400	993200	for different reasons but you know they fail to realize the promises that they make and what's
993200	997680	interesting about my grandmother is that she has someone who has lived through different transitions
997680	1006000	different political systems different political communities she's born in this ottoman town
1006000	1011280	salonica shortly before it became shortly before the ottoman empire collapsed for good and so her
1011280	1017440	identity is one of a political unit unit that doesn't exist anymore and she and then she came
1017440	1025280	to albania and was the wife of was first integrated in the albanian elite and was relatively progressive
1025280	1030320	but then her husband went to prison and so she was deported and had ended up in working in labor
1030320	1035360	camps and had this very difficult life under communism and what always stood out about her
1035360	1040480	was the fact that whenever you asked her to you know to talk about her life she never stressed
1040480	1045760	the oppression she always is stressed stressed agency the fact that even in all these circumstances
1045760	1050800	she was able to find her direction and to take responsibility for the things that she had done
1051600	1057760	and she brought me up this kind of inculcating me with this idea that even in the most oppressive
1057760	1062400	circumstances there is something that no nobody can take away from you which is free which is
1062400	1068080	human dignity and in that human dignity consists freedom and so and this is why partly i became
1068080	1074720	later interested in exploring this idea but for me freedom is something that is revealed in moral
1074720	1081760	agency in your ability to make choices between the good and the bad and to resist compromises
1081760	1086800	that bring huge costs to other people and i would say that's a more critical conception of freedom
1086800	1091920	that's neither positive nor negative freedom but it's exactly as i call it when i talk about the
1091920	1097360	book and when i talk about my favorite conception of freedom is freedom as moral agency and that
1097360	1104480	means that this freedom of moral agency which is revealed in the agent's capacity to see that they
1104480	1109440	have this inner freedom but they live in a world that doesn't realize these moral relations that
1109440	1113200	doesn't in a world that doesn't dignify people where you have this internal dignity but the
1113200	1118320	dignity is not recognized in the social relations between people that's a more abstract way of
1118320	1122560	talking about unfreedom than to just say it's not having the freedom to work or it's not having the
1122560	1128160	freedom to talk or whatever it's basically about what kind of social relations what kind of
1128160	1133280	political world you want to live in and is it possible for that world to realize this morality
1133280	1137440	this kind of core morality that we find in the individual and that is never actually taken away
1137440	1141840	from and so this is slightly different because in one way you're free always because you're
1141840	1147120	always a moral agent and you always have the capacity to discern the good from the bad but in
1147120	1152320	another way you're also not free when you don't live in a world in which that is instantiated
1152320	1158800	at the level of social relations and so this conception of freedom as moral agency i think
1158800	1166240	gives you a kind of critical benchmark from which you can observe and assess the circumstances of
1166240	1172000	the societies in which you live and you can also make decisions about how critical to be of those
1172000	1176960	societies and how to examine the politics of those societies and to see whether they're actually
1176960	1185600	realizing freedom or not very interesting i mean this moral agency this can hardly be
1185600	1193840	independent of the socio-political structures that forms them that kind of set the scene for
1194880	1200480	the individual to act within so how do you define this relation between the
1200480	1207680	the like superstructure so to speak and the individual that should rely on this kind of
1207680	1214880	moral agency because i mean this is highly entangled isn't it yeah so i think the the
1214880	1220400	moral agency is what enables you to be critical of the structures in which you live and so it's
1220400	1225440	what enables you to ask yourself the question of do i live in a political environment or in an
1225520	1231520	economic environment or in a social environment in which dignity is realized and to me that entails
1231520	1238080	a range of criticisms about the absence of those freedoms in a lot of domains that we are surrounded
1238080	1243440	by and so and as an ideal of a kind of society that you want to live in i think it takes you
1243440	1250320	to a fully egalitarian democratic society in which democracy is central to realizing freedom
1250320	1257840	in moral relations amongst all people and the reason that takes you to a critique of both the
1257840	1262880	economic and the political order and social order in which we live is that we live in an order in
1262880	1267760	which that is actually shaped by asymmetries of power of all kinds and that can be economic
1267760	1273120	power it can be social power it can be political power it can be about the power of bigger states
1273120	1278480	towards smaller states in the international sphere it can be about the power of employers
1278480	1284480	that have money versus vulnerable citizens that don't have money in the labor market it can be
1284480	1291440	about social relations and hierarchies of race or language or identity that kind of permeate these
1291440	1297600	historical self-understandings of people and so i think none of it is defined but what it what
1297600	1303360	what you get from this conception is a way of criticizing what the environment in which you
1303360	1308080	live in and that can give you the kind of critical standard with which to then try and
1308640	1313680	move forward from the critique and and then to kind of collaborate with others as well and to
1313680	1319520	work with others to to try and construct something that is better that's very interesting because
1319520	1327760	this is again highly tied to the biographical the image that you paint of yourself as a child and
1327760	1332160	maybe early teenager within the book because there's this moment where you realize that
1332960	1340080	all of the structures that had given you some kind of standing within the world some kind of
1340080	1346160	help in terms of sense making and and all of this kind of collapsed at some point where you realized
1346160	1353600	that this so to speak moral agency that you that you talk about had actually been kind of absent
1353600	1359680	because you had been living within structures that were not kind of producing this moral agency
1359680	1366240	within the individuals and so you have this moment of realization that that all of this
1366240	1375040	actually was not given within your life up until this point i'd say no um yeah although i think
1375040	1378480	so this the thing is there is a difference between the perspective of a child and the
1378480	1382320	perspective of a grown-up and that's why the coming-of-age aspect of the book is really
1382320	1387120	important because in some ways it's about it's a book about reaching maturity and the ways in
1387120	1393120	which we come to discover the truth and in my case and also about the importance of education
1393120	1398000	and of people around you in bringing you to see these truths or to kind of not so much to see
1398000	1403360	the truth but to see ways of thinking about the truth and accessing it and in many ways it's a
1403360	1410720	story about the dangers of ideology and the the risks that every society that we live in every
1410720	1416400	system that we are under comes packaged with ideas or dominant discourses about how we should
1416400	1421200	understand that society how we should understand the system and they become part of the ordinary
1421200	1427600	language and part of the vocabulary with which we refer to that system and make it very hard for us
1427600	1433920	in some ways to kind of stand out but on the other hand it's also a story about resilience and the
1433920	1440320	fact that these critical capacities are always there as they are in my grandmother and often
1440320	1444880	being a mature person or being a moral agent is about realizing that these capacities are there
1444880	1450240	they may be more or less dormant and they may be depending on circumstances more possible or less
1450240	1454720	possible to be activated but i think it's really important that they are there because that is
1454720	1461920	the only thing that enables people to rise above ideology to rise about the given scripts to rise
1461920	1466080	above the fact that you get told slogans and that you internalize these slogans about the
1466080	1471120	world in which you live and you're never able to fully see beyond those slogans unless you discover
1471120	1477120	this kind of critical capacity that is in everyone interesting i'm still kind of trying to
1477120	1483680	to get an idea of whether or not this kind of entails some form of essentialism where there
1483680	1493920	is this like sensor that kind of makes you realize whether something is wrong or right it sounds a
1493920	1499600	bit like that there's a part in your book where you kind of reflect upon yourself and ask yourself
1499600	1505280	whether or not you might have become someone who would have never come to a position where
1505280	1511440	you would have had these moral agencies and so this at least within the book it sounds as if
1511440	1516160	you considered that this might have been a possibility so this would lead us to a place
1516160	1523680	where there is not an kind of sensor built within each and every individual that at the end will
1523760	1530160	reveal this kind of critical capacity but that there is indeed the possibility of like full
1530160	1540640	ideology so to speak where this this idea of critical reflection is so much like out of out
1540640	1548560	of the realm of possibility that it is not even considered yeah so this is not in the book it's
1548560	1552480	i mean this is not a question that i raise as a as a question as a philosophical question in the
1552480	1556560	book but i can tell you what i think about it so i think there is a kind of essentialism which is
1556560	1561920	an essentialism about reason and it's not an essentialism about you know a thing but it's an
1561920	1566960	essentialism about a capacity that only humans have to the extent that they have reason and so
1567760	1572320	the assumption that i make in my other work not in this work is that not in this book
1572320	1576720	is that to the extent that people have reason they have this capacity and this moral capacity
1576720	1581120	is the thing that is you know something that you can't alienate if you have reason then you're
1581120	1586000	able to see this and you may be able to hear it more strongly or less strongly so you may be a
1586000	1590320	victim again it's a question of nuance and different people will be exposed to these
1590320	1594880	influences in different ways so you have to allow for the possibility as i do in my book that i
1594880	1600480	might have become someone who was a state bureaucrat or or someone who in the end absorbs
1600480	1606000	a family narrative and turns against the state and becomes a dissident and so i don't deny that
1606000	1611760	personal histories and biographies condition how we think about freedom the extent to which
1611760	1616400	we are free but i also don't want to fully allow for that so i think it's somewhere and this is
1616400	1621600	why the book is ambiguous and this is why perhaps the the narrative voice of the book is one of
1621600	1626640	ambiguity because this and this is why it's a really a story that works with kind of showing
1626640	1630640	rather than trying to convince people that this is how it is you can just tell different stories
1630640	1635120	of different people and you can present them with different accounts and ways of understanding
1635120	1639920	themselves to make these arguments because they're not really it's not an either or i think and so
1640640	1646720	yeah fundamentally i am convinced that we all can see this that even a murderer or even a kind of
1646720	1652240	criminal or even someone who is purely or pure racist or whatever has something in them that
1652240	1656640	will at some point make them see that this is the right the wrong way to think about the world and
1656640	1661760	that you know that the way they are operating what they think is right is actually just their might
1661760	1668160	in a way and i'm kind of wedded to that world you it's a very and this but this is a very old
1668160	1675760	and long and in some ways unreconcilable debate which i think is to some extent really you only
1675760	1682640	reconcile it by somehow making a leap of faith in a way in humanity and in morality and and the
1682640	1687040	fact that reason entails this you can't completely resolve it but if you don't resolve it then you're
1687040	1690880	left with very little if you don't resolve it with this leap of faith then that is the basis for
1690880	1695520	every argument this is the base for democracy it's the basis for argumentation it's the basis
1695520	1700960	on which we try to convince each other and the basis on which we try to overcome our
1700960	1705440	particularity to try and have these conversations with each other and so if that's not there
1705440	1709120	all of these things become really difficult because we can never leave the position
1709840	1713680	from which we speak we can never leave our stories behind we can never leave our personal
1713680	1718560	histories we can never leave the conditioning behind and so i think it's just it's there's a
1718560	1722640	sense in which you ask yourself okay what can you do with these two conceptions and you discover
1722640	1727120	that with the one you can it's a starting point for something for a process and with the other
1727120	1733040	it doesn't really take you anywhere all right and we want to get to places so let's go along with
1733040	1738480	this one with this route and ask which kind of political economies might be best suited
1738480	1746160	to bring about this idea of freedoms in plural maybe and you briefly mentioned shock therapy
1746160	1752160	i did an episode with isabella m veba on her really great book how china escaped shock therapy
1752720	1759200	and unfortunately albania did not escape shock therapy if i'm not mistaken and there's a strand
1759200	1765920	of future histories that is dedicated to the question of democratic plant economies now you
1765920	1775280	have experienced uh hierarchical non-democratic central uh economies plant economies as well as
1775280	1781840	so-called liberal market economies so i would be very much interested in your opinion on the
1781840	1789360	question of democratic plant economies and their possibility my vote would go out for some type of
1789360	1795920	libertarian socialist plant economy i'd say which might be called in german freie planwirtschaft
1795920	1803040	this is a attack i really enjoy actually is this something you would consider given both your
1803040	1810320	experiences with different systems as well as your intellectual reflection yeah so i mean i can
1810320	1813920	i can speak to this but i'm not an expert on it so i'm not going to say anything that is
1813920	1820160	particularly authoritative or informed or you know that has thought through where my where my
1820160	1827520	critiques take me is basically to a point of radical rejection of capitalism i suppose and
1827520	1833040	of the monopolies of economic power and of the lack of control that the free market brings for
1833040	1837520	individuals and of the fact that there is a kind of doctrine of the free market which just happens
1837520	1843120	to be precisely the shock therapy doctrine the idea that you know unintended consequences produce
1843120	1848240	good things for from the vices of everyone there will be virtues and the to the extent that there
1848240	1852080	are costs these need to be borne by the individuals because it's just a matter of personal
1852080	1857360	responsibility and so there is a sense in which there is a faith in these anonymous forces of the
1857360	1862960	free market that i'm not particularly keen on because i think that's a loss of control and if
1862960	1869360	you care about freedom and agency that's one way in which you don't have that agency having said
1869360	1874800	that i think there are possible alternatives and there's many models but i'm also usually very
1874800	1880000	reluctant to say which of the models is the right one because i think it should be a matter of
1880000	1885120	democratic scrutiny and debate so what you can do is you can put you can say i think this is a model
1885120	1890320	that really doesn't work and so you know there's some things in the world that are just plain wrong
1890320	1894560	that are actually the dominant ones in the world in which we live you know there's concentrations
1894560	1901200	of wealth and power by both individuals and states that on this account of freedom are very easy to
1901200	1906320	point out that they're flawed and that should be rejected but then once you've done this work of
1906320	1913680	rejection you are left with a lot of possibilities and i don't think maybe i'm wrong on this but i
1913680	1918480	don't think i have any particular stake or any particular insight or any particular knowledge or
1918480	1922400	better knowledge than other people to say this is the way to go this is the right model because
1922400	1927600	my take is that a lot of these things should be subject to democratic scrutiny and that you
1927600	1931920	should create spaces for democratic interaction in which these different projects can emerge and be
1931920	1936800	confronted with each other and it's only when you have this exchange that you're actually really
1936800	1942240	able to see how they go and whether you can assess them fully it's only when they're articulated in
1942240	1946880	the public sphere and when they're articulated with the help of lots of different people not
1946880	1952960	just philosophers and not just economists and not just politicians but it's a kind of there's a
1952960	1957680	sense in which all of us contribute with our skills so articulating these views but there is
1957680	1962240	a political process through which these views need to be articulated and exchanged with each other
1962240	1968320	and then whatever emerges from this process is something that i would cherish and hold on to but
1968320	1974720	i don't want to say you know i think this is a way to go either you know because i think that's
1974720	1982080	one of the problems in some ways of both actually the tradition of democratic of central planning
1982080	1987120	and the tradition that that succeed that came after you know this idea of kind of making policy
1987120	1992560	without politics is precisely that people were so invested in coming up with the right policies
1992560	1997120	that they forget that every policy should be a matter for democratic debate and and that's what
1997120	2001520	i'm really keen on now it may be because i'm not an expert so i'm political theorist and so i care
2001520	2007760	about democracy and i think it's really important to get around this relationship between elites
2007760	2012480	or experts and the public in the right way and to articulate that relationship in the right way and
2012480	2018400	democracy helps us do that and so yeah i don't think i have a lot more in terms of the specifics
2018400	2025120	of the projects huh that's interesting because i mean i totally get it there it's absolutely
2025120	2033040	important to kind of point out the the critique and you have developed a an idea of freedom that
2033040	2040320	allows you to point towards different forms of of dysfunction where this freedom is actually not
2040320	2047440	being produced within the present but still this must at some point have led you to at least
2047440	2054800	wondering about how the kinds of freedoms that you would like to see being produced how they
2054800	2060080	could be brought about in which kind of like political economy they could be brought about
2060080	2066640	and i would say i totally understand it's not about like prescribing some kind of one best way
2066640	2071280	i absolutely share that but this doesn't mean that we should not engage in the question of
2072000	2078480	how could alternatives actually look like because if we do not do that then we kind of stand there
2078480	2085360	with empty hands if people are rightfully frustrated with the status quo actually and
2085360	2092800	we need to have i would say we need to have some kinds of ideas of how alternatives could
2093600	2099840	look like and it should be a plurality of ideas of course and they should be debated but there
2099840	2104800	should be ideas i mean i would say yeah yeah no no so i'm not saying i'm not saying there
2104800	2108480	shouldn't be ideas i'm just saying that i'm not the right person to articulate this political
2108480	2113600	economy proposal i see that's all i'm saying i'm saying there is a i'm saying there's a division
2113600	2119360	of labor in society whereby all of us do certain things and are better because of the knowledge
2119360	2124480	and the stories and whatever background they have at articulating different things and bringing them
2124480	2130000	in the public sphere and i'm just not someone who is able to speak competently on the question of
2130000	2134880	exactly you know what political economy do we need i'm saying that my take at a generic level
2134880	2140000	takes me to a criticism of capitalism as the system in which we live and so i think that what
2140000	2145440	we should be looking at is an economy beyond capitalism now you know where exactly how exactly
2145440	2152640	that works at at each level local national global at some level is a question of democratic debate
2152640	2158160	and so i i think i would still subscribe to that but at another level is you know in that democratic
2158160	2163200	debate what do what does each of us contribute and i don't contribute alternative policies
2163200	2167920	because that's not what i do and i don't know enough about that i see i see okay i know i get
2167920	2177360	it and but what you do actually contribute is a very concrete investigation of your own experience
2177360	2184800	and at some point at the end of the book where you have an epilogue you point towards a discussion
2184800	2190720	group a marxist discussion group with some of your friends i think in italy or maybe great britain
2190720	2196240	and you state that my friends is my friends socialism was clear bright and in the future
2196240	2206720	mine was messy bloody and of the past end quote and i think what you also try or at least it
2206720	2214720	seemed to me as if what you try there is pointing us towards maybe what you just said i'm not the
2214720	2220640	one to paint a picture of a concrete alternative political economy but what i can bring to the
2220640	2227440	table is looking back at these concrete experiences and there's something to be learned from those
2228080	2233840	so what is it that you want to show your friends from the study group and us as readers when
2233840	2238720	looking at these stories these people these experiences what what do they bring forth
2239680	2246480	yeah i think in a way exactly what you said so this sensitivity to history and to historical
2246480	2251600	circumstances i mean for me that sentence about you know their socialism was in the future and
2251600	2256560	mine was in the past really is a sentence about biography because here there are you know these
2256560	2263680	western former liberals who have turned radicals who only think about you know how what this future
2263680	2269040	is going to be and how future society will be and in thinking about that dismiss the history
2269040	2274480	of real world socialism as though it wasn't relevant to these kinds of thinking about the
2274480	2280320	future to these kinds of projects where to me one of the most important questions to ask is
2280320	2286240	why do societies that subscribe to these principles why did they fail historically what did they do
2286240	2291440	wrong and one of them is to do about the absence of democracy this is why i kind of care so much
2291440	2294800	about democracy and the fact that it's not you know you don't it's not about having the right
2294800	2299440	policy having the right principle having the right vision it's actually about having the right
2299440	2305520	environment for enabling conversations to be had that often take a confrontational form that
2306320	2311920	where you actually have this robust possibility of speaking between different alternatives and
2311920	2316720	where you radicalize democracy rather than suppressing it as these societies historically
2316720	2322640	did who better who worse you know who more who less and so there's again there's nuances there
2322640	2327440	and to me to treat to put all of these societies in one big bag as I say in the book you know to
2327440	2333200	say oh these are failed socialisms like China, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Albania when
2333200	2338640	they're so different and when they have all these internal debates with each other is to be completely
2338640	2342880	ignorant of the past but in a way that is also hampering for your own thinking of the future
2342880	2347520	because there's a wealth of knowledge there and resources that you need to engage with in order
2347520	2353280	to be able to reflect on possibilities for changing societies again compatibly with these
2353280	2359840	ideals and so I think that's the that's the simple story in a way so there I'm encountering this
2359840	2364800	group of people who only thinks about the future and comes from a very different experience and
2364800	2368960	on the other hand my socialism when I came out of Albania and that's my that's why that sentence is
2368960	2375120	there really is just associated to the past and lacks a future and so it's the exact opposite it's
2375120	2380880	I come from a place in which people think well socialism is done and dusted and there is no way
2380880	2386960	to think about it for the future and I'm someone who wants to still be able to contemplate the
2386960	2390400	ideas because she thinks that there is something in the critique of capitalism because she thinks
2390400	2397120	there's something in the kind of account of democracy that is there in the in the thought
2397120	2401360	processes and in the intellectual tradition that is important to recover
2401360	2406320	and so you have on the one hand the people with a wealth of knowledge about the past but no
2406880	2411440	beliefs in the future and here you have another people who has a lot of stuff to say about the
2411440	2414880	future but doesn't want to engage with the past and there's something missing in these
2414880	2419360	interactions that I think there's a kind of gap that needs to be bridged and can only be bridged
2420000	2425360	with I think an open mind to how history works and to the fact that you never as I say in the
2425360	2429440	beginning of the book you never make history out of your own free will but you make it
2429440	2434720	nevertheless and it's important to engage with both of these thoughts and to and to hold tensions
2437040	2442800	Brilliant and I guess what you do with the book is exactly that you you kind of mediate between
2442800	2451520	these words between the the the also contemporary Albania and the non-futures that they like
2451520	2456800	experience somewhat what is the experience in doing that because I saw that you you went on
2456800	2463920	tv shows in Albania so you interacted with the Albanian public on this topic so how did the
2463920	2471280	they receive this book how do they receive this this whole notion of trying to get to different
2471280	2477920	points of reflecting on on the history of Albania and trying to gain something out of it
2478640	2485280	I would say that it's divided the the opinion is divided but sometimes it's divided by politics
2485280	2489440	in the way in which it would be here as well if you were to try and say you know I think socialism
2489440	2493200	still has a future it's probably quite likely that you'll meet a lot of people who will say no
2493200	2498000	socialism only has a past and this is the past and in Albania obviously that's much more life
2498000	2504080	because of the actual past and the kind of past that it is so it's also somewhat understandable
2504080	2508880	the other part of the the critical reception of the book is that obviously the book does a
2508880	2514720	lot with the history of Albania and does a lot with Albania as such but I also say that when
2514720	2518640	here as I'm doing here it's also a book about ideas and kind of it's a philosophical book in
2518640	2523680	many ways and there is a worry that if you come from a small country and you've written a book
2523680	2529120	that a lot of people read outside that small country and that is successful by some criterion
2529120	2535760	there is a worry that that book becomes the story of that country which is understandable and so I
2535760	2540880	think there is a bit of reaction and resentment with that because it's it's only my story it's
2540880	2545440	not everyone's story and it's also my ideas it's not everyone's ideas and so there is a
2545440	2551520	word that if this is a book about Albania that explains Albanian transition to the western world
2551520	2556320	there is a burden of responsibility on one book and one author which an author in a book from a
2556320	2561600	dominant hegemonic country doesn't usually have but that's completely understandable that people
2561600	2567280	are frustrated and sometimes resentful because you know they think there's another way of talking
2567280	2573520	about this past which is not mine and I share that and I understand that so I think but that
2573520	2578320	speaks to the in some ways to the to the problems with the way in which the book market works and
2578320	2582880	the way with circulation of knowledge works and dominant cultures operate and how they engage with
2582880	2586480	smaller cultures which I think as I say it's a kind of legitimate word but not one that you
2586480	2590880	can really bear the burden of as an author whereas when it comes to the politics I think
2592240	2596160	I mean it's hard to say because this is another question that often comes up as people say to me
2596160	2601680	are you comparing kind of socialism with liberalism and in a way the thing is that liberal period is
2601680	2605520	still going on in Albania so it's really hard to compare something that's complete with something
2605520	2611280	that's not complete right and and so people often read the book as a book of comparison when it's
2611280	2616000	actually not it's a book about freedom and how ideas of freedom emerge in different circumstances
2616000	2621760	and by different characters but I think it's in some ways revealing of the mindset of the country
2621760	2626000	which is about you know there's these two alternatives and one is the past and one is
2626000	2630000	the future and the one is about the future is something that we still need to hold on to
2630000	2633760	otherwise what do we get we still get the past and so it's really hard to get out of this binary
2633760	2638960	logic which is what you know the country has been stuck in for the last 30 years which was there
2638960	2643440	when it's emerged because there was this idea of the end of history and you know if it's not that
2643440	2648800	and so in some ways I think ideologically at least this notion that there is no alternative
2648800	2652720	is still there and it's still very powerful and perhaps not just in Albania but also in other
2652720	2659760	countries yes indeed it is and I mean at the end you you saw a system change in real life so you
2659760	2664800	experienced the system change though so that makes it kind of a little bit easier to see that of
2664800	2669600	course things could be different you know and I mean there are many people in within
2670480	2675040	western countries for sure that still very much stick to this idea of capitalist realism
2675920	2680880	that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism so
2680880	2686400	you have seen different systems of political economy so you you know for sure it's not true
2686400	2692160	so that's kind of a positive I would say in your in your last answer you briefly said
2692800	2700160	that you do believe that socialism has a future so do you because you were kind of reluctant
2700960	2708800	when it comes to describing alternative political economies like concrete alternatives but you would
2708800	2716000	say that there is something to to gain when looking at specifically socialism and the communist
2716000	2722560	traditions and the theoretical work and stuff like that yeah yeah sure yeah I mean that's
2722560	2726880	something that I subscribe to it's not that like I call myself a socialist and I have a socialist
2726880	2732240	and just as just as I'm an anti-capitalist no I was more talking about you know specific aspects
2732240	2736880	of prescriptions and you know what concrete proposals you could make about how exactly to
2736880	2740960	run I don't know a democratic enterprise and how to engage with the market forces when you're
2740960	2745280	running a democratic enterprise these are the kinds of more detailed things that or you know
2745280	2749920	how to create what would it look like exactly for the European Union to turn into a federal
2749920	2756320	socialist entity which I think what is what it should turn into but I think of it as that more
2756320	2760400	as a kind of democratic project that needs to be out there not I don't have a specific fully
2760400	2764320	worked out conception of how exactly it needs to be reformed along those lines but I do think that
2764320	2768240	it needs to be reformed along those lines so yeah that's not that's not that's not where my
2768240	2776800	skepticism is coming from I see so so do you think we need some some kind of new meta narratives
2776800	2785440	that are able to to carry this like pluralism of freedoms this pluralism of different ideas that
2785440	2791280	will need to be kind of democratically thought out and thought out but do you do you think that
2791920	2796240	that we need some some kind of carrier in terms of new meta narratives
2798240	2802320	I mean I wonder what the new meta narrative would be for me it's actually very simple I think we
2802320	2808160	need to be united in our rejection of the status quo as a system I think it's there is a lot
2808160	2813360	packed in that but basically people need to for me as I see it maybe I'm wrong and maybe this is
2813360	2817840	another thing that needs to be tested democratically but my conviction is that the sooner we give up
2818240	2822720	on the possibility of reforming capitalism the better off we will be in terms of thinking about
2822720	2828400	alternatives and so where you start off is by saying I want my critique of the system in which
2828400	2834080	I live to be really radical and I want to aspire to a new foundation of a new system at a legal
2834080	2838480	level at a political level at an economic level at a local level at a global level so it's basically
2838480	2844080	a kind of alternative global outlook basically and of course this is not something that a single
2844080	2848080	person can do you know and I don't think it was ever something that a single person could do so
2848080	2853040	I think it's foolish to think okay but you have a theory or do you have a what hey how is it exactly
2853040	2858560	how is it going to work exactly because that's you know the work of a collective but that this
2858560	2864080	is the starting point to me seems very elementary and in fact you wake up every day and you look at
2864080	2868800	the world and it seems pretty obvious that that's exactly what needs to happen but maybe just you
2868800	2874720	know Brecht used to say the simplicity difficult to make and that's the kind of thing that we're
2874720	2880480	up against in a way that is so intuitive that there should be an alternative system of social
2880480	2887520	relations and one that is in a way makes good on this promise of moral world and these promises
2887520	2891920	of freedom that are in all our constitutions in all our legal documents in all our political
2891920	2898640	rhetoric and the discourses and then and yet fail miserably everywhere around us and I think
2898720	2903680	if you just point out and in some ways the role of the book was that to point out this gap between
2903680	2908000	the ideals that we all subscribe to and the realities that we're all surrounded by and the
2908000	2913040	sooner we realize that there's a reason why the reality doesn't match the ideals is because we're
2913040	2920560	in the wrong system the better off we will be and the experience of engaging with in some ways kind
2920560	2926000	of going back to these debates around 1990 and so on is that it seems to me 1990 for all its failures
2926000	2931120	and for all this the way it went wrong there was this possibility this moment this opening
2931120	2936800	where people actually thought okay now we could build better and we could do there was a sort of
2936800	2941040	an opening of the imagination at least in Eastern Europe maybe in the West it was never like that
2941040	2945040	maybe the West always thought you know they had won and that was it but I think in Eastern Europe
2945040	2951200	there was genuinely a moment of hope and thinking that now things would be different and people
2951200	2955680	finally had agency just before they were then flooded with you know the shock therapy and the
2955680	2961680	liberal markets and so on and it's that spirit of dissidents of the 90s coupled with the hope
2961680	2966320	that the system can change for the better as opposed to for some other kind of bad
2966960	2970400	that my book tries to recover and that I always try to convey.
2971360	2977520	And just to maybe for the books or for the record I sense some kind of misunderstanding here my
2977520	2983760	question is not so much oriented towards that the idea that I think that you have the answers or
2983760	2989600	one answer anything as such I'm perfectly aware of that it's not one person that will have this
2989600	2997360	answer but I'm still very much interested in kind of what are the agents in very much in plural the
2997360	3006720	communities the movements the collectives and the metanarratives that that will together form
3008160	3016400	some kind of carrier that will then move forward from the point of recognizing that the status quo
3016400	3022240	is perfectly fucked up and you need to change it. Right right so I think I mean there's two stories
3022240	3028320	there it's either those who experience it or those who reflect on it right so there are some
3028320	3033760	who will experience the failings and the oppression on their skin right they will have it it will be
3033760	3038160	part of their day-to-day lives that the way in which the system misdelivers for them or the way
3038160	3041760	in which system betrays them or the way in which it doesn't realize their freedoms so there will
3041760	3048640	be a sense in which the agents are the victims of the system but there's another part in which
3048640	3053280	I think it's also important that other you know Kant would have called them impartial spectators
3053280	3058320	there's a lot of people out there who may not necessarily be victims but who may reflect on the
3058320	3063280	plight of those who are victims and who are engaging with the kinds of injustice and the
3063280	3068400	kinds of oppressions that there are and they are also agents and so there is this you know debate
3068400	3073360	amongst marxists on class consciousness and whether you know it's something in itself or for itself
3073360	3079120	whether something you can develop or something you need to be born with and I think I'm very open
3079120	3084240	on that debate I don't think that you have to be a victim of oppression yourself to be able to have
3084240	3090000	an interest in emancipation along those lines you can also just engage with it and see and there's
3090000	3096960	different points from which you can engage with it but yeah so I think the agents can be constructed
3096960	3103600	by reflecting and by diagnosing the wrongs of the world and by looking at the gaps and the cracks in
3103600	3108640	the system and the failures and you know different in this plural sites of struggle you know there
3108640	3112560	will be workers there will be environmental crises there will be financial credit all the
3112560	3118960	different crises that we encounter will each of them produce the agents that are necessary to go
3118960	3124320	beyond the status quo and to try and think about the future in the right way and then
3124320	3128800	there's a last question that I ask all of my guests which is if you think about the future
3128800	3134800	what makes you joyful yeah and there is an answer I always give when I get answered that question
3134800	3140480	which is that I am a Kantian and I have a duty to hope and so I don't have to there doesn't have
3140480	3148000	to be anything but in the world makes me hopeful because I think hope is a duty and to the extent
3148000	3152080	that you have reason and to the extent that you're engaging and you're in the world and you're
3152080	3157440	trying to do things then there is no alternative to being hopeful you can't carry on if you're
3157440	3161520	not hopeful and so you know the question of is there anything in the world that makes me
3161520	3165360	hopeful or not it's I don't know it doesn't matter it's not it's not important to me that
3165360	3168640	can be nothing it could be a desert it could be horrible and I would still be hopeful
