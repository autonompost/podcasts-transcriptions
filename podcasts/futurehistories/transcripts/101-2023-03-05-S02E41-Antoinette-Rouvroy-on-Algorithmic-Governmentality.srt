00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,000
Antoinette Rovois in today's episode.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,760
It's a Future Histories live episode that you are about to hear, meaning it has been

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,680
recorded in front of an audience, in this case, in the context of the workshop Biological

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,820
Life and Political Cybernetics that took place in December 22 in Vienna.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,460
And I want to thank the organizers Anna Verena-Nosthoff, Eugenia Stamboljeff and Vessel Reyes for

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,640
the possibility to take part in this, it has been great, thanks a lot.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,140
And I am happy to announce that this is not a single workshop, but a series of workshops

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,140
on the topic of political cybernetics and that I myself will organize an instance of

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,620
this series at Kiel University as part of the research project Governing Algorithms.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
I'll definitely keep you updated on that.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,820
I also want to send a quick shout out to the Critical Data Lab, which I'm also affiliated

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:11,560
to and which was, through Anna Verena-Nosthoff, also involved in the organization of the Political

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,400
Cybernetics Workshop in Vienna.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,720
Many thanks to everybody involved in general, it has been a pleasure.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,480
Before we start, I would like to welcome Manchu and Dahlia as patrons of Future Histories

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,240
and I want to thank Fabian, Lucas and Karl for their kind donations.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,240
And now, please enjoy today's episode with Antoinette Rovois on Algorithmic Governmentality.

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,280
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,340
Antoinette Rovois in today's episode.

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,960
She is a permanent research associate at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,560
and a researcher and professor at the University of Namur in Belgium.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,360
Her work centers around evolving normativities at the interface of legal theory, philosophy

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,280
and science and technology studies using, for course, insights on questions of government.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,060
She has developed an analytic framework called Algorithmic Governmentality, which we will

26
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,420
explore in today's conversation.

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,620
Welcome Antoinette.

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Thank you.

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Thank you for having me.

30
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,120
It's a great pleasure.

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,080
Let's maybe start with a broad definition for people who are not familiar with your

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
work.

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
What is algorithmic governmentality?

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:39,880
Well, I must first say that my intention with that concept or that notion or that non-concept

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,540
rather of algorithmic governmentality has never been to find the right epochal ladder

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,280
for something like a social totality.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,740
If I speak of governmentality, it is precisely in order to avoid delimiting the social as

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
a totality.

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:04,220
I don't speak of algorithmic society any more than of a surveillance society.

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,840
Algorithmic governmentality does not, in the sense that I use the term, designate a particular

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,580
mode of government which would have more or less replaced or been juxtaposited to the

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,160
forms of sovereignty, pastorate, discipline, normalization, control and so on that Foucault

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,920
and in fact, Foucault himself did not consider that sovereignty, surveillance, discipline,

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,260
control and so on corresponded to a strict chronologic periodization.

45
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,920
It was not for him a series in which the elements follow one another.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,660
It is rather a complex edifice in which the center of gravity shifts in the systems of

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,440
correlations between legality, discipline, security, control and I would add with Felix

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:04:00,240
Guattari integration and I would add with a lot of you, with most of you, recursivity.

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,160
These shift at the core of governmental rationalities.

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,460
The way I try to inherit of the non-concept of governmentality from Foucault is I must

51
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:19,800
concede right away quite unfaithful, at least partially, to the original meaning ascribed

52
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,760
to the term by Michel Foucault in the series of lectures he held at the CollÃ¨ge de France

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:35,640
in 1978 and 1973 and I would say that because since I wrote about algorithmic governmentality

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:44,520
first, it was a long, long time ago, my own thinking has evolved and I have come to understand

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,620
that in fact algorithmic governmentality or algorithmic capitalism was not a mode of ordering

56
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
of the world.

57
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:01,580
It is not a mode of organization, but it's rather a tactic or a system of disorganization

58
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:11,520
of organized and strategic disruption, which is highly profitable to the ones who Mackenzie

59
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,520
work called the vectorialist class.

60
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:23,080
But of course, we are all part of this and I will try to develop that a little bit later.

61
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:31,720
So I refer to, also I must say right away that I refer to governmentality mainly as

62
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,560
a methodological perspective that orients our attention away from the classical invariance

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,020
of political science, the state, institutions, the subjects.

64
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,100
From a governmentality perspective, the state, institutions, the subjects are not presupposed

65
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,480
or pre-existent to governmentality.

66
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,220
They are rather it's byproducts.

67
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:08,380
So governmentality allows me to try to diagnose or to produce a kind of clinics or analytics

68
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:15,140
of a series of semiotic, epistemic, normative, strategic, anthropological, ethical shifts

69
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,600
in the processes or techniques of signification, that is production of meaning, in techniques

70
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,940
of power or domination and in techniques of the self.

71
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:33,020
Foucault's notion of governmentality or what he calls governmental rationality, which corresponds

72
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,160
in this sense to what, for example, Castoriadis calls the imaginary institution of society

73
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,200
is above all, for me, a way of making consistent, of articulating, of showing the entanglement

74
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:55,840
in each era of a set of techniques of signification, meaning making, techniques of production,

75
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,120
techniques of power and techniques of self.

76
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:09,080
This being said, what I have as a target are indeed the new effects of reliability or credibility

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
in the post-truth era where we are, as is often said, the unprecedented effects of power

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,800
or operationality without authority, and therefore responsibility, or the force without law,

79
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,680
and an individualization or molecularization and deterritorialization without subjects.

80
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,040
Therefore, I speak with others of inhuman biopolitics, the instrumental unit of power

81
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:52,800
being not anymore the population, individuals, or the bodies, but only meaningless data.

82
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,520
So this being said about governmentality, now, why algorithmic governmentality?

83
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,480
My algorithmic governmentality with my colleague Thomas Berns, we had in mind a kind of hypothesis

84
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,320
a hypothesis of a government of the social world based on the algorithmic meaning automatic

85
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:21,120
processing of the massive data proliferating from our behaviors by behaviors, I understand

86
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,400
all the interactions we have with the environment, relationships, interactions, trajectories,

87
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,740
and so on.

88
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:37,620
So processing of massive data proliferating from our behaviors rather than on politics,

89
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,860
law, social norms, in a multitude of sectors of activity and government.

90
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,540
We therefore call algorithmic government or algorithmic governmentality a mode of government

91
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,100
which is productive not of norms, neither of standards or rules, which in fact fails

92
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,100
to adjudicate and which is fed essentially by raw data, by which I mean,

93
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,500
intrapersonal and significant but quantifiable signals.

94
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,380
Also, algorithmic governmentality operates by anticipatory configurations of possibilities

95
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:25,620
through anticipatory optimization of environments rather than by regulation, permission, prohibition,

96
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,340
and so on.

97
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:36,060
But as I will tell, no, my current thought about it is rather that, in fact, it's not

98
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:48,060
even trying to govern anything, it's rather trying to render power absolutely agile, able

99
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:55,420
to be resilient to any kind of transformation, any kind of emergence.

100
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:04,620
So that's really the speculative term that algorithmic governmentality marks.

101
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,420
So we have also defined in some of our papers algorithmic governmentality very broadly

102
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:21,660
as a certain type of normative or apolitical rationality founded or grounded on the automated

103
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,740
collection, aggregation, and analysis of big data so as to model, anticipate, and

104
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,700
preemptively affect possible behaviors.

105
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:40,060
So, of course, when reading and rereading Foucault and Deleuze, I realized it was not

106
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,140
very, very original.

107
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:51,260
In fact, already in 1979, Foucault announced this on the horizon of liberal governmentality

108
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:59,100
what appears is not at all the idea or the project of an exhaustively disciplinary society

109
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,260
in which the legal network, enclosing individuals, would be related and extended from within

110
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,860
by, let us say, normative mechanisms, nor is it a society in which the mechanisms of

111
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,460
general normalization and exclusion of the non-normalizable would be required.

112
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,420
On the contrary, on the horizon is the image or the idea or theme of a society in which

113
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,700
there would be optimization of systems of difference, in which the field would be left open

114
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,940
to auxiliary processes, in which there would be tolerance for minority individuals and

115
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,900
practices, in which there would be action not on the players of the game but on the

116
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,860
rules of the game, and finally, in which there would be intervention not on the type of

117
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,740
internal subjugation of individuals but intervention of an environmental type.

118
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,180
In the next lesson, Foucault reminded of the heterodox definition of economics given by

119
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:07,020
Gary Baker, the science of systematicity of responses to environmental variations, a

120
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,540
definition Foucault told us which can perfectly include the behavioral techniques that had been

121
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:20,540
promoted in particular by Skinner about whom Foucault also writes that he was hostile to the

122
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,580
use of statistics, that he considers that individual behaviors must be studied, which presupposes

123
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,660
that we control the environment in which we place the subject and that we define measures

124
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:41,420
of response which are informative. When a subject moves in his environment, some of his behaviors

125
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,900
produce detectable changes in the environment, the reinforcement contingencies. The operant

126
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:54,460
response is a class of responses defined by the consequences they have for the subject and issued

127
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,660
in a given situation without being causally dependent on a stimulus in the situation.

128
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:07,100
That's really the kind of data behaviorism that I have tried to describe, in which in fact

129
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,340
insights replace knowledge and in fact it completely disturbs that the idea that

130
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:22,540
Foucault had that in fact power is always based and co-produced with knowledge.

131
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,780
Here the conjunction of knowledge and power is completely exploded. There is no need for

132
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:37,260
knowledge to govern and it's even the opposite. It's a way through which contingency and

133
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:47,980
non-knowledge and ignorance become the target of speculative and leveraging strategies.

134
00:13:47,980 --> 00:14:00,620
So we are not exactly in the situation described by Foucault. Why? Of course we perceive all that

135
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:09,740
modulation that we have left modernist way of government and so on, but I would say we are

136
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:19,660
even further than what he anticipated in 79. Why is it? Because in fact there is no action

137
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,900
on the rules of the game or if there are actions on the rules of the game,

138
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:32,940
these rules are not even any more detectable or subjectively recognizable by the players.

139
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:40,060
Why is that? Because in algorithmic governmentality what we notice is that even

140
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:48,300
metrics against which behaviors or performances are evaluated, ranked, scored and so on,

141
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,740
metrics have become increasingly plastic. They are not fixed. They are not knowable in advance.

142
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:04,780
They are moving and evolving according to the behaviors of all others. What that means is

143
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:13,420
that we are not any more confronted with the kind of subject produced by algorithmic governmentality

144
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:21,740
is completely at odds with the notion of the homo hemoconomicus described by Gary Becker,

145
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:34,620
the homo economicus who had to invest rationally in his own human capital by being able to

146
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:46,060
anticipate what kind of returns his investment would grant him. No, people never know how they

147
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:56,380
will be evaluated and the metrics are so moving that in fact we can have the impression that this

148
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:05,820
shift from modernist normativity towards recursive plasticity of abnormativity,

149
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:18,060
that cybernetic mode of government, it can appear really emancipatory but it is paid,

150
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:27,900
it is at the cost of transforming individuals into people who are completely addicted

151
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:35,100
to credit so they have to find credit to gain attention, to gain audience, to be

152
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:44,780
noticed, it means to occupy a node in the network. So in fact it's a kind of anomaly,

153
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:54,380
that's the reason why in beginning to respond too long to your question, I said it's a system

154
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:03,980
of disorganization. It's a system of disorganization because it fragments all subjectively and

155
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:14,220
collectively recognizable forms into pure decontextualized signals which are re-aggregated

156
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:23,580
at an industrial scale which is not personal nor collective nor nothing, which are pure speculative

157
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:32,700
in which pure speculative spaces are created, speculative spaces of opportunities and risks.

158
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,580
I have the impression that I have transformed this discussion into a monologue so don't

159
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:48,380
hesitate to interrupt me if you wish. Well I'll just wait until you have finished making your

160
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:56,300
point so that's all right with me. Okay so maybe in order to give some

161
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:08,700
consistency, some materiality to what I'm saying here, I guess just a few examples.

162
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,660
For example there is a new system of employee monitoring developed by Amazon in its warehouse

163
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:23,020
and in the vehicle of their delivery drivers. In the online presentation Amazon presents the

164
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,180
monitoring system as humanizing the interaction transportation companies have with their drivers

165
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:37,020
to enhance driving performance. Indeed what matters in this humanization is to enable

166
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,580
artificial intelligence systems to better understand or rather better act as if they

167
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:50,380
understood the humans in their interactions with their environment. Of course what matters to

168
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,620
Amazon is not at all understanding or legibility of each individual employee, their motivations,

169
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,420
their intentions or the singularity of their experiences. In fact individual warehouse

170
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:10,380
workers are eminently substituable or replaceable anyway. It is not their singularity that Amazon

171
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:17,660
has an interest in nor is Amazon primarily interested in acquiring knowledge about the

172
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,540
productivity of the workforce in general but rather it's interested in rendering individual

173
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,940
workers every move computable in a data behaviorist paradigm. This is the kind of

174
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,300
data behaviorism allowing humanization of interactions contemplated by Amazon.

175
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,620
To humanize in this discourse means to scale power down to the molecular level,

176
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,820
to leverage particularities not singularities but particularities. Conveniently from the

177
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:59,900
perspective of a neoliberal management these particularities escape both subjective identification,

178
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,420
recognition and collective perception and discussion.

179
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,260
It is of course as I said not the singularity of individual experiences that are of interest to

180
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,500
Amazon nor the regularities observed in the workforce population but rather the mostly

181
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,060
subliminal particularities of behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. The individual and

182
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:32,380
collective trade unionist and so on subjects how they may or may not acknowledge experiences

183
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:39,820
their own and so on do not matter at all. They disappear from powers gaze. Singular and collective

184
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,220
experiences drastically fall in value and power operates on the mode of machining enslavement

185
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:54,220
rather than social subjection. So enabling everything to be connected to communicate

186
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:01,660
or synchronize with everything else in almost real time the computational term appears to

187
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,540
disqualify all kinds of representations including predictions based on statistical representations

188
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,540
which never pretend to be adequate to the world but merely to provide approximative representations

189
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:22,780
of it with an objective of neutrality. All these even statistical representations are felt as

190
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:31,820
anarchisms sorry archaisms in favor of a post-representational recursive paradigm of

191
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:39,100
disintermediated access to the digital real in high resolution which is also a high dissolution

192
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:46,620
at the pre-semiotic stage emancipated from the symbolic order from the tyranny of the signifier

193
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:55,740
from the imperialism of language itself. So and I will end maybe my attempt to

194
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,860
to not define algorithmic or neutrality by this I would say that

195
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,020
the aim but I will maybe later further explain this the aim is not so much to manage or influence

196
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,500
the individuals and groups but to render power absolutely agile capable of leveraging the

197
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,660
contingency of individual and collective behaviors whereas data drivenness attest to the replacement

198
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:30,060
of both the commodity form and currency by assets all that matters is the convertibility

199
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:37,820
of contingent data into speculative assets so the hallmark of power in algorithmic regime

200
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:45,260
is not so much that it would look at us spy on us but rather that it literally bypass the visual

201
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:53,100
epistem the phenomenological perceptual systems of recognition of qualification of judgment of

202
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,420
categories in favors of systems of recursive computation as a consequence algorithmic

203
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,260
governmentality is quite indifferent to what is present to what appears consistent and real to

204
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,740
our ordinary senses as it shifts towards the forward-looking detection of contingent patterns

205
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,540
as novel latent speculative spaces which are in no way subjectively or collectively recognizable

206
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:30,300
so yes maybe I don't know if this fits as a broad indication of

207
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:38,780
what algorithmic governmentality is about as a problem. Yes well let me jump in I would be

208
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,180
interested at this point in in two things one would be that in one of your texts at some point

209
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:51,660
you coming from this critique of algorithmic governmentality you continue to argue for a

210
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,260
quote-unquote return to reality so I would be interested actually what you mean by reality in

211
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,420
this case so what is it coming from this critique that you try to bring forward maybe as a I don't

212
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:09,020
know how to call it then counter ontology I don't know maybe so maybe you could state what you mean

213
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,980
with reality in this case this is one of the the questions that I have and the other one would be

214
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,980
that when reading the texts from time to time I was asking myself whether or not these descriptions

215
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,980
that you give of algorithmic governmentality I got the impression that they do absolutely fit

216
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:33,740
for some form of imaginary of algorithmic governing but that if we look at the

217
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:42,940
actual practice that this is not really an adequate description of how things are really

218
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:50,380
going going down and one example for this would be this phrase of raw data is an oxymoron and you

219
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:56,060
yourself state that the people who are actually working with these technologies are very much

220
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:02,700
aware that there that there are so many hands reaching into the algorithm that there is always

221
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,780
a co-production between the algorithm and the the humans who are working with it so that there is

222
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:15,580
not actually this place of perfection that you kind of describe when talking about algorithmic

223
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,980
governmentality who seems to be omnipotent when hearing about the critique and of course it's

224
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,700
powerful but it's not omnipotent and it didn't yet succeed in getting rid of the human I would say so

225
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,620
there is already this aspect of interpretation there's already this aspect of entanglement

226
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:43,260
there's already this aspect of human co-production always in place already in capitalist cybernetics

227
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,020
as well yes of course I hear what you say but I

228
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,860
I think that that's the most maybe the most difficult thing to to to to transmit

229
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,740
in fact what I say what I speak about what I speak about and I speak about it in my text as well

230
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:11,260
it it's a technical ideology it's a technical ideology of big data it means that what I speak

231
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:19,740
about is the kind of pretension but a pretension that even you know the designers of the of the

232
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:27,980
technology data scientists and so on they they are not naive realists they they know they know that

233
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:35,420
in fact big data doesn't mean exhaustivity that automatization or or algorithm don't

234
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:45,420
mean doesn't mean objectivity that non-selectivity or less obvious selectivity

235
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:54,140
doesn't mean impartiality and so on I think in fact and and that's the reason also why I

236
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:04,300
I refer to problematization the basic question I ask to myself first is is why is you know the

237
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:12,380
turning to algorithm and ambient intelligence artificial intelligence big data and so so on

238
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,940
why are these solutions presented as solutions without

239
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:26,380
and appearing as something absolutely obvious whereas they are presented by solution as solutions

240
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,140
but the kind of problem to which they are presented as a solution against which which they are

241
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:41,340
presented as solutions is never clearly stated and my my perception is that it is precisely

242
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:54,780
because in our society we we have a hatred for averages we all want to be unique and recognized

243
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:01,980
as unique we don't want to be part of a category anymore we want we all we all want personalization

244
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,780
and so on means that in fact there is a radical crisis of representation and by this I mean

245
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,820
not only the perception that all kinds of representations through which we perceive the

246
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:25,580
world is misleading is ideological is is politically suspect and so on it's not that

247
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:36,700
I think that there is behind this success of the algorithmic turn there is a kind of mystic

248
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:44,140
a mystic of immanence a mystic or a belief that it is in it would be possible at last

249
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:51,580
to touch rationally on the world and the things in themselves it is very close to the

250
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:59,740
speculative turn and the speculative realism in philosophy that's the reason why I'm writing

251
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:08,460
was about algorithmic realism but it's it's very it's of course absolutely absolutely

252
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:19,180
ideological of course the human is everywhere the human is in the it's the human who who designs or

253
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:26,940
who inscribes the the objective function the objective function of the algorithm

254
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:36,380
what is it it is the it's the indication of or the cost function it indicates what has to be

255
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,460
what has to be maximized what has to be minimized what has to be

256
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:50,860
optimized of course that objective function is nothing but the the formalization of the

257
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:58,140
sectoral sectorial interest or the sectorial logic of of the actor who's using the algorithm

258
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:05,500
so there there is there is a human there there is the human of course in social reality itself

259
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,420
and the mere fact the mere transcription of social reality of social

260
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:17,260
into into digital data which appear as facts I speak of a new kind of facticity

261
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,500
the simple transformation of reality of that reality social reality complex and so on into

262
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,540
data doesn't purge doesn't

263
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:38,300
expurgate that reality from all the domination the repose of domination relation over dominations

264
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:45,420
and so on in fact as you say data raw data don't exist it it's not only that raw data is always

265
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,500
of course it is it's a it's a patient work of

266
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:59,980
of this indexization anonymization and so on producing raw data is a is a hard work

267
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:09,500
but it's not it's not only that it's also that producing raw data is organizing the amnesia

268
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,620
of data with regard to their the condition of their production that's the reason why it's

269
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,540
I say it's a it's ideological it hides its own conditions of of production so

270
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:32,860
so it's not that I in the question you you sent me I read that I don't only criticize the concept

271
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,180
of a truth founded in probability I I never I I never criticized the concept of a truth

272
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:45,100
founded in probability because following Foucault for me truth the notion of truth

273
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:53,900
is always the result of truth regimes truth regime it's truth is always produced it's something that

274
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:02,140
is added to the world it's nothing nothing that you can find in the world and that's the also you

275
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:11,340
know the the false promise of of big data or the idea of the ideology of the technical ideology of

276
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:19,260
big data is the idea that knowledge shouldn't have to be produced anymore that it can be discovered

277
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,500
in the data that it's always already imminent in the data and provided you use the right algorithm

278
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:34,380
you will you you you will find or knowledge will or truth will will arise spontaneously

279
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,900
that's exactly that kind of naive realism that I'm combating

280
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,820
the as as strongly as I can and you find that that same kind of naive realism

281
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:58,780
in a lot of of techno-critics who really work on on the idea of rendering algorithms

282
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:05,180
fair accountable transparent and so on meaning that they want to correct the algorithms with

283
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:12,860
the idea of with the idea that if algorithms are fair are just are you know are accountable and so

284
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:22,780
on then we will have a perfect access an objective access to what is you know without human

285
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:32,060
intermediation that's that this that's really mad that's the madness because I think first of all

286
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,580
there are several reasons of course the first obvious reason is that the notion of just the

287
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:44,220
notions notions such as justice or concepts such as justice fairness and so on are dialectical

288
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:51,580
concepts dialectical concepts are not easily formalizable into what george school nicolas

289
00:33:51,580 --> 00:34:01,020
george school again call uh uh uh arithmo uh arithmomorphic concepts arithmomorphic concepts

290
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:08,620
in george school against uh uh uh civilization are concepts which are exactly what you know

291
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:15,580
the result of an optimizations of an algorithmic optimization is you know just one result yes or

292
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:22,460
not that's algorithm that's sure you know you don't have to discuss but justice is not something like

293
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:30,140
it's really dialectical it means that it's it is a concept um which has a

294
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:37,340
which is distinct of course but not discretizable not discretizable

295
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:48,700
and that's that that's hugely important maybe i can yes i will read you i i had that um that

296
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:55,580
passage of a george school george school again uh and for george school again the the the

297
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:02,060
arithmomorphic character of a concept is linked to the fact that there is a definitive discrete

298
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:08,780
border between what this and what is not what it is not what it is and what it is not the possibility

299
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:15,340
of defining a big univocal relation between a set of concepts and a numerical scale makes it

300
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,620
possible for example to attest to the arithmomorphic character of the concept in this set

301
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:30,380
um but but there are another kind other another world of concept which are all the concepts that

302
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:40,860
we we human use as we are uh uh because we are not inhuman and those not inhuman concepts are all

303
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:53,420
are all uh dialectical i think so um so for for reality uh i think it was a misunderstanding

304
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:01,900
there was a misunderstanding there uh if i the reality i i don't i don't remember having written

305
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,900
that but uh if i help you for a return to reality the kind of reality i would like to return to

306
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:18,300
is the reality that is added to the world added by our own collective productions of meaning so

307
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:27,100
um that's the dialectical reality i i would uh i would argue for there are a series of conditions

308
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:34,060
for this kind of additional uh additional uh reality to to occur

309
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:43,740
and the first conditions are special and temporal we need scenes to discuss about

310
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:51,900
dialectical concepts uh but maybe i go too too far in my answers i don't know if if it

311
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:59,180
fits what you had in mind well if it was merely a misunderstanding you think then we could continue

312
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,540
to other questions and i would just maybe to clear something up and since we are here on

313
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:12,300
in the workshop on um cybernetic politics i just wanted to ask if i maybe understood it wrong

314
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:19,180
right now in your answer when you pointed towards a kind of naive realism which is kind of close to

315
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,260
speculative realism which you say is an kind of this naive realism is an aspect of algorithmic

316
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,740
governmentality as well as of some of the critics i'm actually wondering because i always thought

317
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:39,980
that cybernetics actually does not really care about ontology in this sense but is absolutely

318
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:47,020
fine with something that would be called a probable truth so it's not about really kind of trying to

319
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:54,140
unveil some kind of essence i always thought that this is absolutely not a logic found within the

320
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:02,060
cybernetic paradigm but as i said instead it would totally be fine with a version that simply works

321
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:08,060
or works better than the other one so this is what i meant with a truth founded in probability

322
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:13,660
and i would say that this is really a fundamental difference so i was wondering if you think that

323
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,820
algorithmic governmentality is in this respect different from cybernetics or why you say that

324
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:26,540
they are trying to kind of get to the to the real because i always thought it's not about that

325
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:33,820
no indeed it's not about that i think we have to understand quite clearly the epistemic ambition

326
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:42,460
or strategic ambitions behind these machines as when they are used in a capitalist context

327
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,020
of course in fact with the advent of big data and machine learning

328
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:59,340
emergencies are detected in real time in a nanomic complex and purely metric digital space purely

329
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:06,300
which is the result of an abstraction but also of all kinds of of production of raw data as you as

330
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:15,100
you said which is compression and so on so but but which is purely metric which is a space which

331
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:23,900
is envisaged that's not from the topological angle of continuity and stability but from the time

332
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:32,700
based angle of contingency instability and continuously recons reconducted crisis

333
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:42,060
as a host exo adams explaining one of his paper so in that context what we have to understand

334
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:50,860
is that data doesn't don't function as as signs there they don't function as signifiers

335
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:59,660
for for something rather they function as pure differences or deferments of meaning

336
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:09,340
that are never given in their completion so to explain that a little bit i have i have to i think

337
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:15,420
go back to a comparison between um what for example adolf ketley

338
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,860
concept or the order between the deterministic metaphysics that for example adolf ketley

339
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,540
heads when founding or participating to the to the foundation of statistics and what happens

340
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:39,660
in machine learning the speculative ambitions of machine learning i think are really at odd

341
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:46,460
with the mid 19th century of ambitions of studying studying social physics like adolf ketley

342
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,100
whose project was to study men in his various degrees of aggregation from the individual state

343
00:40:53,100 --> 00:41:00,220
to the highest state of combination which includes the whole of humanity on the contrary algorithmic

344
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:08,700
governmentality radically embraces uncertainty incommensurability contingency it it also attests

345
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:15,980
to a new mode of preemptive intervention which is no longer legitimated or justified as the ability

346
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:23,660
to act on the basis of precise knowledge of the future but on the contrary as an invincible

347
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:32,300
certainty as to what must be done in the absence of such certainty as martin conings says quite

348
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,740
clearly in capital and time so and the temporalities of course recursive which

349
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:46,780
changed everything so um in fact it's a dynamic mode where continuous learning where continuous

350
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:53,500
learning and production of reliability without truth including truth about people's behaviors

351
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:59,740
replace the production of temporary truth and their justifiability verifiability contestability

352
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:07,340
i would say what relates algorithmic governmentality also to cybernetic is of course the

353
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:14,140
overcoming of the notion that that of the of the separation of calculation and things

354
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:24,220
of of contents and matter and so on it resets a new kind new ontology but which is completely

355
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:31,420
disarticulated from from the notion of of of a human subject

356
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:39,260
so i don't know if it responds to you to your question i'm sure it does somehow definitely

357
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:45,260
um i would be interested because i think you have described a lot of your critique already i would

358
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:53,420
be interested in what you argue for actually so i would be interested in what is your proposition

359
00:42:53,420 --> 00:43:00,060
what would you bring in against algorithmic governmentality well um i i think of course

360
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:10,220
my posture here is more descriptive of something uh which is uh which is which amounts to

361
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:18,860
capitalism on capitalism and neoliberalism realism on algorithmic steroids i know it's

362
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:27,020
not fashionable to say that uh but i think we would need uh maybe a constitutional moment

363
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:34,940
a moment uh well a moment wherein we think about a concept what is a constitution a constitution

364
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:43,100
is a text by which the present the people who are present and who sign the constitution limit

365
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:49,100
their own power they limit their own power they promise a little bit like you know

366
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:58,940
charged nature with that task of producing an animal who can promise and keep its promise

367
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:07,420
constitution does that in fact it it forces those who sign to consider

368
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:16,940
a lot of things which are irreducible to the mere optimization of the current situation or the state

369
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:25,980
of state of facts uh it allow for the consideration uh a political constitution allow for the

370
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:35,820
consideration of those who have not yet left any digital trace that can be enrolled in the calculation

371
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:45,100
of the optimal it means that it allows to preserve the space and time which would not

372
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:53,820
be preoccupied by the bulimic appetites by those who have been granted including by algorithmic

373
00:44:53,820 --> 00:45:00,380
algorithmic systems granted with the force without law which allows them to transform

374
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:08,140
the virtual the not yet there the possibilities into into surplus value

375
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:19,980
so it's it's uh i think we have to find ways to enforce uh new uh a new intelligence of

376
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:28,140
limits a new intelligence of limits because uh this intelligence of limits which life itself

377
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:37,980
has very well as a kangelem has shown us that normativity of life itself but we have to to

378
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:45,100
to to find that there are several kinds of because i'm a lawyer by so i maybe i'm a bit

379
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:52,860
distorted as all lawyers but i'm distorted uh uh and i try to go back to my own discipline you know

380
00:45:52,860 --> 00:46:01,580
as a as a safe island um but we have instruments uh the constitution we have the notion of

381
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:07,340
institution what is an institution it's all that algorithmic governmentality tries to um

382
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:16,940
to render obsolete in fact um the notion of according to david yume uh the role of institutions

383
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:26,700
is in fact to force the agents you me uh elon musk uh donald trump everyone to force people

384
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:36,300
to transcend the partiality of their natural sympathies you know um david yume was not for

385
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:43,660
the social contract because he among other reasons he thought the problem of our society of society

386
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:49,900
is not the egoism of individuals in fact people are not egoistic because they can sacrifice

387
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:56,140
themselves for for the the ones they care for for their children and so on the problem is the

388
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:05,340
partiality of these natural sympathies and only institutions can force people to refrain uh from

389
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:12,860
their uh impulsion or compulsion to optimize that is to to to take the most they can of the present

390
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:19,660
and of the future and of everything that is that is there and only only institution can force them

391
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:27,340
to consider what is not already there for them to consume in fact so we we need that we need that

392
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:34,140
no we need to rethink the role of kind of institutions and but fast because we don't

393
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:45,660
have much time in front of systems in fact that push everyone uh towards self-optimization and

394
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:51,020
consumption of of everything that's what i said at the beginning algorithmic

395
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,860
governmentality is a way of fragmenting all collectives immunizing i would say capitalism

396
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:06,060
against all and every form that should and and would in fact interrupt its flaws that is the

397
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:16,780
world the material world and its limits the social the social the collective it fragments the

398
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:25,020
collective it's a it's a high resolution which is also a high dissolution and life itself in fact

399
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:34,060
life itself with with its own uh negantropic regulations that i i really believe that

400
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:41,580
nick land was right when he said that there is a common teleology between cybernetics and capitalism

401
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:49,180
and that terrible uh teleology is really necropolitic i believe so that that's the

402
00:48:49,180 --> 00:49:02,220
reason why we urgently need to reconcile with the notion that uh anyway we have to invent

403
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,100
the forms including the political forms the institutional forms the constitutional forms

404
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:14,540
which uh institute our life in common and alain supior had it right when he said the

405
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:20,860
anthropologic function of law is to articulate together the different facets of human being

406
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:30,300
these facets being the physiological the symbolic and the social if we agree to translate or to

407
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:39,740
consider that all these different facets or layers are transcriber or reducible into

408
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:49,340
reducible to pure flaws of of digital computable data and that this is enough for us to to to

409
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:57,900
to govern ourselves i think we do a big mistake i think i would have to kind of dig a little

410
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:06,220
deeper into this answer because um i guess it's not as simple as simply reverting back to like

411
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:13,900
the law as it was the uh sovereign as it was the individual as it was so if we want to find

412
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:20,060
answers to this as you frame it kind of assault of algorithmic governmentality then first of all we

413
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:26,220
would have to ask are they the the proper tools in terms of are they adequate for the task and then

414
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,180
of course i think we had we would have to rethink them because i mean they are not innocent in

415
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:37,500
themselves the law is not innocent the the the liberal subject for sure is not innocent and so

416
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:44,220
on so i would like to know at some point maybe this would be a good good example at some point

417
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:52,220
you state that you think that actually we would have to stick with the fictional individual

418
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:58,460
because it's kind of operationable it serves a purpose and that we need this purpose and

419
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:03,580
while knowing that it is a fiction we still need it and i was wondering how far you would go with

420
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:10,060
these things because i think it's kind of a play with fire but maybe positively speaking it's

421
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,660
staying with the trouble in terms of done a hero way but i would be interested um whether or not

422
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,620
we would have to kind of rethink these elements that you bring forward against algorithmic

423
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:27,580
governmentality yes i think my response will be much simpler than your answer

424
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:35,820
i'm afraid but i must state what's a subject for me what's the form subject for me the form subject

425
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:45,260
is the content is void subjects are processes in constant overcoming of themselves subjects are

426
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:51,340
becomeings there are processes of individuation processes of subjectivation and so on so

427
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:59,020
notion of subject is eminently dynamic so i'm not nostalgic at all of the subject conceived as the

428
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:06,540
as the liberalism conceived it as its fundamental unit unitary master of its own intentionality

429
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:12,460
separated from others and so on not at all my notion of the subject is completely different and

430
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:19,820
i have come to consider that the subject the role that the subject plays the subject is a point of

431
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:26,860
view it's nothing else than a point of view so the world needs the subjects because the subject

432
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:34,140
is the point of view from which objects may appear despite their ontological indetermination

433
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:44,620
um as barad and so on uh would say and at the same time subjects need objects because also

434
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:52,460
objects reflect their own position so it's a it's really a notion of the subject as um

435
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:03,420
both as power subject as power of individuation or as a potentiality of individuation has never

436
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:10,060
completely enclosed in any present but it's a process that is lived and experienced and

437
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,980
constructed and deconstructed all the time over time over always over time so my notion of the

438
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:25,020
subject is a heterochronic notion it's absolutely heterochronic that's the reason why uh the uh

439
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:33,340
absorption in in the pure vortex of real time of everything by algorithmic governmentality

440
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:41,180
is absolutely inhuman it's not habitable because we we are we are over time so that notion of the

441
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:48,780
subject i think the subject like an actor it is because i'm a lawyer the notion of person persona

442
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:57,660
person is the mask it's a mask that people put on their face when they have to act uh on a stage

443
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:03,980
on a stage but also on the stage of the of the of a judicial court for example

444
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:14,940
the notion the person is is inseparable from all the kinds of editorializations

445
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:24,460
that we perform all the time but we are we are nothing else we are nothing else than these

446
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:32,220
editorializations there is no subject without a form the form is the subject so that's the reason

447
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:37,980
why the legal subject for example is is a functional fiction it's something that the law needs

448
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:46,940
but it's but but the law knows that it's a fiction it's a place it's a location from which

449
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:55,580
to make one's situation or the situation of the people who share an existential experience of

450
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:04,860
discrimination for example together being a person before the law is being able to give account

451
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:16,540
of injustice felt injustice felt problems to in fact it's a way of mattering and of determining

452
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:24,780
or contributing to the definition of what matters what's a problem and what needs solution so it's

453
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:34,380
quite pragmatic i would say but not only it's not only pragmatic i think it's also in a way ontologic

454
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:40,700
but it's an ontology which is absolutely non-essentialist before asking my last

455
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,860
question i would love to go to a place where we have been today in this workshop already

456
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,980
i'm very much interested in this question of alternative arts of government and there's this

457
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:59,340
famous quote by fukuh which i read out today earlier already and the quote goes what

458
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,820
governmentality is possible as a strictly intrinsically and autonomously socialist

459
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:10,220
governmentality in any case we know only that if there is a really socialist governmentality

460
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:16,460
then it is not hidden within socialism and its texts it cannot be deduced from them it must be

461
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:24,060
invented and quote and as i understand it your critique is a critique of algorithmic governmentality

462
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:30,780
as a techno capitalist governmentality and not all of it will necessarily apply for other uses of

463
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:37,180
these technologies in other contexts so maybe let's turn to the the question of construction again

464
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:43,260
to the question of alternative in a positive sense what could this invention of desirable

465
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:49,900
alternative governmentalities look like well i completely rejoined you when saying that you

466
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:57,500
know and that's the the virtue of problematization is is to avoid technological determinism or you

467
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:07,020
know today technologies are the ideal uh how you say scapegoat all the problems are

468
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:15,340
we project all our problems on technologies it's because of of social networks that democracy is

469
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:23,660
dysfunctional it's because of no no it's much broader than that uh of course so i i think

470
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:31,900
there's no fatality in the fact that these uh technologies today are used in order to

471
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:40,700
to boost uh capitalism and to accelerate uh to accelerate uh towards uh towards apocalysm

472
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:47,180
apocalypse by apocalypse i mean precisely not the end of the world but the the end of the end of

473
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:58,060
capitalism in fact um the smartness the smartness of these technologies is precisely

474
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:06,700
that's uh through big data and machine learning we can become

475
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:16,060
aware we can see regularities of the world which are only observable on on huge numbers

476
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:23,660
so it's a question of scale so in fact what they produce also what they can produce are alternative

477
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:32,060
maps of the world and of events which can be very interesting for i give you an example there are a

478
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:40,780
lot of discussions today about the possibility the legitimacy or the opportunity of using

479
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:49,740
algorithmic systems in in the judicial uh in the judicial system algorithmic decision making

480
00:58:50,620 --> 00:59:00,780
as to help judges for example and so on to take decisions um in fact what would be interesting

481
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:08,540
what is interesting is that big data analytics allow for example to give to to to give to the

482
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:16,140
judges a mirror of how the law functions you know it can give it can give very precious

483
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:23,820
informations about the state of the law as it is practiced what kind of decisions are taken and so

484
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:35,180
on so as a as a we can look at ourselves in big data and it gives us an image a certain image

485
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:41,660
which is not deprived of a point of view because algorithms have point of view

486
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:48,220
uh point the point of view of an algorithm i would say it's its objective function it depends of oh

487
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:54,940
how the algorithm has been constructed and so on it depends on what kind of sensors are used to

488
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:01,260
collect the data what kind of data are considered noise and what kind of data are considered signals

489
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:09,020
and so on so there are point of view but it can allow us to be uh alerted

490
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:17,020
about specificities or singularities of the world that we would not or of our

491
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:24,220
or of our own behaviors that we would not notice otherwise so it can increase our intelligence

492
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:33,100
instead of depriving us from intelligence the risk being of course that we overestimate the

493
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:42,300
objectivity the scientificity of these productions no they are not more scientific not more objective

494
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:48,700
than human judgment it's just that the world is looked at from a different perspective

495
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:54,780
when looked at from the perspective of an algorithm we have to know about all the

496
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:01,420
biases the basis of the humans but the basis of the algorithms as well and there are a lot there

497
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,980
are a lot and and they're difficult to to detect sometimes because for example the distinction

498
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:14,860
between uh what is a signal and what is noise is not decided by an institution in algorithmic

499
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:26,220
governmentality it's it is just uh it is set it is that distinction is set in a in a way which is

500
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:34,860
undergenius to the the socio-mediatic reality so it's evolving all the time so it's quite

501
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:40,700
difficult to know exactly what the point of view of the algorithm is and that's the difficulty

502
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:48,300
that's the difficulty but that difficulty is quite interesting in itself because it it it instills

503
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:56,860
it instills trouble if we are if we keep attentive to these difficulties

504
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,820
so that's the reason why i i don't meditate for algorithmic transparency for example which is

505
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:11,820
it's a complete stupidity from my perspective not only it's unattainable because the the

506
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:19,260
inductive logic is not even easily translatable into into a linear language understandable by

507
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:32,620
the humans but but it would be really attenuating the enchanting alien logic or the enchanting

508
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:41,980
view from somewhere else which we really need in order to to to boost our imagination also so i

509
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:50,940
think it it can if algorithmic systems can de-automatize our own thinking that would be

510
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:58,940
quite great okay in order to have some time for open discussion i will ask my last question

511
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,500
question which is always if you think about the future what makes you joyful

512
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:11,100
that's maybe the hardest one for the moment if i think about the future what makes me

513
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:18,540
joyful i think maybe but i'm not the the first one to say that uh that that impression that

514
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:27,420
the apocalypse has already arisen and that we are what remains i think slavosh dzek said that

515
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:33,100
and i find that a nice logic because you know if you think that the catastrophe the absolute

516
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:41,340
catastrophe has already arisen which is not impossible in fact then we have nothing left

517
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:53,820
to lose you know except that we we now have to organize ourselves to um to become to become

518
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:03,420
human to become human to to stop behaving like inhuman persons and there is much work i think

519
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:12,540
to attain to that non-inhumanity i prefer to speak of non-inhuman uh because it's less

520
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:20,860
segregative than affirming a human essence but i really like that double uh double negation i

521
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:28,220
think it's that double negations are are really uh are really interesting and really dialectical

522
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:36,620
and there may be the core of of of what makes us human that ability you know it's also zizek who

523
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:45,100
said that and i agree with him uh what you know what an artificial intelligence will never never

524
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:52,300
understand is the difference between uh coffee without cream and coffee without milk

525
01:04:54,060 --> 01:05:00,220
but we can we understand there is a difference because we are affected differently by the lack

526
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:07,660
of cream or the lack of milk depending of our tastes um so that's what we have to preserve

527
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:15,980
i think and that's that's that's dialectic that's dialectics and i think uh well that's one thing

528
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:23,420
that makes me happy another thing that makes me happy uh or even joyful is are of course my my

529
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:36,060
kids whom i i find so so intelligent and so marvelous and yes that's it i guess

530
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,540
