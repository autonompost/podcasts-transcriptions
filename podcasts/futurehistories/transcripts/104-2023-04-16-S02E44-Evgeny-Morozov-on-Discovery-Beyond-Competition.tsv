0	5800	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome
5800	8920	Yevgeny Matosov in today's episode.
8920	16120	He is a researcher and writer as well as founder of the knowledge curation platform The Syllabus.
16120	20060	Regular listeners will know that I highly appreciate his work.
20060	25960	Time and time again, Yevgeny succeeds in pushing our thoughts further through his very thorough
25960	28400	research and sharp thinking.
28400	34640	So you can imagine that I was and still am quite excited to have the chance to welcome
34640	36960	him as a guest in Future Histories.
36960	40640	In many ways, this couldn't be more fitting.
40640	46960	And there is an exciting announcement to make related to me and Yevgeny recording this episode
46960	52560	because a transcript of this episode will be featured in an upcoming book I co-edit
52560	55240	together with Christoph Sorg.
55240	61840	It's an edited volume called Creative Construction, Plant Economies in the 21st Century and Beyond
61840	65280	and it will be published with Bristol University Press.
65280	70440	I am absolutely thrilled about the fantastic group of people that are coming together for
70440	72440	this edited volume.
72440	78800	There are contributions by Laura Horn, Jakob Heyer, Samia Mohamed, Nick Dyer-Witherford,
78800	100120	There will be a chapter by Elena Hoferbeth, Matthias Schmelzer and Cedric Durand.
100120	104440	Christoph Sorg will of course provide the chapter as will I myself.
104440	110160	And there will be transcripts of two conversations, one between Nancy Fraser and Christoph Sorg
110160	116000	and one, you guessed it, between Yevgeny Morozov and myself.
116000	121560	I can promise you that this is not the last time you'll hear me be absolutely excited
121560	123100	about this book.
123100	129640	Right now the release is scheduled for May 2024 and be assured I'll keep you updated
129640	130960	on that.
130960	136920	Now that I have so shamelessly indulged in self-promotion for the last few minutes,
136920	141800	let me be equally excited about an upcoming project by Yevgeny.
141800	147880	It's a podcast series written and presented by Yevgeny himself and it's called The Santiago
147880	154660	Boys and it's described as a wild tale of how Salvador Allende's engineers dared to
154660	161820	challenge corporations and spy agencies and almost won a battle for the very soul of
161820	164220	information technology.
164220	170680	You'll find a link to the very stylish website of the Santiago Boys podcast in the show notes.
170680	175740	On the website you'll find a trailer and in order to stay updated until it's released
175740	179540	this summer, you can subscribe to newsletter.
179540	184980	Yevgeny has worked on this podcast series for quite a while now and has already been
184980	191940	an expert on the topic before that so we can all look forward to a surely exciting approach
191940	192940	to the topic.
192940	200260	I for once am thrilled and looking forward to listening to this podcast this summer.
200260	206220	Before we finally start, I would like to welcome Saskia as a patron of future histories and
206220	213660	I'd like to thank Urs, Lukas, Wilfried, Fabian, Georg and Karl for their kind donations.
213660	226540	And now please enjoy today's episode with Yevgeny Matosov on Discovery Beyond Competition.
226540	227540	Welcome Yevgeny.
227540	229500	Glad to be here.
229500	234860	There's a lecture you gave at Berkeley titled Beyond Competition, Alternative Discovery
234860	240700	Procedures and the Post-Capitalist Public Sphere and you start the lecture by hinting
240700	246500	towards the, and I quote you here, inability of the left to make sense of digital technologies
246500	252000	and what to do with them and then you continue that in your view the left has a problem with
252000	257280	making sense of its own project and related to that you ask, and I quote you again, what
257280	261820	should their future be other than just defending the welfare state and insisting that they
261820	265200	can humanize capitalism, end quote.
265200	271020	So I'm of course very much interested in both of these tasks, making sense of a possible
271020	276020	broader project of the left as well as making sense of the role of digital technologies
276020	277820	for such a project.
277820	283180	What are the main challenges surrounding both of these tasks and how are they related to
283180	284420	each other?
284420	291180	Well, it's a lot to bite, so I'm not sure how we're going to tackle it.
291180	297260	So probably these issues will pop up as we speak, but so that lecture I think was almost
297260	298940	two years ago that I gave it.
298940	304460	So I think, you know, my thinking always evolves and it probably has evolved since then.
304460	310620	I haven't gotten back to celebrating the left as the kind of the source of forward progressive
310620	314300	thinking on matters of technology, so that hasn't changed.
314300	320040	But to answer your question, I think let's try to tackle them separately.
320040	324640	Let's first tackle some of the problems of the left and then we can talk about technology
324640	331640	because I think ultimately the reason why the left has not been able to come up with
331640	338960	a more exciting plan for how to use technology and technologies is because it kind of got
338960	347900	stuck in a certain intellectual, political trap, if you will.
347900	352140	So before we get it out of that trap, I don't think that any forward thinking about technology
352140	353260	would emerge.
353260	359400	So do you want me to, I mean, like I can go on.
359400	360400	Yes, of course.
360400	362600	You know, like do you really want me to try to lay it out?
362600	363760	Yes, of course.
363760	364760	That's why I'm asking.
364760	368400	No, no, because it's a huge question.
368400	372540	I mean, it's a question about which you can borrow the right 10 books and you can have
372540	377440	an entire book imprint of Verso books dedicated just to that question.
377440	386020	So fine, let me start because it's so abstract that I feel like I might not land if I jump
386020	387020	off that plane.
387020	388020	You can try.
388020	389020	Fine.
389020	393100	So let me try to outline it.
393100	400340	So traditionally, I think the left has inherited this idea, or at least the radical left that's
401120	410280	liberal Keynesian left has inherited this idea that somehow its task is to figure out
410280	421120	how to deploy the tools of planning and all the associated knowledge techniques and repertoires
421260	431940	in order to show that the market does a suboptimal job at allocating resources.
431940	432940	Right.
432940	438740	So the project of the left has been essentially, and again, I'm not talking about Keynesians.
438740	442500	I'm talking about kind of hardcore left.
442500	448340	The project has been to show that you can build alternative rationalities of allocating
448400	454800	goods and resources that would beat the rationality of the market.
454800	462360	And to some extent, you know, it has been done with various success in places like the
462360	470320	Soviet Union, partially, of course, by relying on all sorts of techniques like input output
470320	472680	methods and whatnot.
473660	482820	The temptation within that tradition, of course, is to think that now that we have more tools
482820	490340	and techniques of organizing knowledge, including those of big data and artificial intelligence,
490340	499100	we should essentially try to recover that focus on allocating goods and resources and
499160	506040	turbocharge it essentially with these new techniques and to show and prove to the liberal,
506040	513400	to the neoliberals, if you will, who have shifted this debate into this knowledge-intensive
513400	518760	dimension thanks to people like Hayek and before he meets us.
518760	523960	And the objective is to show them that essentially they got it wrong, that market is suboptimal
524140	526180	and that there is a better way to do it.
526180	534260	And we can have a better allocative rationality if you want to put it that way.
534260	545460	This is what I think is what some of the most tech-friendly leftists imagine the task of
545460	548620	the left to be.
548620	563200	I, for one, remain skeptical that this task should retain the focus that it has retained
563200	565960	within that cohort.
565960	569200	I don't even think that it's a mainstream focus of the left, to be honest.
569200	578440	I think that the left that has not opted for Keynesianism has opted for some kind of Hayekian
578440	582640	view that markets are better at organizing knowledge and that maybe we should just focus
582640	585640	on somehow cleaning up afterwards.
585640	591560	And the left that is still thinking about something that goes beyond the market or some
591560	602520	kind of Keynesian multiplier is trying to recover and improve and turbocharge the toolkit
602520	603960	of Soviet planning.
604960	609840	Me, I've been thinking about these issues for quite a few years now and the conclusion
609840	613880	I've reached, which I don't think I'm going to lay out in full in this conversation because
613880	619320	I'm still working on finishing a book, I've started on this, so it's kind of thinking
619320	620720	in progress.
620720	626920	Even though I know the answer, I will keep the suspense and not give you what I really
626920	628400	think about all of these issues.
628840	633680	Ultimately, the conclusion I've reached is that there is so much more for the left to
633680	642360	do with this technologist if only it slightly tweaks the initial question with which it
642360	644480	starts this operation.
644480	649240	And the question with which it starts this operation now, I think, is still primarily
649240	655160	focused on how do we satisfy human needs and the needs that are basic.
655160	657060	How do we make sure that people get fat?
657060	660740	How do we make sure that people get enough adequate housing?
660740	664580	How do we make sure that all of these basic needs are satisfied?
664580	668100	There is, of course, a huge debate on the left.
668100	669660	How do you count needs?
669660	671500	How do you quantify them?
671500	672860	How do you qualify them?
672860	673860	Are they trans-historical?
673860	674860	Are they permanent?
674860	677060	Do they change?
677060	680900	That's a whole debate of its own and I don't want to take any position in that debate in
680900	682620	this conversation.
682620	690860	But ultimately, I think as long as you retain your focus within this needs paradigm, if
690860	697100	you will, you are not going to ask truly exciting questions that will allow you as a leftist
697100	702740	to win over the neoliberal camp and their vision of the market.
702740	709300	Because their vision of the market is no longer about allocation of goods as it was at the
709460	716220	beginning of this debate, which some of us and people on your podcast would know it probably
716220	721180	already fairly well, which is the big event that starts it as the so-called socialist
721180	728340	calculation debate, where the discussion is primarily about which of the two systems does
728340	734580	a better job of satisfying the needs of the populace, whether it's the market or whether
734580	736860	it's the plan.
736860	741540	I don't think that the neoliberals are still arguing about needs, even though the leftists
741540	743540	still are arguing about needs.
743540	749060	For neoliberals of the most sophisticated kind, the market became something else entirely.
749060	755780	It's a way of organizing the journey into the unknown, as Hayek writes about competition
755780	757340	in one instance.
757340	764460	It's a way of assuming and allowing more complexity into our social affairs.
764460	769820	For someone like James Buchanan, it's even an instrument of becoming and allowing people
769820	773780	to discover who they really are and who they want to be.
773780	778380	It's no longer about satisfying basic needs.
778380	784660	This I would argue is what accounts for the buy-in and legitimacy of the market as a tool
784660	786940	of organizing society.
786940	793340	Because for the more sophisticated end of the neoliberal debate, markets are not tools
793340	794940	of organizing economies.
794940	800780	They are infrastructures of organizing civilization.
800780	808900	As long as the left doesn't present an equally powerful vision of its infrastructure for
808900	817940	organizing civilization and not just allocating raincoats and beds, it will never be able
817940	821940	to defeat neoliberalism, at least ideationally.
821940	822940	This is the background.
822940	826540	We can jump into any of these points, but this is sort of how I see it.
826540	834140	I didn't yet give you any hint, at least in these remarks, as to what this alternative
834140	836300	project of the left might be.
836300	843060	But I do think that the fight that the left is fighting, it has no opponent because the
843060	848660	neoliberals have moved on and so has probably the general public.
848660	855020	Much of this discussion about how you can satisfy basic needs using AI and Walmart and
855020	862420	Amazon-like planning, it's a debate that I'm not sure anybody on the right, of the sophisticated
862420	868980	neoliberals who have engaged with socialist calculation debate, even needs to hear.
868980	872560	Because these people, if you read them, if you read even somebody like Buchanan writing
872560	878460	about computers in the early 1990s, he will tell you point blank, yeah, sure, computers
878460	885100	can maybe arrive at a perfectly planned economy, but computers will still not give you the
885100	892900	possibility of exploring who you truly are and of unearthing this becoming and discovery
892900	895540	element that the market does.
895540	898340	And this is why socialism will never win.
898340	900820	I mean, this is their argument.
900820	906940	But what I'm saying is that the answer of the left with regards to big tech and AI and
906980	912700	cloud computing and infrastructures has to provide an answer to that critique and not
912700	920380	just to the critique of, well, we can allocate rain codes better by using Amazon-like warehouses
920380	921740	methods.
921740	926060	That to me, it's not that relevant.
926060	934340	Okay, maybe let's try to pick this apart a bit because I'm wondering to what degree we're
934340	940540	talking about a successful myth, so to speak, a narrative on the part of the neoliberals
940540	947300	and to what degree we're talking about an actual ability to bring about something new.
947300	952340	Because depending on what we're talking about, we have to address or we might have to bring
952340	956740	up different alternative solutions.
956740	962460	Because I'm to a certain degree wondering why we should accept this Hayekian myth as
962540	968460	a starting point in the first place, since it's so extremely narrow and somewhat kind
968460	973580	of easy to disprove, I would say, by pointing to the many inventions that are not really
973580	978700	based on monetary incentives and market competition, et cetera.
978700	984180	And when it comes to the public imaginary, for example, it seems that non-market based
984180	991180	discovery is somewhat firmly being recognized within a broader public imagination as well,
991180	992180	I would say.
992260	998020	The stereotype inventor in novels, films, and comics, et cetera, used to be more of
998020	1005040	a intrinsically motivated nerd figure and not the business type who primarily seeks
1005040	1006040	profit.
1006040	1012460	And I would say that this business type in the liberal version of things only comes into
1012460	1018780	the picture afterwards when the invention kind of has to be brought to the market, so
1018780	1019780	to speak.
1020660	1025260	But if this is the case, but if discovery is not really the problem because we have
1025260	1032860	these intrinsically motivated nerd types, then this would mean that what we need most
1032860	1038580	is not so much a new mechanism for the discovery of things, but an alternative mode or alternative
1038580	1044700	modes of allocating funds and democratizing investment, et cetera, in order to then bring
1044860	1051380	about effectively the huge potential for the new, so to speak, that seems to be a somewhat
1051380	1055180	inherent feature of human potential.
1055180	1061420	And on a worldwide scale, for example, this potential is extremely untapped since, for
1061420	1068260	example, venture capital has a extreme bias with regard to flowing money to their own
1068260	1071340	kind regardless of actual ability.
1071340	1073740	So I would be interested.
1073740	1080860	Is it a narrative that we are combating in this case, or is it an actual ability of market
1080860	1083660	competition to really bring about the new?
1083660	1089860	I mean, you're framing it in a certain way, and I'm not sure that these are the only
1089860	1098260	options in this debate, meaning that I understand what you're saying, but I don't think that
1098260	1105140	the focus on invention is necessarily the correct one, because the whole point of linking
1105140	1109860	it and lumping it with becoming is that you can also account for the consumer side of
1109860	1112620	things and not just for the inventor side of things.
1112620	1116980	So on the consumer side of things, the argument that neoliberals would make is that having
1116980	1123140	the market as the infrastructure of modernity is what precisely allows you to discover what
1123180	1128020	you really want, to express your needs and to eventually have them satisfied in a way
1128020	1131860	that has not been done before, because these needs were not even in your head.
1131860	1135820	So you can, of course, argue that there are all sorts of ways to do it differently.
1135820	1137220	And of course, there are.
1137220	1143820	I'm just saying that it's not just the story of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur
1143820	1145700	inventing something in the garage.
1145700	1148540	I mean, there are bigger things at stake here.
1148540	1157060	I think with regards to the story told by neoliberals, if you account for both the consumption
1157060	1163300	side and the production side, and if you account also for a very important element of it, which
1163300	1168900	is scale, because ultimately the story that somebody like Hayek would tell you is that,
1168900	1173380	sure, you can have solidarity and altruism in a small community in a village where everybody
1173380	1177340	knows each other, but as you start scaling things up and you have urbanization and
1177340	1181740	modernization, it becomes very hard to scale this stuff.
1181740	1186340	So the additional factor in the neoliberal story, of course, is the process of modernization
1186340	1194940	that, yes, you have what Hayek would say the cash nexus that now penetrates and intermediates
1194940	1198580	everything in a way that wasn't there before.
1198580	1205020	But it brings with it certain benefits of which this ability to live in a modern world
1205020	1209220	where things are discovered and where there is new that's produced by the behavior of
1209220	1213780	both consumers and entrepreneurs, it's there.
1213780	1218660	Do I think this story is partly accurate?
1218660	1219660	Yes.
1219660	1225780	Do I think that's the only way in which you can account for different alternatives to
1225780	1231940	different possibilities of becoming and discovery and scaling up the process of modernization
1231940	1233700	in a way that bypasses the market?
1233700	1235860	Of course, I think it's possible.
1235860	1241980	But the way I think to go about it is not to dismiss the story told by the neoliberals,
1241980	1246940	is to instead to historicize it and to say that, look, guys, you have a story that emerges
1246940	1248860	from the Cold War.
1248860	1253180	You set up your two punching bags or your punch one punching bag in this case, which
1253180	1259060	was the state or the central state and sort of Keynesian liberals play the supporting
1259060	1265820	Castro every now and then because you could always pick them, pick on them and say, look,
1265820	1271500	these guys are almost communists, so you can let them play with their monetary policy.
1271500	1275660	And if you let them play with government spending, eventually we'll all be like the Soviet Union.
1275660	1280620	So it's kind of one and a half punching bags, if you really want to be accurate.
1280620	1282540	But why are they the only options?
1283020	1291980	And this is where you really start understanding that you can have a more sophisticated type
1291980	1298420	of society, so you can have more complexity, you can have more social coordination among
1298420	1302820	people and actors and institutions that were not in touch before.
1302820	1308300	That doesn't at all require any mediation by the price mechanism and the price system,
1308380	1314740	because if the argument made by the neoliberals is that essentially you need the price system
1314740	1320740	so that people can come together and start coordinating things and coordinating their
1320740	1324620	needs and understanding what's available, what's not available.
1324620	1326380	Why not just do it directly?
1326380	1330220	And if you can do it directly, and we do that actually all the time, we do that actually
1330220	1335300	in families, you know, when you need to coordinate with your spouse or partner about picking
1335300	1340340	up kids from a kindergarten, you don't organize an auction and you don't appeal to intellectual
1340340	1344260	property rights and you don't create a market and that behavior, you just send a message
1344260	1349660	over WhatsApp or any other type of infrastructure and you basically coordinate how to make something
1349660	1356820	happen that before that was just a virtuality or was just a hypothetical possibility and
1356820	1361140	with some basic information exchange, it becomes a reality and an actuality, right?
1361140	1368620	It happens all the time and that should prompt some questions in our mind as to what are
1368620	1374060	the prerequisites and possibilities for scaling this up and making them richer and making
1374060	1379940	sure that the types of social coordination that are possible in the market are also possible
1379940	1385940	in other domains of life and maybe they need the funding and the infrastructures and the
1385940	1389780	kind of risk-free environments in which to develop.
1389780	1394380	But this is what I think needs to be essentially, this is the argument that needs to be used
1394380	1395660	against neoliberals.
1395660	1401740	It's not to say that the market doesn't do it, but what I think we should do is to essentially
1401740	1407380	accept it and say, yes, the market does it, but it does it with huge costs, first of all,
1407380	1413020	and these costs are not fully accounted for by the neoliberals themselves, very often,
1413020	1414900	and it's not the only way to do it.
1414900	1421900	And the organizing religious myth at the core of neoliberalism is that you only have two
1421900	1425900	options, the market and the state, and there is nothing else in the twin, and if you don't
1425900	1431540	do the market, you'll eventually end up in Gulag, and that's just not the story, right?
1431540	1435700	And then, of course, you have all sorts of perversions, yes, you can have Elon Musk taking
1435700	1440140	a lot of money from the government and blah, blah, blah, but ultimately, you're never going
1440140	1445700	to win that rhetorical fight, because I think broadly, the story, with a few bad exceptions
1445700	1451420	that receive a lot of bad press, the story told by neoliberals, to some extent, is partially
1451420	1452420	correct.
1452420	1457420	Yes, you can have a bunch of small entrepreneurs who essentially don't really, who can treat
1457420	1462700	everything as a black box, because the market system and the price system allows them to,
1462700	1468420	they don't need to know why there is an earthquake in Sri Lanka or why there is suddenly a bunch
1468540	1473700	of refugees landing and driving up the prices of shelter accommodation, they don't care
1473700	1478340	why, they just need to know where the price will be moving, and since the price will be
1478340	1483340	moving, they can take action and other counterparts can take other action, and yes, you can run
1483340	1488740	society as a black box, and by running it as a black box, you can essentially coordinate
1488740	1495180	effectively with all sorts of, to use in your classical economics, externalities, and do
1495180	1499020	we really need them, and maybe we don't, and if we don't need them, then the question
1499020	1506140	becomes what other alternatives and possibilities and infrastructures of social coordination,
1506140	1507900	discovery and becoming do we need?
1507900	1513820	Once you pose the question that way, then you really need to have a good answer as to
1513820	1520540	why that program should be a priority and not the program of satisfying basic needs
1520540	1523660	by giving everybody a coat and a bad bank.
1526540	1531580	Okay, so I guess now the obvious question is what are the mechanisms, Elkeny?
1532380	1536940	What are the mechanisms, the infrastructures, etc., that we need to bring about in order
1536940	1543100	to provide for this type of coordination that is able to also be attractive as an alternative
1543100	1547900	and also, of course, function at this level of abstraction that you are describing?
1547900	1550700	The question should be why, like why do you want to do that?
1551740	1556380	Because I think it's a big question, because if, what is the goal?
1556380	1560540	The goal, one goal might be because you want to generate alternative ways of,
1561180	1564700	you want to create alternative ways of generating value, right?
1564700	1570380	Or kind of socialist value that's not capitalist, and you think that you would be able to somehow
1570460	1579500	have people who engage in social coordination with each other, whose social being, if you will,
1579500	1586220	is productive, but in a non-capitalist way of something that can then be valorized by
1586220	1591980	society as such, and that be used for satisfying the very basic human needs
1591980	1594460	that they're now satisfying through the market, right?
1595340	1602620	So that would point towards a more, I don't want to say,
1602620	1610140	economistic, but a very, let's say, social reproduction-like rationale, right?
1610140	1612780	So you want to, because unless you pose the question why,
1614220	1617100	I think you're not going to get a very solid answer.
1617100	1621820	That alternative might be because we think that by facilitating all these
1622460	1629180	ways of engagement, collaboration, coordination, and so forth, we are advancing society forward,
1629180	1633580	and we believe in progress because we are progressive, so some of us are,
1633580	1637820	and we think that it will result in a society that will be many steps
1637820	1645500	above where it was before because you would be able to cure cancer or avoid the next COVID,
1645500	1650860	and so forth. This is a somewhat different argument for why that needs to be done,
1650860	1656140	and you can have even other arguments by saying that, well, we think that people should have
1656140	1661340	the capacity to form whatever groups and communities they want and pursue whatever
1661340	1666700	styles of life they want, and we should facilitate that, and part of facilitating that would be
1666700	1672620	providing them with the infrastructure and some kind of opportunities to engage in those different
1672620	1678220	life forms and lifestyles and to pursue them at scale, which to me would be yet a different
1678220	1683900	reason, which would require a somewhat different set of interventions, and to some extent,
1685100	1691900	in neoliberal thought, even though they don't do it a very thorough job of explicating that,
1691900	1697420	the market serves all these functions. It's an allocative device because it allocates goods,
1697420	1705180	however imperfectly. It's a device and an infrastructure of seeking and allowing for
1705180	1710700	greater complexity of social interaction, and it's a device which, for better or worse,
1710700	1716380	allows people to withdraw, if you will, and form their own communities and live as they will,
1716380	1721500	with all sorts of constraints and restraints. There are probably many other functions,
1721500	1724460	and I think that when people on the left are posing this question,
1726380	1732060	they need to understand what part of it they are trying to address. Maybe they want to address
1732060	1739180	all three or four, but I'm not going to give you an answer that from the get-go is going to
1739180	1747180	solve all these problems. All I can tell you is that it seems obvious to me that the basic
1747180	1755100	story accepted by the neoliberals, but also by many people on the left, that the choice between
1755100	1761100	more market or more state is incorrect. There are plenty of ways we coordinate,
1761580	1766460	and you don't even need to look at the examples I gave with parents and spouses coordinating over
1766460	1773740	WhatsApp. If you look at a basic school, there is a lot of complexity because there are a lot of
1774380	1781820	pupils and students and teachers and rooms, and that problem of complexity is solved with a very
1781820	1787980	simple device called the timetable, which, as far as I'm concerned, is neither an example of the
1787980	1793020	market nor an example of the state. It's essentially a part of tech infrastructure
1793020	1799500	that greatly reduces complexity and allows for social coordination when none was possible before.
1799500	1804460	We have hundreds of such devices in everyday life, and we have maybe even thousands of them,
1804460	1811180	and the question then is can we have more? Yes. Can we be more advanced? Yes. Would our life
1811820	1817420	be more complex, more interesting, more sophisticated, and not depend on the market
1817420	1823020	if we had more and if they were more advanced? Yes. Once you answer yes to all of that,
1823020	1827980	then you can start asking questions about how our broader tech infrastructure should look like,
1827980	1833100	what legal facets should it have, what property regime should govern it, how much money should
1833100	1839340	be put into it. These are the kind of questions I would be asking. To be asking a question of
1839340	1846620	what should replace it in the abstract, to me, doesn't make a lot of sense without first posing
1846620	1852940	the questions about why, for whom, and with what purpose. You already mentioned different functions
1852940	1859980	of what markets supposedly can do. What are the functions that you think that should be replaced?
1859980	1865580	I think you already hinted towards that maybe all of them could be replaced, but what are the ones
1865580	1871420	that we should pick up first? And what then are the concrete infrastructures, the concrete
1872780	1879340	modes of engagement that we can develop in order to bring about alternative mechanisms? Maybe you
1879340	1885100	could give us examples for alternatives that go beyond the timetable that we already know,
1885100	1892380	but maybe a hint towards examples that, for example, can be scaled in different forms in
1892380	1900460	order to provide modes of engagement that are able to replace certain functions of the market.
1901020	1905580	Maybe you could guide us through different aspects of this.
1906620	1913100	Sure. Look, from the three functions of the market I've outlined and mentioned,
1913100	1920220	it's obvious to me that I am that opposed to making the market the overall infrastructure
1920220	1926220	of modernity, if you will. So I don't want the market to be the tool through which we
1926220	1933660	move and advance forward. I think it's a completely mad bet to do it this way. So clearly,
1933660	1941100	markets should not be instruments of reducing complexity, of organizing different types of
1941100	1948460	coordination among social groups, of allowing new things to be discovered in a structured way.
1948460	1956700	Now, am I against markets as allocative devices in certain limited cases? No, I'm not. I think
1956700	1964220	markets, once they are well-designed and once they are supervised, controlled, and
1965420	1971100	monitored, they can deliver. And you know what to expect of them once you know what to expect of
1971100	1976220	them. And once you monitor for how well they're functioning, you can have them all you want.
1976700	1988300	With this very limited, if you will, focus, this very limited agenda. Now, beyond that,
1991580	1994780	I don't have the great technocratic
1997420	2001500	vision, because I don't think that division here should be technocratic. I think it should be
2001500	2011180	managerial. And this is kind of another dimension that I didn't really make clear in my previous
2011180	2019740	essays, which I will make clear in the book. So I think of traditional socialist in the European
2019740	2025580	sense of the world at least, and the kind of European, traditional European social democratic
2026300	2032300	movement, socialism, this workers movement and communism as well. I think of it as a movement
2032300	2041180	that in the economic sphere seeks simplicity. And planning is one way to get at it. So you
2041180	2049180	really want to make sure that things are under control and that you kind of know what goes where
2049180	2055500	and control the inputs, you can monitor the outputs. It's a system that you might think is
2055500	2061180	complex, but you're trying to make it simple. And you're using all sorts of tools, technologies,
2061180	2070220	techniques of knowledge and so forth to arrive at that simplicity. Capitalists, even Keynesians,
2071660	2079100	don't have this view. They accept by and large that the system is complex. And they think that
2079100	2088700	you can find ways to strive in the complexity. Corporations do that by essentially hiring
2088700	2095660	managers who go through, I mean, I know everybody, people think corporations are under idiots. I
2095660	2102460	don't. I think that good management is a craft and you have to learn it. And it requires all
2102460	2109420	sorts of techniques. I mean, try building a complex tunnel somewhere if you do it. I mean,
2109420	2112860	of course the government does it too. That's not the point I'm making. All I'm trying to say is
2112860	2121260	that something like project management requires a certain skill set, which you develop and then you
2121260	2130460	deal with complexity. But you deal with complexity without trying to make it simple by reducing it
2130460	2137660	into chunks that your system can digest, which I think is the default socialist temptation.
2139020	2145580	So whatever alternative system you would be building, I would suggest it becomes much more
2146300	2154780	managerial in its outlook than whatever the other equivalent was this insistence on simplicity is
2154780	2160540	and would be. And that means that the infrastructures we would need would need
2160540	2168140	to make it easier to manage things. So it might need infrastructures of prediction, of modeling,
2168140	2173820	of running simulations, of understanding how the world might be, because that's what managers do.
2173820	2180300	They try to anticipate the world as complex as it is without making it simpler. And I would
2180300	2184700	argue that the socialists have to go even further than that. They have to deliberately
2184700	2191020	make it more complex. So they have to take it upon themselves to make sure that the world is messier,
2191020	2197980	more chaotic and crazier than it is before they started working. I mean, many socialists succeed
2197980	2203020	in that just because of bad management. But I would argue that that has to be done structurally.
2203020	2209020	And this is what socialism is about. It's about allowing people who want to live in ways that they
2209020	2215660	want outside of the market, outside of whatever mentality and subjectivity is imposed on them by
2215660	2221980	this invisible Leviathan, as some people call the market, to pursue their projects without hopefully
2221980	2231500	hurting each other, but in a way that allows us to have all this immense variety of behaviors,
2231500	2238060	lifestyles, forms of lives, however you want to call it. And still making sure that the ship doesn't
2238060	2243660	think and making sure that the ship doesn't think is what really makes it complex. But this is really
2243660	2252780	where technology, big data and everything else can help, but not help by planning in the old
2253740	2261580	sense of the world, but predicting and managing and then delegating the functions farther down
2261580	2269580	the line so that you don't have to centralize all the management in the hands of the Politburo.
2269580	2277020	Now, this is how it works in the abstract. I'm not naive enough to think that in today's geopolitical
2277020	2285020	milieu, you can have as much decentralization as I would wish personally, because even developing
2285020	2290700	all these infrastructures of prediction, anticipation and management would require the pursuit of
2291820	2297180	probably a far more autonomous technology and science policy that
2299660	2307740	hegemonic powers of today would be happy with. So it will be a trade-off. So I'm not naively
2307740	2313420	proposing that we just have a bunch of communes interrelated with each other through a giant
2313420	2320620	network, but I think as a kind of as a horizon of where we want to be, that's not a bad vision.
2321820	2328060	In preparation for our conversation today, I listened to all of the six
2328860	2335180	Macy lectures by Stafford P. on designing freedom, and a lot of what you just said
2335180	2339900	kind of resonates with some of the ideas that we know from the work of Stafford P.
2339900	2347020	And I would like to kind of make a link to that, because when it comes to examples for
2347020	2352460	large-scale techno-political infrastructures from the left that have tried to provide alternatives
2352460	2359260	to both capitalist market economies and hierarchical central planning, one particular historical
2359260	2365500	experiment, of course, sticks out in different ways, and that is Project CyberSyn. You've worked
2365500	2372460	on the topic extensively in different formats, among them a soon-to-be-released podcast series
2372460	2379260	that I very much look forward to hearing. I guess many of the future history's listeners know about
2379260	2385660	Project CyberSyn, but some might not. So could you for a start give us an overview of what Project
2385660	2392460	CyberSyn is, and then go into how it is relevant for your thinking about alternatives today?
2392460	2402300	It's a good question. I don't think, well, I mean, I'm going to disappoint you.
2402300	2403260	What?
2403260	2413260	So I don't think that Project CyberSyn itself is necessarily very relevant, because essentially,
2413980	2419500	I mean, if you really want to be honest historically, you have to take it for what it was.
2419500	2426380	And what it was, was a system that would allow a ministry, essentially, or a state-run
2426380	2433020	state corporation to run a bunch of companies that were being nationalized in a way that would be
2433020	2441020	scalable. So that's all it was. And it wasn't some great insight that we need to move from
2441580	2448460	central planning to managerialism of the kind I was describing. It was just the circumstances
2448460	2453180	were like that. They couldn't move to central planning, even if they wanted to, and they couldn't
2453180	2457900	exit the market because of the political conjuncture on the ground in Chile. So they were stuck with
2457900	2464620	these companies buying and selling things on the market, but being state companies that needed to
2464620	2472220	be managed in a way that would soon involve the workers, and nobody really knew how exactly that
2472220	2481100	would happen. So this is CyberSyn. This doesn't mean that the ideas circulating in that milieu
2483740	2489180	don't have anything to recommend us. I think they do. Not necessarily ideas about cybernetics,
2489180	2494220	but ideas about technological dependence and the way in which technology plays a
2494220	2499260	certain role in geopolitical order. And this is actually the focus of my Morrison work,
2499260	2508060	looking at Chile and, to some extent, Brazil of the 60s and 70s. But in Stafford Beer himself,
2509180	2518700	there are many elements that are interesting and that I think can and should be integrated
2519820	2526940	with a certain type of socialism. But it's a certain type of socialism that I think itself
2526940	2534140	is in a minority position. And it's a socialism that really looks at
2536940	2547420	complexity as a good thing. And it tries to embrace non-neoliberal complexity
2548780	2555580	and live with it and profit from it. And I would say that people like Raymond Williams, for example,
2555580	2561260	who is one of the people who has actually written about complexity in socialism and how socialists
2561260	2570460	shouldn't system complexity, is somebody who could have had a very interesting engagement
2571260	2575900	with cybernetics. And to some extent, he did. He was a theorist of communication and transport,
2575900	2579420	in addition to being a socialist and transportation. Well, more communication, of course,
2579420	2588300	much more than transportation and culture. But having studied Stafford Beer very closely,
2588300	2593020	having spoken to many of his friends and colleagues and family and having spent a lot of time in his
2593020	2603020	archives, I also don't want to overstate the case. He was a management theorist who mostly, by luck
2603100	2609340	and misfortune, probably more than luck, and for him ended up working in Chile of Allende,
2610060	2617260	and that changed his life. But it was not a conscious effort to think through for a decade
2617260	2625340	of how do we rebuild socialism through cybernetics. That wasn't it. It doesn't mean that there weren't
2625340	2630460	other people who have tried to think this question, and there have been some. But Stafford Beer is
2630460	2638140	essentially a person who is a management theorist. And it doesn't mean that you cannot apply his
2638140	2645500	management theory to other domains. And I think that's what happened in Chile. He had a fan club
2645500	2649900	and they reached out to him. But even if they did not reach out to him, they would be pursuing
2649900	2654940	his ideas in government there, I'm absolutely sure. So it's a body of thought that you can apply
2655900	2659740	in domains that have nothing to do with corporations.
2661100	2667820	And I think this is the part of cybernetics that remains relevant. And I was just reading
2667820	2673100	a project management book the other day. I'm sorry, I'm reading really advanced project management
2673100	2679980	books in search for some deeper truth. And they almost use the same language. They talk about
2679980	2685340	variability and they need to control variability where Stafford Beer would be talking about
2685340	2690540	variety reduction and things like that. So I think a lot of this man, they talk about buffering.
2690540	2699340	I mean, it's all very cybernetic in its outlook. So from that end, I think for obvious reasons,
2699340	2705900	the legacy of people like Stafford Beer lives on in the business world. Partly because,
2705900	2710460	and this is where I think maybe I agree with what you said before, partly because
2712780	2718940	socialist praxis of management and administration hasn't really flourished, even though there have
2718940	2724220	been efforts. I don't know if you know what Stefano Harni was doing with Queen Mary University in
2724220	2729340	London, maybe 10 or 15 years ago. There was an effort to actually take over a business school
2730300	2737100	and reorient it towards leftist Italian autonomous principles. So this efforts have
2737100	2740940	occurred. And sorry, maybe I shouldn't have seen you last Stefano Harni. I don't know if he'll now
2740940	2747260	be hunted down somewhere if he's in Singapore or wherever he is. But essentially,
2749820	2757820	yeah, the socialist praxis has not had a chance to learn from it in part because
2758540	2765500	there has been a shortage of socialist regimes that would truly benefit from it.
2768780	2774700	Because part of Beer's agenda, if you read those lectures carefully and if you read his books
2774700	2780380	carefully, is of course, sorry, should I get controversial and start talking religion?
2780380	2785820	It's almost like the principle of subsidiarity in Catholicism, where you could basically delegate
2785820	2793820	and you want this individual social bodies and units of society to deal with their own problems
2793820	2798460	as much as they can before you involve the church and the state, especially the state.
2800620	2804860	Stafford moved between different religions and eventually he left all of them. But at some point,
2804860	2811020	he was really profoundly Catholic. And I think it partly reflects how he ended up thinking about
2811020	2815340	autonomy because for him, autonomy inside a company, it's that it's making sure that you
2815340	2822380	have these units that are on their own and buying their own business and the higher ups intervene
2822380	2829500	only when something goes wrong. And of course, it has all sorts of issues with it. And it's,
2829500	2835500	one can say it is an appealing vision of how you can organize society in a kind of non-statist form.
2835980	2843180	It's just that the kind of socialists that survived the onslaught of global capitalism against them
2843180	2849100	in the last 30 or 40 years have not been decentralized, but rather if you look at China,
2849100	2856860	they have been centralized. And one can as well argue that had Stafford's ideas in Chile about
2856860	2864060	decentralization and autonomy been implemented faster and sooner, it would have crumbled even
2864140	2868620	earlier than three years in the regime of Allende, in part because
2871100	2877100	it would be very hard for such a regime to survive longer than it did without either
2877100	2883180	mobilizing all the power that you have. And instead of talking about democracy, giving
2884540	2889820	ordinary people arms, which would have led to a Guatemala-like civil war with
2889820	2895580	hundreds of thousands of people dead, or you just forget about all the decentralization and
2895580	2901180	autonomy altogether and you just have a China-style centralized regime and you don't have all the
2901180	2906220	benefits of participatory democracy, but maybe you'll last longer than three years when you
2906220	2913580	avoid the coup. So I think we have to be also a bit historically conscious and pragmatic about
2913580	2919180	this question. But what does this then mean for the alternative that you are thinking about?
2919180	2925580	Because both in terms of this relationship between center and centralized and decentralized
2925580	2934780	elements, as well as with regard to the real challenge of not getting crushed,
2935500	2940860	as you just described it. So what does this mean for the project that you're imagining?
2941980	2946620	Sure. But I think I made it clear in my initial remarks that the kind of project and vision would
2946620	2953340	require, for it to survive, it would require still a much more centralized, central entity
2953340	2959580	with a very robust science and technology policy, with a very robust intelligence network, with a
2959580	2967500	very robust geopolitical outlook, alliances and so forth, to survive in order to pursue those reforms
2967500	2975020	and to pursue this project. About that, I have zero doubt I have about that. Still, I do think
2975020	2981020	that this utopian vision does need to be communicated and put at the center of the discussion,
2981020	2989820	because ultimately, I don't think that you can win over the population, at least in Western Europe
2989820	2998620	and North America, and some parts of Latin America, maybe, with the old socialist ideas,
2998620	3006140	and all socialists are kind of imaginary. And without having those people on your side,
3006140	3011980	your project will crumble even sooner. I don't think that that necessarily is the case
3011980	3018540	when you talk about countries that we used to refer to as developing or the Global South,
3018540	3023900	where I do still think that there are still important tasks to be done with regards to
3023900	3029100	industrialization and with regards to essentially making sure that they avoid all the traps of
3029100	3041500	underdevelopment, and where traditional 20th century socialist rhetoric is not just working,
3041500	3048140	but probably is what they need before they can move to this more, if you want to use a
3048620	3052940	fancy word, post-industrial kind of imaginary I'm toying with.
3054220	3060540	So, do you think about this question of transition in more concrete terms? Like,
3060540	3067180	what are the elements of power that one needs to think about in order to bring this about?
3067180	3070620	So, is this something that you think about?
3071100	3078460	I mean, we can't think about it. I'm just not sure it's of any use.
3078460	3079260	Oh, really?
3079260	3088540	At this point, the question is, you either try to convince the old agents of the left,
3089740	3095020	social democratic parties, trade unions, socialist parties, that this is an agenda
3095020	3100700	worth engaging with, or you just start a somewhat different movement and you try to,
3102140	3105820	I mean, we haven't even touched upon the question of class and what kind of class
3105820	3111980	relations emerge from this outlook. And there is a can of worms right there.
3112780	3118140	But thinking about the question of transition to me is premature, because I'm just not sure
3118700	3125180	that the political agent capable of even initiating that transition is there.
3125180	3130460	And I'm not sure that the current coalition, if you will, that still represents the mainstream
3130460	3140060	left, wants to take this on for all sorts of reasons. It's just not obvious how you're going
3140060	3145980	to win elections with this program. A lot of things. I mean, I think that framed properly,
3145980	3157660	you can. And to me, the number one factor is that capitalism for all its markets,
3157660	3161340	you know, however you want to frame it, but let's talk about capitalism. Capitalism for
3161340	3167820	all of the things that neoliberals say about its ability to coordinate information,
3168780	3175740	promote social coordination, discover new, facilitate becoming, it still does,
3176460	3184780	it still exercises so much power about alternative ways of doing things, of engaging with the world
3184780	3191100	and each other on ways that are not mediated by the market, of accessing knowledge that gets
3191100	3196380	suppressed and underdeveloped because somebody moves into that domain and grabs all the property
3196700	3202060	rights, intellectual property rights, and doesn't allow others to get in. I mean, the costs of
3202060	3207820	living under capitalism are much bigger than we think they are just in terms of kind of
3209580	3217100	imaginative power that we are losing by relying on it to be the central infrastructure of modernity,
3217100	3225740	if you will. And it would have been fine. We could live under this yoke forever, but we also have a
3225740	3231180	climate problem. And ultimately, if it don't solve that one, everybody's going to die. And
3231180	3239580	just very simple. And to me, that seems like the argument as to why anybody in their right mind
3240140	3246780	should be lining up for a political project that would remove that yoke and not just remove it
3246780	3253260	and replace it with nothing, but will actually target the very area where capitalism is weakest,
3253260	3258380	which I think is innovation. So in that sense, I do think that the main problem with capitalism is
3258380	3265500	that it forces society to under innovate, which in a sense is what Marx said of it in his critique.
3266380	3270940	The point was not that it's bad. It's that it innovates, but then it reaches a certain point
3270940	3275660	at which point class relations block it from innovating further and they're kind of stuck.
3276460	3280860	So you don't have to say that Marxist was an accelerationist. That was the whole point of
3280860	3288220	Marxist critique of capitalism as a modern system. And I think back in those days,
3289180	3295660	it seemed that the only thing we were losing was just maybe fancy and better technologies
3295660	3300540	or more efficient ways of organization. But now we're losing our future because
3300540	3308380	we're just going to die in the climate catastrophe. And if we don't move, then it will come faster.
3308380	3312460	So in that sense, you may start making new political arguments
3313420	3319740	that will somehow bring themes of knowledge, innovation, climate change, catastrophe,
3319740	3327100	all in one place. But I just don't see... So let's leave aside the hardcore left,
3327100	3331900	focus on the social Democrats. Social Democrats accept the mainstream neoliberal story about the
3331900	3337180	markets being good for knowledge and that they are the perfect systems for knowledge coordination
3337180	3344460	and they are perfect system for essentially making use of all the knowledge that's distributed
3344460	3350140	in society, to use one of Hayek's phrases. And it's just false. So for them to accept the story
3350140	3355340	I'm advancing, they'll just need to do some work on themselves and essentially understand that they've
3355340	3362940	made some mistakes. And then there is a space and a way to think about these questions without having
3362940	3370460	to say, no, we are with Stalin and with centralized central planning of the Soviet Union. And until
3370460	3374300	they do that, I don't think we should even be talking about transition.
3375660	3381340	It's so interesting to me that you put this aspect of discovery so much at center stage,
3381340	3389020	because my intuition would be that what you already pointed towards like the ecological question,
3389020	3397260	as well as the question of existential security, those are the ones that are, in my view,
3397260	3404860	much more important for a broader public. You could easily argue for a discovery through
3404860	3411500	existential security, since if you simply bring people into the position where they do not have to
3412060	3419660	hustle the whole day in order just to get through, then there's a huge potential of
3420620	3423420	creativity, so to speak, that would be set free.
3425980	3429660	But intellectually, I understand what you're saying. And a lot of people have made that
3429660	3435900	case with regards to the welfare state. But I just think that intellectually,
3436620	3441660	I mean, look, it's a much bigger battle than a battle between sort of neoliberalism and
3441660	3446620	whatever succeeds the people who win the socialist calculation debate. Essentially, it's a question,
3446620	3452380	it's a debate about action. You have a theory of action underpinning, I would argue,
3452380	3459820	both neoclassical economics and Austrian economics, to some extent, and much of social science,
3459820	3466300	to some extent, and much of social science, things like rational choice, which is a very
3466300	3472860	simplistic theory of action. And, you know, it starts with Weber, who partly borrows it from
3472860	3478300	Menger and a bunch of other economists of the first generation Austrian school. And it goes
3478300	3483820	something like this, you know, we're all rational, we have goals, then we find the most rational ways
3483820	3491500	of fulfilling them. And then that's it. And if we find a more efficient way of fulfilling them,
3491500	3497580	then this is innovation. And the person who does that is an entrepreneur. And what it is
3497580	3504940	to be an entrepreneur is to be always on the lookout for the more efficient means of pursuing
3504940	3510780	given ends. And that's a theory of action that I would argue, and I'm not the only one making
3510780	3517180	that case, underpins most of the theories of socialism in the actual praxis in the Soviet
3517180	3522300	Union and elsewhere. So, you know, Lange and everybody else, that's how they also think about
3522300	3527740	action. But this is wrong. I mean, this is wrong, because it doesn't account for people changing
3527740	3533660	goals along the way. And it doesn't account for much of the stuff that happens in everyday life.
3533660	3538460	I start doing something, I do it, then I understand I need to do something else. And I do it differently.
3538460	3542460	Then I realize it's all wrong, I need to do something else entirely. This is what human
3542460	3548540	action is like. And unless you build a political system that accounts for it, you're going to end
3548540	3554460	up wasting 90% of human potential and human creativity, what really makes us humans as opposed
3554460	3561900	to automatons and algorithms. Because our social system is not optimized to take advantage of the
3561900	3568140	sparks of creativity that really drive us and that make us human. And the only way that our
3568140	3574860	system currently is optimized to do that is by channeling our desires and incentives into the
3574860	3580220	price system. So if I really understand that there is something cool to be done and creative, yes,
3580220	3584700	and I want to share it with others. The only way to do that for me is to become an entrepreneur,
3584700	3590860	start a startup, seek money and put it on the market. And all I'm saying is that if we were
3590860	3596220	to build an alternative system that would actually account for how humans really are,
3596220	3600540	it would require very different theories of action, maybe informed by pragmatism,
3600540	3606460	maybe informed by something else. There are tons of, not tons, but some alternatives out there,
3606460	3613420	abduction. I mean, you can account for all sorts of things, which mainstream economic and social
3613420	3620140	theory cannot account for. Once you build an appropriate social system for that, then I think
3621100	3627500	the effects and the benefits you're going to harvest will go far beyond what you get by
3627500	3632620	currently making sure that artists have universal basic income or the welfare state is generous and
3632620	3640620	our funds arts. That's what I'm talking about. And in that sense, I don't think we are there.
3640620	3644140	And I don't think that people on the left are even interested in this question. And I think they
3644300	3650620	completely... Yeah, well, I don't know. You disagree? Tell me. Maybe there are some underground
3651580	3657020	circles that I'm not aware of. Well, I mean, I think that people are interested in so far as
3657020	3663340	I think there's a similarity of the way that you pose the problem to a certain kind of
3664780	3671740	not disappointment, but yeah, maybe it is a form of disappointment how the debate around
3671740	3677100	democratic economic planning is currently framed. Because in my view, at least, even though I'm very
3677100	3683180	much interested in the debate, obviously, I do think that it's a far too narrow scope that is
3683180	3689660	being talked about within this debate. And in so far, I think there is an interest in going beyond
3689660	3699100	this like fixation on markets as information processes, which is a scope that is not big
3699100	3704540	enough. And the way that I try to approach this is through this lens of alternative arts of
3704540	3712780	government, which is a way for me to ask different questions towards this complex of problems.
3712780	3719500	And for me, for example, this leads to questions of markets as sites of veridiction and production
3719500	3726540	of truth and stuff like that. And then you come to different, as I said, a different set of questions
3726540	3733420	and a different set of problems that we need to kind of engage with and bring up alternative
3734060	3740060	ways to approach it. So I would say there is an interest in thinking about these things in
3740060	3746380	different ways. I think I do have maybe a different timetable in terms of I would say the first thing
3746380	3753020	would be to provide some form of universal basic service and existential security.
3753020	3760540	And then on top of that, we should build these different kind of infrastructures of discovery,
3760540	3767820	so to speak, because I think that they can only be harnessed if the material basis is given for the
3767820	3773740	people who have to have basically time in order to engage with it. And so this is a different
3774300	3781020	kind of timeline. But I mean, it's not just the timeline. I mean, look, I fundamentally think
3781580	3788380	that social theory accepted in mainstream leftist circles is broken.
3790700	3794860	And it just is. And it's broken because the theory of action underpinning it is broken.
3795420	3801580	And unless you fix it, you're not going to have a robust theory that will be able to speak about
3801580	3807020	modernity, industrialization, postmodernism, whatever you want. You may say none of it is
3807020	3812300	relevant. We just want to make sure that people have tramps and enough food to eat.
3812860	3817340	And that's fine. That's a fun perspective to take. It's not either or. I just don't think,
3818300	3825180	well, sure, it's not either. Yeah, but if it's not neither or, then you're asking for the kind of
3825180	3830540	low-hanging fruit. I mean, who is going to argue on the left against universal basic services
3830540	3837900	or universal basic income, like continue to constitute it in a kind of way that will be
3837900	3846700	welfare state enhancing as opposed to libertarian Friedmanesque. So I see it as a default. To me,
3846700	3852780	that's not even an issue, to be honest. To me, the issue is that even if you engage with the
3852780	3860300	German-speaking world and you take somebody like Jurgen Habermas, he is the reference point
3860300	3868140	for German social democracy, whether you want it or not. Habermas does have a theory of action.
3868140	3871660	And the theory of action is very simple. The theory of action tells you the world is getting
3871660	3876940	more and more complex. In that sense, he agrees with Hayek and Luhman. And he tells you the only
3876940	3883340	way to reduce that complexity is by relying on markets and by relying on law, so money and legal
3883340	3889020	system. There is nothing else. And then all you can do is to eventually and sometimes push back
3889020	3893820	against the encroachments of all that complexity on the life world. And you do that through
3893820	3900140	traditional liberal institutions and the media. And that's a story accepted by and large by social
3900140	3906940	democracy. Now, is that story true? I would argue that story is not true for one simple reason,
3906940	3912940	because he's missing the most important mechanism of social coordination and reducing complexity,
3912940	3918460	which is information technology. And that you don't need to rely on
3919580	3925180	money and you don't need to rely on law. You can actually reduce complexity. And once you understand
3925180	3930380	that, then you understand that all sorts of other things become possible. You don't really need to
3930380	3935660	buy all of the bourgeois liberal political institutions we inherited from the French
3935660	3941740	Revolution whole scale, because you can have people organizing and still having all the
3941740	3946540	complexity that you want and all of the rights that they want, but doing it outside of the
3946540	3952860	traditional money system with banks and legal system with laws and bureaucracies. And I think
3952860	3959900	that unless, and that's just one example. So unless you go and piece by piece understand
3959900	3967180	what are the blocks, mental blocks and intellectual blocks, we're going to end up reusing and recycling
3967180	3973660	neoliberalism. Because to some extent for when it comes to non-communicative action in Habermas,
3973660	3979100	that's what he does. He takes Hayek and he basically says, yeah, life is getting more complex.
3979740	3984140	But what I mean by recycling neoliberalism is something very simple. The only way you account
3984140	3990700	for these creative sparks of action that I was describing 10 minutes or five minutes before
3991420	3995260	in mainstream debate is through the concept of entrepreneurship.
3996380	4000220	And now you have to invent all sorts of entrepreneurship. We have moral entrepreneurship,
4000220	4005420	ideas entrepreneurship, cultural entrepreneurship, religious, everything is entrepreneurship now,
4005420	4013260	because we have no way to account for truly new creative non-teleological behavior
4013260	4017020	in domains that are not the market. So we think everything is like the market. So we're going to
4017020	4021980	take the Austrian concept of entrepreneurship from it and insert it everywhere else in social
4021980	4027500	theory and how the world operates. And I think it's just dumb. And that will continue spreading
4027500	4033660	unless somebody stands up and says, look, you're basically working with the wrong concept because
4034460	4039100	the Austrian concept of entrepreneurship doesn't even describe entrepreneurship itself,
4039100	4043100	because it cannot tell you about entrepreneurs that suddenly decide to, I don't know,
4043580	4048380	switch from for-profit to non-profit status, pursue social entrepreneurship or completely
4048380	4052540	change their goals or completely reinvent themselves. You're still tied to the idea
4052540	4057900	that these people need to make something and that they're imprisoned by the price system.
4057900	4061500	And the only innovations they can introduce is in the techniques of production,
4062940	4066940	which is how traditionally they think. So you can switch to a better technology. You can invent
4066940	4071340	something or you can invent a new product that will be even better than your previous product.
4071340	4081180	So all I'm saying is that I think it's not either or and that I agree with you, but I do think that
4081180	4088780	without completely rebuilding social theory block by block to account for complex behavior,
4088780	4094460	to account for complex behavior, that's not just Santa Fe Institute like complexity theory,
4095180	4099660	whose whole purpose and there is own debtor, as far as I'm concerned, is to show you that
4100540	4107100	the state can never be as good as the market and kicking off economic processes,
4107100	4114700	like we need a different complexity. We need a non-neoliberal complexity favorable to the core
4114700	4121260	leftist ideals and ideas. And some of those ideas have to do with a diversity of lifestyle
4121260	4128220	and diversity of life forms producing fantastic social effects that will be disruptive, progressive,
4128220	4132620	and it will move society forward. The kind of effects that we currently attribute to the market.
4133740	4140780	And now you mentioned again that one of the tools that we definitely need to use that is
4140780	4147580	in our toolbox, but is not yet utilized in order to bring this alternatives about our digital
4147580	4155260	technologies. Can you sketch in a bit more concrete terms how specifically digital technologies can be
4155260	4164940	of use in this task? Yeah, but again, you will find it very banal. And that's all right. No,
4164940	4170300	no, no, but I just don't think that it's look, I'm the kind of guy who 10 years ago was putting the
4170300	4175180	word internet and scare quotes. And that's how I put it in my book to save everything click here,
4175180	4180300	because I didn't think that there was such a thing and that it needed to be talked about and be
4180300	4187260	ascribed all sorts of essential qualities as if it was, I don't know, something that is born with
4187260	4193180	this features and characteristics. So in that sense, if one community will be happy to use
4193180	4201660	abacus and a timetable, and another one would want an AI, I mean, great. Like it's not up for me to
4201660	4207900	like all I think all we can do as critical intellectuals is to look at the current tech
4207900	4216060	landscape and to see which parts of it make such a project unlikely or not favorable, right, both
4216060	4221580	in terms of use, because you can say that, okay, this technologies are easy to spy on, they allow
4221580	4228300	surveillance, they, they require people to pay for them with their data with money. So you can make a
4228300	4236940	critique based on use and praxis, so to say, or you can make a critique based on what the non state
4236940	4243260	ownership of this infrastructures in the current economic conjuncture means geopolitically,
4243980	4251020	because you want your basic communication, education, health care, transportation,
4251660	4257420	to be somehow run in a democratic way, where the policy decides on how to offer it, how to structure
4257420	4263500	it, how to reform it, which you would not be able to do if you integrate volunteer into your,
4264140	4268460	you know, health data, and you will not be able then to kick them back for all sorts of other
4268460	4273020	reasons, contractually and infrastructurally, right, so that this is a different side of this
4273020	4277500	is a different critique. There has nothing to do with praxis, because you can even buy into it and
4277500	4283260	say that Google offers you a fantastic tool, like a Google Calendar, great, we'll never invent
4283260	4289740	something better. You can even accept that argument on the level of use and praxis, but you can then
4289740	4295180	strike it down and strike it out based on the geopolitical meaning of delegating so much power
4295180	4302140	to a foreign company that you cannot control. So see, I think that these are the criteria
4302140	4309020	through which this has to be thought through. But beyond that, I just think you will end up
4309020	4314380	at a level of generality that will tell you that yes, overall, it's better to have infrastructures
4314380	4320860	that are generative. So you can build on them in an easier way than infrastructures that aren't
4320860	4325500	and that are closed. This is the truth we've learned in the last 50 or 60 years. Is it always
4325500	4330220	the case? No, because there are tradeoffs. And some of those tradeoffs may have to do with security,
4330220	4336220	with the fact that you just don't have access to technologies because somebody is not selling them
4336220	4342780	to you, which now is happening in China with microchips. And this is a constraint. And then
4343740	4348380	you have to live with that constraint. So I don't really think that you can arrive at a
4349900	4353820	beyond that, I don't think you can arrive at a set of more specific, at least I cannot,
4353820	4359100	at a set of more specific normative criteria that you want to have in this tech infrastructure.
4360540	4364300	Because ultimately, it has to be secondary to a political project. And unless you have
4364300	4367740	a political project, this infrastructure is not going to help.
4367740	4374940	Yeah, absolutely. And I'm actually very much looking forward to the way in which you will
4374940	4381100	hopefully lay out these ideas in your in your book at some point. Do you know when this will be ready?
4383340	4385820	Good question. You're not the only one asking me this question.
4387580	4392540	So now after two years, I'm almost done with this podcast on letter America. So I'm getting
4392540	4397820	back to the book. I think that the podcast has helped me a lot to sharpen
4399900	4406540	some of my points, particularly with regards to this managerial angle simulations modeling,
4407260	4410460	and the role that they can play in alternative leftist project on paradigm.
4411100	4419180	So my hope is to finally finish this book this summer. And if all goes well should be out next
4419180	4425580	year. Nice. Very much looking forward. Did it bring you the podcast project? Did it bring you
4425580	4434300	forward in terms of thinking about the political project as well? Yes and no. I mean, it was a
4434300	4443580	project very much focused on Latin America and the Caribbean. So in the 60s and 1970s. And
4444540	4450300	so it's a very different time with the Cold War and multinational corporations and spy agencies.
4451340	4462620	So it did in a sense that you see, you see how a lot of the challenges and problems that a country
4462620	4467260	like China is going through right now, for example, when it comes to technological sovereignty and
4467500	4475260	its desire to break from the technological dependence on Western Europe and North America,
4476060	4483420	how these debates already were had in the 60s and 70s and how in a sense,
4484140	4490060	China is doing what some Latin American countries in the end impact, for example,
4490060	4497340	where Chile and Peru were members in Ecuador, I think, that they tried to do in the late 1960s,
4497340	4506220	early 1970s. So in a sense, yes, I don't think maybe you can apply some of those lessons to Europe
4506860	4514620	too, in a sense. But I think to me, there is really no possibility of a political project
4514620	4522940	without a geopolitical project. So I think, if you will, the condition of possibility for the
4522940	4528460	kind of progressive political project that all of us are hoping for as a certain geopolitical
4528460	4536780	situation and a certain geopolitical outlook. And I don't think that we should ignore that,
4536860	4545340	that it would require a more bolder stance vis-a-vis the United States, possibly,
4545340	4552780	or at least vis-a-vis Wall Street and Silicon Valley and others. And yeah, I just don't think
4552780	4561500	that you can have harmony while at the same time pursuing some kind of an agenda that would replace
4561500	4569260	their tack with European tack. I don't think it will be easy. And as long as it's realized, then
4569260	4577500	it's fine. Very much looking forward to this book, I have to say. Evgeny, at the end, I always ask
4577500	4585900	the question, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful? Yeah, I've listened to a podcast,
4585900	4598220	I should have prepared for this question. What makes me joyful? I mean, ultimately, I think that
4598220	4615660	there are, how should I put it? Yeah, I know, I don't really know. So nothing makes me joyful
4615660	4622380	in the very specific sense, because I think optimism is the kind of luxury that we cannot
4622380	4632060	really afford at this point. But let me think about it some more. Well, I mean, I don't want to sound
4632060	4638300	like one of those accelerationist guys and celebrating the power of technology to solve
4638300	4645820	all these questions. But I do think that if there is a silver lining, yeah, that's the right term,
4645820	4653020	silver lining, to the kind of rise of big tack in the last 10, well, in the last 15 or 20 years,
4654300	4665420	it's that it showed us that so much social coordination is possible in a completely
4665420	4670940	non-market way. And we have not realized that yet. I mean, if you think about all the tools,
4670940	4676300	all the apps, that all these people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere obsessed with productivity,
4676300	4681420	with collaboration and coordination are using. I mean, yes, you might be paying something for them.
4682140	4686860	But what they probably don't realize is that ultimately, they're not coordinating through
4686860	4691820	the price system. I mean, they're using the price system to get access to a non-market system of
4691820	4698220	coordination. And Silicon Valley has consistently showing us that collaboration and coordination
4698940	4703980	happens outside of the market. And with enough money being poured into it,
4703980	4709900	it can become even deeper and better and faster and more efficient. And in that sense,
4712060	4718300	that is the best argument against relying on the market to facilitate social coordination
4718300	4724460	a la Hayek that we have seen. And that does make me optimistic, but that requires
4725420	4730540	somebody to see. And if a tree falls in the forest, then there is nobody to see it.
4731180	4739340	So if people will be able to see that element of it, great. But I think right now, the only
4739340	4744220	thing we have seen in this phenomenon, by and large in the public debate, is the opposite,
4744220	4751900	is the idea that the market is so much better than the non-market building these cool things.
4751900	4759580	And to some extent, I mean, it's not true, but they have built them. But that's not the point.
4760300	4763820	The point is what these things allow us to do and what they allow us to do is to completely
4763820	4770300	bypass the market when it comes to coordinating. And as long as you understand that, then you're
4770380	4776220	fired. That's so interesting that you frame it this way now at the end again, because I think
4776220	4784140	that, I mean, leaving aside the too narrow focus within the debate, at least this point that you
4784140	4791420	just stated, I think this is absolutely part of the like revived planning debate, that there is
4791420	4799340	potential in these types of non-market coordination, at least in future histories. This features
4800700	4806540	definitely features in future histories, I would say, no? The fact that these technologies do
4806540	4812140	provide some form of alternative coordination. Sure, sure, sure. But the question, I think this
4812140	4818380	is Jan, gets us to the heart of it. The question then becomes, what do you need this coordination
4818380	4826300	for? And I think that this is a philosophical question. And for a lot of people, including,
4826540	4831500	I would say most of the people involved in the democratic planning debate, this coordination
4831500	4836300	is just a way of fulfilling the need to distribute and allocate goods
4839500	4844220	by and large, because this is the primary focus, right? They're not really stepping into the world
4844220	4849900	of discovery, becoming creativity and so forth. Because ultimately, it's almost like they operate
4849900	4854460	with a Maslow pyramid of some kind, right? And this is what, for many people, that's what,
4855020	4859820	Marx operates with it to some extent, too. So if you look at this kind of the distinction,
4859820	4863660	and I mentioned it in some of my talks, you heard that the distinction in the realm of necessity,
4865580	4869020	what is it? The realm of necessity and the realm of freedom, right? Ultimately,
4871260	4878220	even if you want to be 100% just to Marx, you have to acknowledge that he put a lot of effort
4878220	4885020	into thinking about the realm of necessity and not enough into thinking about the realm of freedom,
4886540	4894380	right? And in a sense, because maybe it was too far into the future. Maybe it's because it's all,
4894380	4899260	maybe it would just have some kind of a liberal, I'm not saying that's what Marx wrote, but that's
4899260	4904460	one possible interpretation. Maybe we'll have some kind of a liberal interpretation of everybody to
4904460	4909180	their own devices. And as long as we coordinate production in the workshop in a democratic way,
4909820	4914780	what you do when you hunt and drink wine and write poetry in the afternoon,
4914780	4919260	like it doesn't matter. So we shouldn't think about it. And I think that's a mistake. So if
4919260	4923340	there is like one big message, I'd like to leave you with is that I think it's a mistake because
4923340	4930300	in a sense, the neoliberals understood that it's that element that accounts for the most exciting
4930300	4936780	parts of modernity. So this is the stuff that really gets people excited about technology,
4936780	4941820	cities, urbanization, modernization. It's that part. It's not the satisfaction of basic needs.
4941820	4945660	And they argue that the market is key to satisfying it. So this is one reason why I
4945660	4951180	think the lab should engage with planning in the realm of freedom more than it has.
4951980	4958700	And the second reason is that I do think that the realm of freedom, once organized properly,
4958700	4964220	is productive of value that can then, in the non-Marxist meaning of the term,
4964220	4970300	that can then feed back to satisfy the needs in the realm of necessities. And that's,
4970300	4976300	to some extent, what Silicon Valley has done. They allowed you to do whatever you want in your
4976300	4981660	everyday life. They get all the data through your devices about what it is that you do,
4981660	4985660	and then they monetize it. And then they do whatever they want with that money.
4986620	4991260	And so if you really want to have a socialist biopolitics, that's a good candidate.
4991820	4999100	They are appropriating that and making sure that value is generated from that,
4999100	5003260	not just individual everyday life, living your life the way you want, but also from
5003260	5007980	collectivity because we all engage in it collectively. And once analyzed collectively,
5007980	5013260	of course, this data has enormous value when it comes to traffic analysis or epidemiological
5013260	5020220	trends and so forth. But that comes from us being, I'm sorry, in the realm of freedom,
5020220	5023740	by and large, or at least in the realm of social reproduction, if you really want to
5024620	5034460	be middle-groundish about it. So in that sense, I do agree that the questions like this have
5034460	5038460	attracted the attention of people on the left. I just think they're asking them in the wrong register.
5039100	5046220	Intuitively, if you go to a person who is now struggling in subsistence and you ask them,
5046220	5054780	is it either the realm of necessity that should be covered first or should we immediately jump
5054780	5060300	into the realm of freedom, I'm pretty sure that the first will say, oh, please, let's start with
5060300	5066940	the realm of necessity. But again, if you were to talk longer,
5067740	5074300	I mean, I can tell you that I don't think that dichotomy is accurate. So I don't think that
5074300	5078460	that's the correct way to think about it. You're not going to get very far if you really pose the
5078460	5084300	question this way, because once you start with both of them separated like that, which assumes
5084300	5089580	a division between work and non-work that's very strict, that's separate, that's things that value
5089580	5094140	is produced in the workplace, of course, you're going to end up with the most obvious conclusion.
5094700	5099420	So me personally, and I think I even said it in the Berkeley talk and some other talk,
5100140	5104060	I don't think that that's a helpful way to think about it. So we need to get away from the
5104060	5110460	separation because most of the people on the left, them who did think about the realm of freedom,
5113580	5117500	they still end up saying that we need to reintroduce the realm of freedom into the realm
5117500	5122780	of necessity. The way Marcuse would, for example, he will tell you, oh, factory work should be like
5122780	5131580	a playground. And I just don't think that you're going to end up in a helpful way. But
5132860	5139340	just to counter back to what you said, if you stick with my analysis, then
5140460	5144940	you can say that, well, I mean, why is that person starving? I mean, if you really build a system
5144940	5150220	on my model, the money that currently ends up with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg will be funding
5151180	5161580	his welfare. Because that money right now, I mean, my realm of freedom, if not his,
5162300	5168780	is being expropriated, appropriated and monetized in a way that leaves that person starving.
5168780	5175660	So why is that a trivial issue? And I don't know what the right answer is. It doesn't seem
5175660	5182380	to be trivial. It seems to me that clearly, once you understand that the rise of Big Tech,
5182380	5190220	to some extent, is linked to the ability to tap into everyday life and to tap into our social
5190220	5197020	coordination with each other and to monetize it and extract profits from it and to strip public
5197020	5201420	coffers of their avenues that would have otherwise been there, then yeah, I mean,
5201420	5206140	I don't think it's such a reasonable question to ask. So of course, that's why I was saying
5207180	5211260	earlier that I don't think that this is the right paradigm, for example, for the global south,
5211900	5215900	where you still probably need to be building factories and have people working there,
5215900	5219580	you need to industrialize, you need to build your own base, you need to recreate,
5219580	5223260	instead of relying on global supply chains, recreate some of the capacity domestically,
5224220	5231180	it will be fine with the older socialist program. So I understand the geopolitical
5231740	5237820	and regional bias, what I'm saying, but I don't think that the fact that there are,
5241180	5244860	I don't think that the fact that there are, you know, people who are poor or homeless or
5245660	5251420	who have troubles right now, which can be immediately resolved, should take off pressure
5251420	5261500	of us to find holes in legitimation strategies of neoliberals, or contribute to articulating
5261500	5267820	an alternative political project. Because the fact that people are hungry right now,
5268380	5272300	stripped of the ideological context tells you absolutely nothing, you might as well
5272300	5277740	believe that Elon Musk should give them basic income, or some philanthropist should fund
5277740	5284700	something for them. Right? So to me, the presence of evil in the world, as such,
5284700	5291340	that is easily fixable. It's no reason not to engage, which I think we both agree on that.
5291340	5296140	But I just want to reiterate it, because like, for me, they're not somehow,
5297180	5299340	one is not the reason not to think about the other.
5299500	5306700	Mm hmm. Yeah, no, no, I absolutely agree with that. Maybe it's that I
5308940	5318140	think about the ability to bring about the new in different ways. Or maybe I don't see it as
5318140	5324140	that much of a challenge. But I think I get the point you're making. At least I think I get the
5324140	5329820	point you're making in terms of providing... But that was the project for Marx, though.
5330860	5337660	So I really think that what is Marxism? Marxism is very simple. You have social relations of
5337660	5341180	production that eventually block forces of production from advancing further.
5341820	5346060	It's just a philosophy of the new. There is nothing else in Marx. That's the core idea,
5346060	5352700	it's that. And that you need to change relations of production so that the forces of production
5352700	5357900	can continue unimpeded. And you can, of course, make all sorts of cases for ecology and whatever,
5357900	5363420	and they're all important points. But ultimately, that's what it is. So I mean, the question of the
5363420	5369660	new and its sustained, almost industrial, methodological, theoretical production,
5369660	5376060	it's at the core of the leftist project. Yes, but there are a lot of questions that
5376060	5381340	are connected to that. The question of if we needed to think progressivism in a different way,
5381340	5388700	for example, I'm not sure if we can just jump into this competition, so to speak,
5388700	5397740	with the neoliberals and accept this premise in the first place of markets as the harbingers of
5397740	5406380	the production of the new, and then try to... But that's where we disagree, I think,
5406380	5410700	because I think it's just undeniable. It's undeniable. I also think phenomenologically
5411340	5416540	for the majority of the population. That's so interesting. I mean, you just need to open an
5416540	5420460	app store. I mean, don't you see all the apps? I mean, how you can possibly deny that that's
5420460	5424540	the production of the new? I mean, that's what people think... Well, I mean, there's an argument...
5424540	5430140	Well, there's a strong argument to make that capitalism is like the production of the ever
5430140	5438060	old in new forms. That's an argument that is out there and it has some form of plausibility
5438060	5446780	to it as well. The way in which markets and capitalism are able to produce the news is a
5446780	5454540	very, very narrow corridor in which we have this accelerated perpetuation of the old, actually,
5454540	5459740	and not really the production of the new, which is, I think, what you actually want to state,
5459740	5464860	what you are stating. So maybe we are not a part of this.
5464860	5468540	No, no, I believe in productivity improvements. So I believe that there are productivity
5468540	5473900	improvements in capitalist firms that are real. So they're not inventions. If they were just the
5473900	5480140	recycling of the old, there is no reason for capitalist firms to fake the production of
5480140	5484860	productivity improvements. Because if they do that, they're just going to be eaten alive.
5484860	5489900	In that sense, I do believe in competition. Yeah. But that's why I mentioned that it's
5489900	5495020	also important to talk about new ways of thinking about progress, because it's not only about
5495020	5502460	productivity improvements, no? Because this way of thinking, this logic has brought us into a place
5502460	5508540	where we are aiming through a catastrophe. But that's a different argument from saying
5508540	5514460	that they're repackaging the old. So I was invoking that in the sense that I don't think
5514460	5517740	they're repackaging the old, because if they're repackaging the old, they'll just be out of
5517740	5521980	business as individual capitalists. And in that sense, I think if you read somebody like Anwar
5521980	5528140	Shaikh, who I think is the Marxist economist who's done almost like his view on competition is the
5528140	5533260	same as mine and is the same to some extent as Hayek's. So competition is real and it does
5533260	5539500	produce new things, both on the consumption side and on the production side. You can make all sorts
5539500	5544940	of arguments. And that's partly what I'm saying, that there are other ways in which new is generated,
5544940	5550940	because there are other ways in which we coordinate. And so far, we've put all of our resources,
5550940	5556300	all of our thinking and money and laws into boosting markets as the only infrastructure
5556300	5560700	of doing that. But clearly, that's not the only infrastructure. But to me, it seems,
5561740	5566380	and we need it for all sorts of reasons that I accept have to do with redefining progress
5566380	5572140	and so forth. But to me, to deny that there is something new produced in the markets by both
5572140	5578620	producers and consumers, and that is valid. And that part of the neoliberal argument is correct,
5578620	5583820	just to me, since it's counterproductive, because it just rejects our phenomenological
5583820	5590700	everyday experience. And I see no problem in accepting that part of the story.
5590700	5598220	Yeah. Well, I mean, if you state it this way, then I wouldn't say that there is nothing new
5598220	5602460	being produced. But that's actually bringing us to a question that I wanted to ask you,
5602460	5608380	but I actually didn't, because maybe you could specify what you mean by the new. Is it just
5608380	5616380	productivity gains? So if you talk about that has to be replaced when it comes to this question of
5616380	5623020	the production of the new, what is the new? How do you define it?
5623020	5627180	Well, but I mean, does it need to be defined?
5627820	5630060	Well, it makes a big difference.
5630060	5636460	I mean, if you look at it in terms of practices, these are practices and ways of being and ways of
5638060	5643820	existing that were not there before when you started. I mean, we just need to introduce
5643820	5651340	a temporal element in this. And you're going to see practices and ways of doing things that
5651340	5658860	were not there before, ways of doing old things in new ways or ways of doing completely new things.
5658860	5668060	I mean, if you define it in this way, the new is being produced in many different social fields
5668060	5675580	all the time. But who's denying that? You are telling me things that are the core of my argument
5675580	5680380	and I'm trying to build an infrastructure for scaling them up and generating value out of them.
5680380	5687180	Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I think it's just that I think why we land at this position is that
5687180	5694460	I'm not sure if the thing that market competition is able to provide when it comes to
5694460	5700220	building the new is as huge as you or it should be
5701020	5707900	problematized much more than maybe you would do it. But I think we're circling around
5708540	5712460	in different ways. Yeah, but it also depends. I mean, look,
5713420	5718860	it depends on what your project is. It depends on how you think about
5718860	5723340	neoliberalism. I don't think about this as an economic theory. I think about it as a
5723340	5729100	theory of modernity. I think about it as a theory of civilization, essentially. That tells you
5729660	5738780	precisely, I'm sorry to say, how do you incorporate the new into your life and into the world?
5738780	5745020	If you read Hayek, it's just there stated very clearly that, yes, he tells you there are all
5745020	5749980	sorts of effects if you put the cash nexus where you previously had social relations or family ties.
5749980	5758220	But in the long run, the pie expands and the pie expands even if certain people end up as lawyers.
5758220	5763500	And it expands precisely because this new stuff is being produced and is being produced in a
5763500	5768620	sustainable way as far as capitalism is concerned. We don't talk about climate and other things.
5768620	5777900	And this is what market civilization does. It's not about coordinated firms and consumers.
5777900	5785340	It's about bringing novelty into the world. And I don't know, like, how is that not to me?
5785340	5788620	And if you look at the legitimation of neoliberalism, that's the reason why
5789260	5795820	it's of any appeal, unless it's imposed by force. That is the most exciting part of neoliberalism,
5796780	5804220	which is so exciting that social democrats are buying into it. And if you really want to
5804940	5813580	and if you really want to unthrone it or disrone it, you need to have an alternative account
5813580	5821580	of how society can move forward and structurally, infrastructurally produce the new in a way that
5821580	5826700	scales up. And that's not just about arts and crafts and artisanal people building things,
5826700	5832140	but that there are actually ways to interconnect people in, I don't know, Ecuador with people in
5832140	5838140	Moldova, which is what the market does and make sure the changes in one proxies then are reflected
5838140	5844540	in the life and in the proxies of the other. Ultimately, what I'm saying is that there are
5844540	5853500	infrastructures that allow people to coordinate, collaborate, produce things, whether these things
5853580	5862380	are effects or emotions or ideas or things that have all of the markings of what neoliberals
5862380	5870220	attribute to market civilization without most of the costs. And that if you, they're not developed
5870220	5876060	because public policy is such that it doesn't channel resources there. You cannot scale them
5876140	5882940	up properly. You cannot, your only turn, your only option is towards the market.
5885660	5892140	And that's why we have all these idealistic people who beyond protesting, if they really want to do
5892140	5899500	something, like what do they do? Like they form a startup and they become, you know, in most cases
5899500	5904700	and they seek money and they know that this will allow them to scale. If they don't want to be just
5904700	5910460	local operators and if they want to scale, that's what they need to do. Why? Because our entire
5910460	5918140	civilization favors the market as the default and only infrastructure of scaling up this coordination
5918140	5924380	and generating value out of it. But you can have a multiplicity of them. That's why in one of my
5924380	5931980	earlier articles in New Left Review, I basically said, look, Hayek has a flawed evolutionary theory
5931980	5937900	and what he says about how people become less altruistic as they move from villages to cities
5937900	5943740	is wrong. That evolutionary theory actually teaches us otherwise. And that you might as well say that
5944380	5951580	solidarity will be as productive, what Hayek calls discovery, as competition. It's basically like,
5951580	5955900	there is no reason to believe that he's correct on that point and I don't think he is. But it
5955900	5960620	doesn't mean that solidarity is the only thing that can do it. You can maybe list 10 values that
5960620	5966140	will do it. Maybe you can list 20 and maybe you can list infrastructures that will go along with
5966140	5973180	them to enable them and to elicit these behaviors and to elicit these orientations. So I mean,
5973180	5978300	I don't know. To me, that seems like the core question of how do you organize modernity
5979580	5984940	rather than a trivial one. It's not about making sure we have a different system for building apps.
5985420	5992700	It's a way for me of thinking about how do you move society forward and embrace the new
5993340	5998300	in a structured way that bypasses the dichotomy of the market and the state
5999180	6004620	and refuses the idea that the only way to do it in a scaled up way is by relying on the market.
6004620	6009660	I absolutely agree. I think it's maybe because maybe you are holding something back that is
6009660	6013740	in the book and in your thinking because there's something missing. I absolutely agree with
6013740	6020140	everything you just said. But for example, within capitalism, you do have private property
6020140	6028540	as a form of guiding lens that is able to unify these actions much as the
6029500	6036860	market as competition does. So you will have a mechanism that is able to provide a form of
6037820	6042540	like pre-coordination maybe. And in the way that you describe the alternative,
6043660	6049980	I think, of course, it's right to point out that there needs to be a multiplicity of different
6049980	6055740	approaches that look at different aspects of, for example, the market, but also different
6057260	6064300	regional contexts and stuff like that. But then still, you would have to come up with an answer
6064300	6075340	that provides this glue, this form of maybe directionality that is provided in capitalism
6075340	6080940	through private property and markets as competition. You would have to find a different form of
6082300	6089100	mechanism for the production of pre-configuration, so to speak, for the alternative.
6089580	6097180	But no, I don't think so. I don't think it's my problem. No. Why? Because we're not trying
6097180	6105660	to build, in that sense, I depart from describing what so far we have been talking about for the
6105660	6112220	last 10 minutes as a socialism. Because if you really wanted to, it's a non-capitalism at best,
6113180	6118460	what I'm describing. And as a non-capitalism, it's not post-capitalism, it's a non-capitalism.
6118940	6123100	And if you really want to go really far, you can say that you can have a multiplicity of
6123100	6130460	non-capitalisms. And I don't think that it requires any grounding, for example, in an alternative
6130460	6136860	property regime. I don't. You might argue that it would require certain rights to preserve those
6136860	6141340	forms of right, to observe those forms of life. You might argue that you would need a right to
6141340	6147260	ignorance of something, because that would be the only way to preserve certain core features.
6147260	6151500	We might argue that you would need some kind of an institutional slack so that you don't
6151500	6160380	over-optimize. But to generalize it to a theory that as a guiding lens here would be to convert
6160380	6167340	it into an ism, which is not what I'm trying to do. So at best, my ism is a non-ism and it's a
6167340	6176060	non-capitalism. Nice. Good answer. Even though I'm not saying that it would need to be a different
6176060	6181420	form of property regime that would provide this type of glue that I'm talking about.
6184940	6189420	I also think you're mistaken with regards to property, to be honest. I can easily imagine,
6189420	6195500	and in fact it exists, you can have capitalist relations now where property would be
6197180	6203340	very different from the one we have, property regime, and where you would be able to look at
6203340	6216060	the radical markets, people. If a certain piece of equipment is not used well by the capitalists
6216060	6220540	who owns it, we're just going to come in and take it and put it on the auction and somebody
6220540	6225820	will come in and buy it. That's a complete violation of the private property that you
6225820	6229660	think is constitutive of capitalism, and I just don't think that for them it's constitutive of
6229660	6240460	capitalism. Fair enough. Good point. I don't think I'm holding back. Sorry, maybe I'm just
6240460	6249660	in my bubble. To me, it seems pretty obvious. I live in a village here. Look at my books here.
6250620	6258780	It's not exactly the most exciting reading you have here. It's possible I live in a bubble here,
6259020	6272140	but I do think that there is something there. You're the person monitoring all the discourses
6272140	6280700	most closely, so if anybody is guarded against being too much in a bubble, I think it's you,
6280700	6287180	Evgeny. It's fair enough to say that there is a lot there, I think.
