00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,460
Silvia Federici in today's episode.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,560
She is a highly influential feminist scholar, teacher and activist known for her groundbreaking

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,480
work on the intersections of capitalism, patriarchy and reproductive labor.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,820
I am very happy that this episode came together, since Silvia's work provides crucial insight

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,500
into the question of how the separation of spheres in which there is a sphere of production,

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,820
which is imagined as separate of a sphere of reproduction, how this imagined separation

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,860
might be overcome.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,580
This podcast here has featured quite a few models of democratic economic planning, which,

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,860
I have to be honest, oftentimes struggle to treat this question adequately.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,420
And it's great to have Silvia bring in her perspective on these topics.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,840
And since we touch up on the topic of commoning and commons in the course of our conversation

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,060
as well, if you're interested in questions of how democratic coordination of commoning

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,180
on a scale, I wanted to point you towards the newly translated book by Stefan Merec

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,220
and Simon Sutterluty called Make Capitalism History.

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,980
You'll find the open access publication in the show notes.

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,780
And then another note, just like the episodes with Matt Huber and Elisa Longkorn anti-Leo,

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,140
this episode also came together because of a conference I was recently invited to take

19
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,140
part in.

20
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,100
The conference was titled The Great Transition, and I was invited to take part in a symposium

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,420
on democratic planning.

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,860
And I just wanted to take the chance to say thanks to everybody involved.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:58,020
Before we start, I wanted to also thank Lukas, Wilfried, and Carl for their kind donations.

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,420
And now please enjoy today's episode with Silvia Federici.

25
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,820
Silvia, I'm thrilled and honored to have you on the show.

26
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,820
Welcome.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Yes.

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,220
Thank you so much.

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:23,180
And, you know, I would like this to be a conversation and you introduce me to the topic of today

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,900
and give me a little bit of the background of, you know, introduce your audience to the

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,460
issues and the topic that we're going to discuss today.

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,460
Yes, absolutely.

33
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,060
Well, I think we will start with a question that goes in the direction of your critique

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,540
towards the idea of progress, and then we'll kind of move along to topics of commons and

35
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,060
topics of democratic planning, maybe.

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,460
I'm very much interested in this topic.

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,500
And at the end, I will have some questions around the question whether or not we should

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,980
overcome the category of labor as such, because in some of the models for democratic planning,

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,340
for example, unfortunately, the category of labor is not overcome and there are still

40
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,380
some forms of connection between work and pay.

41
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,820
And I'm quite critical of this approach, so I would be interested in what you think about

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
it.

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,820
But we will start with a question on progress, if that's all right with you.

44
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:38,180
Of course, you know, but there is a broad literature to which, you know, I refer, actually,

45
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:48,060
that has criticized, you know, progress as enlightenment, bourgeois conception, you know,

46
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,740
that it's very evolutionary.

47
00:03:50,740 --> 00:04:00,220
It's a very evolutionary conception, but has been used to actually justify, you know, capitalist

48
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:11,500
development, yes, justify and in a sense, you know, erase, erase the cost of it, erase,

49
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:20,660
you know, all the atrocities that capitalist development has left and in its wake.

50
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,660
So and, you know, sponsored in order to realize.

51
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,020
So progress, it's a great lie.

52
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,900
Progress is the great lie, you know, of capitalist ideology.

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,900
And in fact, we can really measure.

54
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
How do we measure progress?

55
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,340
I think this is a very fundamental question.

56
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,820
How do we measure progress?

57
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,060
What are the value?

58
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:57,220
What are the core value that enable us to decide whether a society is progressing or not?

59
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,580
And within capitalist ideology, you know, progress is measured in terms of technological

60
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,180
development, so that today, for example, we can communicate Vienna and New York.

61
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,380
We can communicate this is progress.

62
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,260
Obviously, people could not do it in the Middle Ages.

63
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:25,980
But when we look, for example, today in terms of true exchange of knowledge, can we really

64
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:34,260
say that the technology has allowed human being as a whole, you know, the human community

65
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:41,820
to really exchange, grow in terms of its understanding of each other?

66
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,780
No, obviously not.

67
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,300
You know, we have a situation of permanent wealth here now in most parts of the world.

68
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,020
If we did have real progress, we wouldn't have two centuries of capitalist development

69
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,020
that have destroyed the life of millions and millions and millions of people.

70
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:09,300
No, so that when technological development is, in fact, as in fact, being primarily put

71
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,140
at the service, you know, of capitalist accumulation of individual private wealth and

72
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,900
military destruction, World War One, millions of people killed, World War Two, the threat

73
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,620
of nuclear warfare, we are now speaking of a society in which even life, even human life

74
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,100
is such because of the technology, because of the very so-called technological development

75
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:45,540
that is associated with the notion of progress, then we can see that we have to really

76
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:54,020
reconceptualize what is valuable, you know, what is that we should struggle for, what kind of

77
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:03,620
society we want to construct. So let's leave behind as totally tainted the notion of progress

78
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:12,580
and instead seeing that this development that is associated with progress, you know,

79
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,100
as in fact brought more and more misery, more and more impoverishment. Today there are millions

80
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,140
and millions of people who are totally impoverished, who have been expelled from their lands,

81
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:30,900
whose cultures have been destroyed, thousands of languages, species, you know, natural species,

82
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,820
and also human community have been completely destroyed. Entire cultural world is like,

83
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,740
what progress is that? What is the measurement we use? So this is my response to progress.

84
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,340
There is this strand within like orthodox Marxism, which likes to argue that first there

85
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,580
has to be capitalism that would sufficiently develop the forces of production and only then

86
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,140
on the basis of that, like real communism would be possible. And of course, you refuse this notion,

87
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:10,900
but I'm asking myself, what does this mean for alternatives to capitalism then for

88
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,380
this idea of transition as well? Because I have to think, for example, about the recent work of

89
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,220
Kohai Saito. I don't know if you're familiar with his work. He's developing this idea of degrowth

90
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:31,860
communism, which is kind of arguing in a similar direction that progress in the capitalist sense

91
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,820
is not necessary to develop communism. I would be interested in your opinion

92
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:44,740
on what does this mean to reject this specific idea of progress for the question of alternatives

93
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:52,180
to capitalism. Absolutely. So the question of, I think, Marx's idea, and you know,

94
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:00,420
it would be very interesting. I think that probably Marx lived at the historical

95
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,140
and political conjunction. This is the sense I can make of it, that he lived at historical

96
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:20,740
political conjunction, where the possibility of a broad social change, of a crisis of capitalism,

97
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:29,700
of the end of capitalism, seemed to be near, seemed to be soon possible. Therefore,

98
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,500
you know, this image, you know, of the worker who takes over the capitalist machine

99
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:46,500
and now redirects it, you know, once, you know, redirects it to a different goal, redirects it,

100
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:53,460
you know, to the benefit of humanity, to an egalitarian, the purposes of an egalitarian

101
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:03,380
society, etc., etc. So I think this is how I can justify Marx's idea that in a way, capitalism,

102
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:10,500
obviously, you know, capitalism, a necessary stage, well, necessary because it was an inevitable

103
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,740
stage from the point of view, you know, obviously of the power relation in Europe, but that it would

104
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:25,860
be necessary, you know, for constructing the condition, you know, of a communist society,

105
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:34,420
you know. As I said, Marx must have come to this conclusion only because he believed the revolution

106
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:43,700
was imminent. Otherwise, he would have had to consider what is the cost, you know, of a process

107
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,260
of large scale industrialization across the world, even from the point of view,

108
00:10:50,900 --> 00:11:00,500
right, of, you know, what it costs to industrialize the globe in terms of its impact of nature.

109
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:09,540
But that's only one consideration. What he did not consider is the capitalist development

110
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:18,100
destroys the very condition for a communist society, creates technological conditions,

111
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,020
but destroys other conditions, destroy, for example, changes, people's subjectivities,

112
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:35,700
you know, destroys common solidarity, destroys commonality, and, you know, so whereas

113
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:45,140
it creates, you know, new technological means, new technological means, at the same time there's

114
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:52,740
a process of destruction, of destruction of human relations, you know, that makes the advantage of

115
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:00,180
a new technology, the advantage of a new technology, right, you know, limits tremendously what the

116
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:09,220
advantage, and there's a third consideration, which is, is it really technological underdevelopment

117
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,980
that was the cause in the Middle Ages or other society, you know, of people's misery, of people's

118
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,340
hunger, of communities inability to reproduce themselves, or it was the social relation,

119
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,980
the fact that in the Middle Ages you had a feudal old, a feudal world that was built on the

120
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,580
exploitation of people, where those who made decision was a military class, right, so the idea

121
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:48,100
that in a way capitalism was necessary because it provided the means to, you know, overcome hunger,

122
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:54,740
overcome poverty, overcome scarcity, no, technology was never the problem of scarcity,

123
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,020
technology, the lack of technology, and we know, for example, that there were other roads to

124
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,420
technological development, for example in China, China had reached a quite high level of technological

125
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:15,060
development by the 16th century, there were other roads to technology, other than the capitalist one,

126
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,300
that the fact that the capitalist road to technological development, you know, was built

127
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,900
on the exploitation of labor, on the destruction of community, on violence, all this also

128
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,580
undermined, you know, the advantages, and moreover, what, what technology was invented,

129
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,580
capitalism invented a technology that was instrumental to exploitation,

130
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:48,820
it's not the technology, technology is not a general term, technology is not a universal,

131
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:56,340
you know, road or a form of wealth, you know, what kind of technology capitalism has developed,

132
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,620
other type of technology, the technology capitalism has developed has always been a

133
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:10,820
political technology, a technology that served to defeat, right, to contrast, you know, work as

134
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:17,140
solidarity, work as capacity to resist, work as capacity to struggle, so it is the technology

135
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,540
that has always had built within it a political problem, capitalist technology has always built

136
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:31,380
within itself elements that made it impossible to take over by a communist, a real communist

137
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,700
society, for instance, disregard for nature, a technology that has disregard for nature is not

138
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,980
a technology we can use, it's not a technology that should be generalized across the world,

139
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,500
a technology that is built within itself, you know, a program that is antagonistic to work as

140
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,100
solidarity, antagonistic, so yes, capitalism brings workers together, but how it brings workers

141
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:04,100
together, not in a way that enhances their solidarity, so I think that Marx was wrong

142
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,620
in terms of this idea that of the transfer of technology, right, okay, so the revolution

143
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,420
and then we take over the machine and we put the machine to good use, well that machine could not

144
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,380
be put because it had built-in problems, other machines have to be used, no, and secondly,

145
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:30,180
it did not see the kind of devastation, you know, and now it's all too obvious,

146
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:39,460
now it's all too obvious. One last thing, I don't particularly, of course, I'm against the idea of

147
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,420
capitalist growth because capitalist world growth is capitalist development, it's capitalism,

148
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,500
right, but I don't think that growth is the enemy, the enemy is capitalism, growth is a

149
00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:01,060
subcategory, it's a subcategory, it's one of the pieces, right, it's one of the strategies

150
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:08,820
that capitalism uses to reproduce itself, no, but it's not growth, the enemy is capitalism,

151
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,340
the enemy is the exploitation of nature and humanity, this is the fundamental and in this,

152
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:23,620
in a way, I agree with Marx, you know, that I think that the powerful expert and still alive

153
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:32,660
and still fundamental expert of Marx's work, you know, is having focus and identify capitalism

154
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:40,180
as a system that is built, you know, on the accumulation of people's labor, on the exploitation,

155
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:48,900
on expropriation, dispossession, right, on therefore these forms of, you know, alienation,

156
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,260
enslavement, et cetera, et cetera, and constant immiseration because once you take away from people

157
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,300
the means of their reproduction, then there is no limit to how much you can immiserate their life,

158
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,420
and we see now where we live in a world of permanent welfare, permanent dispossession,

159
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:13,460
millions and millions thrown, you know, into refugee camps, you know, entire areas,

160
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:22,020
you know, of the world destroyed by climatic change. So, yes, we really need to rethink

161
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,020
this idea about the necessity of capitalism, God forbid.

162
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,740
Yeah, and I would really like to explore a bit the question of alternatives because

163
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:43,780
if we do not go along the road of ideas of, let's say, socialist modernity, so to speak,

164
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,140
what is the alternative that you would like to come about? I mean, you already pointed towards

165
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,500
we, of course, need alternative social relations. We might also need alternative technologies,

166
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,100
you pointed out. I mean, you are quite famous for your engagement with this idea of commoning.

167
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,020
It's an important part of your research. I'm quite sure that commoning would have to be an

168
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,500
element of the alternative as well, but there are many examples where commoning works quite well

169
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,540
within communal structures up to a certain size, I would say. Community-supported agriculture would

170
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,420
be one example, and there are many, many more, and there are also examples for commoning on a global

171
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:33,700
scale in the realm of digital commons, which are easily reproducible and, let's say, nonrivalous.

172
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:45,860
There are less examples for global commons that are rival resources, so to speak. I would be

173
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,180
interested in how you think about what might collective forms of organization look like

174
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:59,860
at a level of society as a whole that are organized along this principle of commoning.

175
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:10,740
Yeah, so first of all, what commons will be like is almost very difficult, and I don't think it is

176
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:21,380
useful to actually have a map, a theoretical political map now, because even our own imagination

177
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:29,300
is very much conditioned by what we have, but the situation that we are living. So the definition

178
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,900
of what kind of a communal society will be, you know, is something that is a process,

179
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,620
and it's something that can be defined only in a process of struggle, and in a process of struggle,

180
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:48,580
and the coming together of different struggles across the globe, because there's not one model,

181
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,820
as Massimo de Angelis has written over and over and very eloquently, the idea

182
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:02,260
that, you know, in this great globe, Asia, Africa, with different history, different climatic

183
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:10,180
situations, different trajectories, that there could be a model of commons, that this is

184
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:18,740
unthinkable. Like the Separatists say, many yeses, one no, no to the exploitation,

185
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,980
no to capitalism, and then many yeses, many roads, different roads, you know,

186
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,340
shaped by the historic trajectories, the historic struggles that people have made,

187
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:39,860
right? So this is very, very important, and I think, first of all, no to global commons.

188
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,900
There's no such a thing as global commons. Who's going to be the agent to make decisions

189
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,220
on a global level? We don't have a global subject. Now we have the UN, and we know what the

190
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:56,180
disaster the United Nations has been. So if we're talking about, and here we are already entering

191
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:02,820
the discussion of what is democracy. Democracy is the rule of the people. So how do people rule,

192
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,340
you know, who is the global subject, right? The idea of a global superstructure, this is what

193
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,420
capitalism has, has created, and we know what the global superstructure is. Capitalism is the

194
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:21,860
United Nations, which is really the, you know, institutional face of capital, international

195
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:30,340
capital. So no to that global idea of a global commons. I want to quote here, over and over,

196
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,620
Maria Mies, who just died, you know, a great feminist, one of the most lucid, powerful

197
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:44,340
anti-capitalist voices within the feminist movement. And she was very adamant about rejecting

198
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:52,340
the idea of the global commons, right? And so, you know, what we are talking about, you know,

199
00:21:52,340 --> 00:22:03,300
is instead replanting, you know, rerouting, you know, decision making, the construction of

200
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:11,460
community, you know, and the construction of commons, right, on localities, which doesn't mean

201
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,580
that they are fragmented, isolated, and unconnected. Absolutely not. And here I,

202
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:27,060
you know, I want to make reference, for instance, to what, you know, what we call Latin American was,

203
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:34,980
you know, before the conquest, before colonization, you know, when you had, you know, a vast world

204
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:42,900
all throughout, you know, from the south of the continent to the north, of local economies,

205
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:50,020
local society, and yet with a tremendous amount of exchange, with a tremendous amount of

206
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:57,700
interconnection, right? So it's not true that to think of local commons is to think,

207
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:05,620
you know, of isolation, of going back to the Stone Age. Not at all. Not at all. It means that

208
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:12,340
to have, for example, for instance, of confederacies of commons, you know, and of

209
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:19,540
course today we also, some of the technologies, some of the means that are in existence can also

210
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:27,380
be used, can also be used, but with great discrimination, with great discrimination.

211
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:36,180
And about digital commons. Well, digital commons, right? I'm always a bit hesitant

212
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:43,460
and skeptical, you know, before embracing them, because when I think of digital today,

213
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,220
I immediately think, you know, massacres in the Congo. This is what I immediately think.

214
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,500
Not only the Congo, but I'm thinking of lithium. I think, where's the lithium coming from?

215
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,300
Where's the coltan? Where's the real earth? Where are all the minerals?

216
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,140
And so far, you know, those minerals have been the disaster, have been the cause of wars,

217
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,500
have been the cause of massacres, have been the cause of recolonization of entire areas of the

218
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:18,580
world. So unless we find, you know, unless the question of not only what can be done with the

219
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:25,700
digital, but how the digital is produced, unless the question becomes central to the discussion on

220
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,740
digital commons, then I have to say, no, this cannot be the solution, because we have to

221
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:41,220
realize that behind much of the warfare and much of the predatory practices, the incredibly

222
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:47,620
predatory practices of international capital today, especially in Africa, Latin America,

223
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:54,980
there is exactly, you know, the need to feed this new technology, right? And unfortunately also,

224
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,260
you know, the new green technology, the one that is supposed to, you know, save the earth,

225
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:06,100
right? Which now depends on the production of billions of batteries, you know, for electrical

226
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,420
cars. Where are those batteries going to go? In which ocean? In which fields? Who is going to be

227
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,540
the beneficiary of all that poison that is going to leak out of those batteries?

228
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,220
So I think we have to be careful with the digital commons. And I think we need instead to see what

229
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,860
gives power back to community, back to the people who are knowledgeable about the condition of the

230
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,860
earth, of the soil, and the condition of the social relation of the places in which they live.

231
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:45,140
I mean, it's also the construction of humanity. You know, we are becoming, and now we're AI,

232
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,540
and you know, we are becoming zombies. We are really, you know, artificial intelligence is a

233
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:59,060
big problem. The problem is also the mechanization of human beings. The mechanization of human beings.

234
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:09,780
I'm really flabbergasted about how much, you know, population that seem to have all this power,

235
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:19,860
the computer, the little phone, and so on, you know, are in fact unable to really impact

236
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:28,340
in a significant way the politics, you know, of international capital. And at times,

237
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:37,460
I even think that precisely access to these gadgets, you know, have in a sense put back the

238
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:46,420
struggle, dozens and dozens of years. In other words, the capitalism, you know, with the computer,

239
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:54,420
with the iPhone, the iPad, and all of that, you know, as pacified, as succeeded in pacifying,

240
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:03,780
and giving people assimilated of a power that in fact we don't have. Yes, we can call this,

241
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:10,820
yes, we can call that, but actually decisions are being made that are extraordinary, extraordinary.

242
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,100
We have people in the streets in New York. We have people dying in the streets in New York.

243
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,820
We have the largest incarceration, the larger number of people incarcerated. This society,

244
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:29,940
which is, you know, the leading capitalist society, presumably in prosperity, you know,

245
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,780
is a society where people are dying in the street, where we have the life, where people have been

246
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:44,980
executed with summary processes, you know, not to mention, not to mention, you know, the 800 jails

247
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,100
that the US is running across the world, the military intervention in much of the world,

248
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,460
and we are not able to stop it. And so I've been wondering how much this technology,

249
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:05,780
which has been thrown at us and made more available, has also given this pseudo-empowerment,

250
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,940
pseudo-empowerment, and I'm not saying that there are not advantages to it,

251
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:18,340
right, but certainly we are very unaware on a day-to-day basis of the cost of this technology.

252
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,860
We don't know whose fields have been expropriated in order to create the iPhone,

253
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,180
right, that we use on a day or the computer that we use. We are totally unaware of that.

254
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:37,380
So the distancing also, the capitalism has produced the distances of the places where

255
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,620
things are extracted, where things are produced, and where things are consumed.

256
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:49,060
That distances that makes us irresponsible, responsible and irresponsible, right? It's

257
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:55,700
really a serious problem. So we need actually to bring together production and consumption

258
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:04,340
so that we know, that we know if the oranges we eat, if the clothes that we wear have caused

259
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:13,460
somebody's blood, have caused somebody's life, have caused somebody's loss of land and forced

260
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:22,660
migration. Yeah. Let's maybe dig a little deeper into that because this idea of bringing together

261
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:30,180
production and reproduction, or maybe in other terms transcend this idea of separation of spheres,

262
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:36,020
this is really important, I think, as you already pointed towards right now. I would

263
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:43,380
be interested in what this might look like in connection to this question of organization,

264
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,420
because you refused this idea of a global commons that would have a form of meta-organization,

265
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:56,820
so to speak, but you also pointed out that there will be quite a lot of coordination going on

266
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,500
between the different commons. So maybe we can cross these two. Then the question would be,

267
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:11,380
what would a form of organizing a mode of reproduction, so to speak, what would that

268
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,900
look like when these separations of spheres of production on the one side and reproduction

269
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:27,860
on the other is overcome? So how to organize a, let's say, mode of reproduction between these

270
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:35,540
different commons and projects and whatever entities there might be to coordinate with?

271
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:43,300
Yeah. This, of course, again, that cannot be a universal model. I mean, I imagine if you are

272
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:49,060
living in Eskimo land or if you're living in Mozambique, there are very different

273
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:55,220
possibilities, right? I'm thinking, for instance, in pre-Columbian America, the example of Peru,

274
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:02,820
you know Peru is a very elongated territory, and that elongated territory made for very different

275
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:12,020
types of cultivation, very different types of cultivation. So Peru, before the conquest,

276
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:22,020
was very alive, was an intricate system of exchanges that enabled people within a limited

277
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:29,700
territory after all, you know, to in fact benefit, you know, from production coming from different

278
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:36,740
areas, from different types of production. And, you know, of course, now we are in another world,

279
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:44,580
but this is something that now we can think of, right? In other words, when I was speaking of,

280
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:53,380
you know, the Confederacy of Commons, you know, I think that this also has implications on the

281
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:01,300
condition of production, which means that exchanges, yes, but not exchanges, you know,

282
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,820
you go to a supermarket today and, you know, perhaps the fish in the United States, you know,

283
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:13,860
may be coming from Africa or may be coming from across the world. And it's different if the fish

284
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:22,900
may come from Long Island or from areas. And so where, in fact, the possibility of the economic

285
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:31,060
exchange, right, is not only an ecological disaster as it is today, all these boxes,

286
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,980
all these boats, all these that are really destroying the planet,

287
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:45,940
but also allows for the circulation of human relations, so that you know the people from

288
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:54,100
which the food is coming. They are actually human social, cultural interchanges. This is a kind of

289
00:32:54,100 --> 00:33:00,260
world that we want to reconstruct. And today we have in a very atomic form, you know, with the

290
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:08,020
community-supported agriculture, for instance, as a little, as a microcosm, right? But when you look

291
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,740
and analyze it and you expand it, as if on a computer, and you expand it, then you see that

292
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,980
what is being exchanged, you know, is not only the food, what is being brought to the city from

293
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:27,620
the farms and so on. It's not only the food, but there is also a whole set of relations, right?

294
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:33,060
People are getting to know, yeah, who are the producers. You begin to develop a relationship

295
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:40,420
of trust, right? You begin to understand more about what is actually being produced, you know?

296
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:47,060
What are the vegetables of this season? You don't have these, you know, plastic enveloped,

297
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:55,620
you know, universal, ever-present, you know, ever-available, you know, food production,

298
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:01,540
no? But you actually begin to understand. So there is a richness that we have lost.

299
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:08,020
There is a richness of, and I think of that way, I think of the way of expanding scale,

300
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,940
you know, every different modalities, obviously, depending on, you know, communities on the

301
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:21,380
mountains, communities on the sea, you know, but something along those lines, you know, it's,

302
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:32,100
I think, and I come back to my original point that much of this is also something that we learn

303
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:39,060
in the process of the struggle, which is, has to be a process of construction,

304
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:46,500
not just resistance, but construction, experimentation. The struggle is a moment

305
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:53,060
not only to say no, but to experiment with alternative. From the beginning, there is no

306
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,580
real struggle unless it is accompanied by an immediate transformation of relation among the

307
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,780
people who are doing the struggle. Unless the struggle immediately constructs something new.

308
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,260
It's not just a no, but it's a yes to a different kind of social relations.

309
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,500
Maybe we can carve out...

310
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,820
I say the commons are a condition of the struggle, are a condition of the social

311
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:24,020
transformation. They are not just the goal, the objective of the social transformation.

312
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,900
They are the conditions. They are the ones that make it possible.

313
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:36,500
Yeah, and I mean, I think even though you kind of are a bit hesitant to reach too far ahead in

314
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,420
order not to prescribe some form of model or something like that, I still think that there are

315
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:52,820
some, let's say, maybe basic coordinates that can be distilled from this type of approach. So,

316
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,820
one you just pointed towards, it's not just about resistance, but also about construction.

317
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,140
Maybe one might say creative construction, experimental construction.

318
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,140
I think there are some basic coordinates that one might distill from this approach.

319
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:18,900
For example, as I pointed towards earlier, this question of labor and whether or not in alternative

320
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,940
modes of, in this case, modes of reproduction, one would want to reproduce this category of

321
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,340
labor or not. Because within the models of democratic economic planning that I engage with,

322
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,620
oftentimes these socialist models of democratic planning that I know, they usually tend to

323
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:47,220
reproduce and maintain this category of labor along with a form of remuneration that is paid

324
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:53,540
in exchange for work. So, this remuneration is, of course, not a classical wage relation then,

325
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:59,940
because it doesn't involve a surplus that is going to a capitalist. But still, the category of labor

326
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,780
as such and this exchange relation in the form of work for pay tends to be reproduced. I would be

327
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,860
interested in how you think about this, because within these models, at least, the rationale,

328
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:20,180
the argument of the people developing these models is kind of along this traditional idea of

329
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:26,340
two-phase model developed by Marx in the Goethe Program, where the idea is that you would have to

330
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:34,660
have a first phase where this connection between work and pay is still in place. And then afterwards,

331
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:42,340
you would have the ability to come to a second phase. But this all rests on this idea of progress

332
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:49,940
that you, of course, reject. So, I assume you would reject this two-phase model as well and the idea

333
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:57,620
of continuation of labor as a category as such as well. Am I right in assuming that?

334
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,300
So, it's a long story. Too much.

335
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:08,900
A lot of things. No, I disagree. The idea of the two-phase is not the idea of progress.

336
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:21,060
I just, the idea of progress is the ideas of this almost natural development that is attributed

337
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:30,580
to social. It's a way of naturalizing social relation and particularly capitalist relation,

338
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:36,500
right? Inevitably. So, the old is bad and we're going towards the new and the new, of course,

339
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:43,140
and also the connection with technology. No, labor. First of all, the distinction,

340
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:50,100
I think also in Marx, labor and work, right? The idea of labor implies exploitation. Labor implies

341
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,340
exploitation. So, I think there's a difference between labor and activity, right? Activity,

342
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:03,700
creative activity, self-determined or collectively self-determined. Not individually, but activity

343
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:09,780
that is very different from labor which is done under somebody else's, you know, decision-making,

344
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:17,460
et cetera, right? So, I think in terms of the transition and the question of money,

345
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,820
you know, I think in terms of a transition and I faced this issue so many times because there was

346
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,740
a time in my life I was involved in a feminist international organization called Wages for

347
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:39,380
Housework and we were accused of institutionalizing women in the home. We were accused of

348
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:46,900
confirming capitalism, monetizing the only sphere of life in which, you know, love, et cetera, et

349
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:53,380
cetera. And I famously, you know, thought that, you know, famously because that has been the most

350
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:59,380
popular things I've said in my life. Yeah, you know, they call it love. We call it unpaid labor.

351
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:09,460
And I still stay behind it. I still subscribe to it. So, the question of money. The question of

352
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:21,940
money is two points I want to make. Number one, struggle for monetary compensation. It's inevitable

353
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:32,500
until we can change the power relation between workers and capital because as long as we do not

354
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:40,900
re-appropriate the material condition of our reproduction, then we need to use money. Otherwise,

355
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,580
we die. The Zapatistas who have been, you know, the group of people, to my knowledge, who have

356
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:58,660
been most advanced in refusing monetary relation, they still use some money. They sell coffee for

357
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:07,380
monetary compensation because they have not been able yet to create all the material condition

358
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:14,100
of reproduction that are necessary without some money. So, as long as we are in a society

359
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:22,900
where the capitalist class still monopolizes, you know, much of the material condition, the land,

360
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:30,260
the soil, the waters, the technology, et cetera, et cetera, money is both a way of guaranteeing

361
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:39,460
some reproduction and also sucking wealth away from the capitalists. Obviously, that struggle

362
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:45,060
is not the struggle that is going. It's a struggle that is necessary, but it's also a

363
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:52,340
struggle that has to be accompanied by many, many, many other, you know, struggles. It's not this,

364
00:41:52,340 --> 00:42:01,460
the main road, you know, to revolution. But we cannot say, and I used to, my response to people

365
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,980
who were critical of wages for households was to say, well, very good. Give up your wage. You are

366
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:14,180
teaching a university. Give up your wage. Liberate yourself from this bondage to capitalism. Work

367
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:20,260
for free. Of course, nobody has done that. Of course, you've been conceivable, you know. So,

368
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:26,980
I found the hypocrisy, the double standard. You know, I found that, you know, once again, yes,

369
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:34,340
you know, women's work in the home is treated as something very different. And no matter how much

370
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:42,340
you show that is the foundation for every labor activity, that is work that is exploited by

371
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:48,740
capital, is work that produces accumulation, creates work, blah, blah, blah, blah, etc. And

372
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:56,180
that has put women in the condition of, you know, having to accept any wage once they went out of

373
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:05,060
home. So, I think the money, you know, there is a phase of struggle. And that phase of struggle,

374
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,500
the goal of it is to change the poverty relation and reappropriate. So, to me, the goal of our

375
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:22,180
struggling every, every moment, every place, every moment is reappropriate, you know, the wealth

376
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,580
that has been produced, the wealth that we are producing, you know, control, I mean, land,

377
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:35,060
the issue of land, millions of people, land, land, land, land means everything. Land means trees,

378
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:43,060
land means waters, you know, land means, you know, leaves, medical roots,

379
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:51,060
land has such, is such wealth that when you lose your wealth, land, you lose much more than

380
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,900
physical sustenance, you lose a culture, you lose knowledges, you lose a tremendous amount of

381
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:07,460
knowledge when you lose the land. So, that process, you know, and I think in terms of

382
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:14,500
a future society, you know, in terms of, I think of a society without money or with money,

383
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:23,540
but money, see, that's the issue. What is money? And I'm thinking, I'm now, this is the issue of

384
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,100
money is really matching my mind because I'm really interested in the relation between women

385
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:36,980
and money. You know, what has been historically women? Yeah. And, you know, I have this book in

386
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:44,580
mind, which is called Women, Money and the Devil, that, you know, begins with the pact on the devil

387
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:51,060
between the witch and, you know, the devil gives her money. And then of course she, she's desperate,

388
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:58,980
you know, and she's, you know, screaming to her misery, he comes, give us some money.

389
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:06,020
And eventually, of course, has become my servant, I'll solve your problem. It's a very marital deal,

390
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:16,260
totally marital. And then she copulates with him. But within a few days, the money has given her

391
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:23,700
turns into ashes. This has intrigued me. In many demonologies, you find that detail.

392
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:31,780
And this has intrigued me immensely. Why? Even once they made the pact, even when they sold their soul,

393
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:40,420
women could not keep the money. Even when they sold their soul, capitalism has instituted this

394
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:48,580
incredible incompatibility between women and money. But aside from this, money has existed. I

395
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:56,260
visited many years ago with my partner, we visited the first place in Turkey. And right now I don't

396
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:02,980
have the, I don't remember the name. Yeah, but it's a famous place, but 3000 years ago,

397
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:11,380
the first coins were minted. 3000 years ago. But money had a very different function

398
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:21,140
than capitalist money. Money had ceremonial function, money sometimes served, so you didn't

399
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:29,780
want to bring, to move cattle, et cetera, et cetera. So you'd use the money as a substitute

400
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:38,340
for the transportation of goods. But money is different in capitalism and begins to function

401
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:49,300
capitalistically only when you have a society where people have been expropriated from the

402
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,740
capacity to reproduce themselves. At that moment, money function a different way,

403
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:03,460
right? At that moment, money is not just exchange. Money becomes an instrument of exploitation.

404
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:09,780
It becomes an instrument of, because then those people can be forced to work,

405
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:16,980
can be forced because their sustenance belongs to them. The moment that whatever allowed you to

406
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:25,300
survive is sucked away from you, then money becomes really the way that basically takes your

407
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:31,860
blood away, can take your blood and your life away. So I think it's very important. So when we say

408
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,300
there will be a future without money, maybe there will be money, but we will be functioning in a

409
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,900
very, very different way. Maybe it will be like maybe a token that you go to a movie theater

410
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:49,060
and you have a token that you show and with that token you enter the, you know,

411
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:57,460
you can enter, gives you the right to enter it. But I agree with Mark's view that the last,

412
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:06,980
you know, communism as from each according to their ability and to each according to their need

413
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:15,460
and decision made by the association of the community. That to me, it's a good model to look

414
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:22,500
at and what could be a money, but certainly not money. Money will not be able to function

415
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:29,700
because it will be a society in which the wealth, the material condition of reproduction

416
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,620
will be accessible to everybody in the community.

417
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:44,660
And that's the basis of democracy. A democracy without that access is nothing. It's a world as

418
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:50,340
it has become. Today the market, you know, the big democracy of the United States, we have people

419
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:57,940
sleeping in the street, you know, where you have, you know, pharmaceutical companies, you know, who

420
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:05,380
have killed the millions of people with this, you know, narcotic medicine and so on, you know,

421
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:12,580
can go scoff free by paying a few, a billion dollars and are not held to the same standard,

422
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:20,420
you know. So you can go to jail for 20 years, you know, for a little theft, but you have big companies

423
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,820
who are devastating the life of people. So that's not democracy.

424
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:34,180
I just wanted to maybe clear up a form of misunderstanding that might be in place,

425
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:39,460
because I just wanted to state that I'm absolutely with you that within a, like,

426
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:46,900
let's say early transition phase or within the immediate future, it's of course necessary to

427
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,860
fight for higher wages and not kind of dismiss money as something that we would not need in order

428
00:49:53,860 --> 00:50:00,740
to live within the context that we live in right now. The thing is that within these models that

429
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:07,780
I study, these models for democratic economic planning, they argue that even though a situation

430
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:15,060
is already in place in which there is democratic control over the economy, that still then there

431
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:22,980
would need to be some form of connection between work and pay in place in order to, let's say,

432
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:29,780
discipline its subjects, at least for a certain period of time, because it is assumed that this

433
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:37,700
would still need to be necessary, actually at the end, for reasons of efficiency, so to speak,

434
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:45,860
you know. So in order to be able to reproduce a certain type of wealth in material terms,

435
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:51,300
it would still be necessary to, you know, have these mechanisms in place. And that's why I said

436
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,540
there is a connection between this idea of a two-phase model and this idea of progress,

437
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:04,900
because then the argument is essentially we do not yet have enough capacity when it comes to

438
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:12,260
the forces of production in order to have full communism. And until then, we would need to kind

439
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:18,340
of discipline our subjects in order to get to this place of fully developed forces of production.

440
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:23,140
And that's why I meant that there is a certain connection between the two ideas, you know.

441
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:32,820
I understand, but I'm very suspicious of the discipline. Who's going to do the discipline?

442
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:42,500
Who's going to be disciplined? So that to me, that plan, that democratic planning is not something

443
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:50,180
that I would, you know, sign up for, because when I hear discipline, all my, you know,

444
00:51:51,140 --> 00:52:00,020
practice say run for the gun when you hear these words, because very dangerous. This sounds like

445
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:06,980
capitalism. You need to actually whip people to work, decide who's valuable, who's not valuable,

446
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:17,140
and reproduce, you know, the whole mark, as Mark should say, the hierarchies, the control system,

447
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,620
the two-tier society. That's exactly what we are fighting against.

448
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,300
Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I think the people developing these models, they would, of course,

449
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:34,100
argue that there is a base income for everybody. And on top of that, you would have these

450
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:40,980
remuneration schemes that would allow to, as I said, kind of discipline its subjects.

451
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:48,420
I think they wouldn't call it disciplining. In my eyes, it is still disciplining, and I'm against

452
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:56,260
this kind of approach, but I just have to be fair in terms of showcasing their arguments for that.

453
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:01,780
And there's another argument that maybe complicates the whole thing a bit more,

454
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,460
and this argument is actually coming from a feminist perspective, in which the argument

455
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:16,260
goes that within a totally voluntarist societal organization, there might be a danger of running

456
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:25,380
into a situation where, again, people who are most vulnerable are kind of having a worse situation

457
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:31,300
when trying to organize this reproduction of societies. In this feminist critique,

458
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,620
I think the argument would be that the transparency that comes along with forms of remuneration and a

459
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:46,020
general obligation to work is seen as a guard against a continuation of unjust relations

460
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:51,220
in the sphere of reproduction within post-capitalist configurations. So this would be,

461
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,620
I think, the argument. I don't see anything

462
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,940
voluntaristic in what I'm talking about. I'm not seeing anything. I'm seeing a transformation

463
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:03,460
of social relation that occurs in the process of the struggle. I mean, look, if we want to look,

464
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:10,180
for instance, at societies that are running now on a more communal system, right? I mean, yeah,

465
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:18,900
look, there is a Guatemalan-taken feminist who has written a very beautiful book,

466
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:27,060
Gladys Tsutsun, where she discusses what has been the history and the organization

467
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:35,540
of communal work, society, of Totonicapan, which is in the Highlands of Guatemala.

468
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:41,860
And she describes a situation where there is a culture, there is a collective agreement.

469
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:47,140
Collective agreement, because it's stipulated through assemblies, is the assembly. The assembly

470
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,580
is the whole. You make the decision, but you have to contribute to the reproduction of the society.

471
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:59,780
So you may call that disciplining, but the fact is that you cannot, if you don't actually,

472
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:06,260
there is a general agreement that in order to keep the society going, something, you know,

473
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:11,780
you have a little responsibility, you have to do something, you know? And even if you migrate,

474
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:18,340
even if you migrate, you have to have something. And even when you return as a migrant after many

475
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:23,700
years, you can return as a tourist or you can return as a participant. Participating means that

476
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:30,100
you begin to take responsibility again. That seems to me very, very fair, very democratic.

477
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:36,660
By the time you are a child, nine or 10, there's little things that you're given to do, and you're

478
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:43,140
understood that you're part of a collective and you have to do, etc. That seems to me as nothing

479
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:50,500
voluntaristic. There is nothing voluntaristic. It's a collective decision-making on the basis,

480
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:57,780
calculated on the basis of the resources that are available, not out of some imagination,

481
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:05,060
but on the basis of this is like a high mounting place, but where there is a culture of collectivity

482
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:12,020
and is a culture that gives a tremendous protection. You're not born in, you know,

483
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:18,820
that the community will support you and where there's an immense solidarity also with the

484
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:24,420
people who die. You know, the dead, there is a cult of the dead, the dead are present.

485
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:30,580
You know, as soon as somebody dies, there's enormous amount she described by everybody. So

486
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:37,540
the death is not as fear as the end. The sense of belonging to something is something that you

487
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:45,700
understand, extend your life beyond your physical life, which is a great sense of power. Instead of

488
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:52,340
the sense of desperation and finitude, thinking, oh my God, all is lost, because you are actually

489
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,060
part of a collective body. You're beginning to feel that there's a collective breath and a

490
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:04,900
collective body, very powerful. And, but there are, you know, from the very early age, the idea

491
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,860
that, yeah, you have to do something. And if you don't, if you don't do anything, then you should

492
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:14,420
not make the decision. You don't speak in the assembly unless you've done the work. I think

493
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:20,740
it's a great idea, by the way. I think it's a great idea that we should use and it's not

494
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:28,260
voluntaristic. Yeah, I understand. And, but would you say then that this is always tightly coupled

495
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:38,260
to a contextual idea of community? Because this agreement, so to speak, is more or less based on

496
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:47,300
rules that are part of a cultural socialization, so to speak. And do you think that this can be

497
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:56,180
achieved in larger context as well, or in a really large scale context as well? Or does it need to be

498
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:06,340
kind of more or less tied to a community that has a certain size and is therefore able to,

499
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:14,020
let's say, put practice behind this ideal so that it is not just an abstract rule?

500
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:19,380
Yeah, but this is the idea, right? First of all, I think there's a struggle also in these

501
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,260
indigenous communities, and what I understand talking to women from indigenous communities,

502
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:31,220
to expand the community so that, for example, people who are not being raised in that culture

503
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:38,980
can also be part of it, for example, through marriage and other forms. And so these communities

504
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:46,980
are not frozen. And I think that the women are, in fact, the most important agent of change.

505
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:55,540
But this goes back to the idea of how to be organized, because if we are talking about real

506
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:02,900
democracy and people making decisions about their life, then there has to be a certain rootedness

507
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:09,060
in the sense that you have to know your locality. You have to know the possibilities.

508
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:14,500
You cannot make decisions for places far away for the fishermen when you are in the mountain.

509
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:22,020
So the idea of the Confederacy, the idea of exchanges, the idea of, you know, what I was

510
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:29,700
talking before, you know, the assembly might be a thousand people, but then you connect with the

511
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:36,500
assembly right all across the highlands of Guatemala. It doesn't mean that because,

512
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:43,300
you know, you have a decision making by a community which is somewhat limited in size

513
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:56,580
and has commitment that relate to all kinds of decision and cultural practices that date from,

514
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:05,620
doesn't mean that you don't also open to other similar communities and that you don't have

515
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:12,420
exchanges. The question is when you begin to have a decision making that is removed

516
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:19,780
from the people who are actually suffering the consequences of that decision making.

517
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:27,300
And here we cannot have it two ways. If you want to be in control of the consequences

518
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:34,020
of decision making, then you cannot make decisions on a global level. I cannot decide for people in

519
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:42,260
Patagonia. I cannot make decisions for people that cry. I can struggle with them when they ask me

520
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:49,620
solidarity to fight against fracking in Patagonia. I can struggle with them, but I cannot make

521
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:55,460
decisions for the people in Patagonia. And we don't have got to go as far as Patagonia, but I mean,

522
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:04,660
I cannot make decisions for people in Colorado or in Alabama, right? But I can struggle with them

523
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:11,300
because obviously we'll have similar conditions, et cetera, et cetera. And we have those agreements.

524
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:17,220
So I think that this is what we have. And of course, back to the original point,

525
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,300
that the struggle is the gray field of experimentation and the gray field of

526
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:29,460
transformation. This change to this new society, to a society where we have this culture, where

527
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:36,020
we have this commitment, where we have this solidarity, it's going to be a tremendous

528
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:43,220
process of transformation. We all carry a lot of capitalism within ourselves. The struggle does

529
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:49,140
not only transform the world, but has to transform who we are. There's one question I ask all of my

530
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:54,500
guests at the end, and this is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

531
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:03,860
What is the alternative? I have to be joyful. I have to be joyful because I'm like, you know,

532
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:15,460
I often quote a poem, a poet from Greece, 1300 BC, 1000, Mimmo Nermo. He wrote something that I

533
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:24,900
learned as a, you know, a young person and stayed with me. Life is a tragedy, it's a comedy or a

534
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:34,180
tragedy. And you either learn to laugh of the most great sufferings, or you'll forever cry.

535
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:43,860
You know, and it's not laugh, but it's an affirmation of life. It's an affirmation of life.

536
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:52,100
And here I want to end quoting Maria Mies, quoting Maria Mies, my great sister who died,

537
01:02:52,740 --> 01:03:00,340
and it's been a great pain to lose her. And she used to tell the story, she was full of life,

538
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:08,900
life-affirming person, very creative, very life-affirming. And she used to think of her

539
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:16,260
mother, who at the end of World War II, when the whole world in Germany, you can imagine,

540
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:23,380
right, in ruin, in front of a life of ruin, she pulled up her sleeves and, you know,

541
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:30,740
this was a peasant community and bought a few piglets and said, well, life has to go on,

542
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:40,660
I still have to feed my children. And this, you know, in Ecofeminism, a book that she wrote

543
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:47,460
with Vandana Shiva, in the introduction to it, you know, there is a beautiful, beautiful sentence

544
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:53,060
that I almost memorize, I see if I can, you know, it says that when in this world,

545
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:59,460
in this world of capitalism, that is devoted, seems to be devoted to the destruction,

546
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:08,180
to such a destruction of nature and human life, our world can be summed up in terms of a struggle,

547
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:15,220
you know, to nourish, to nourish the impulse, the great impulse, which is in every living thing,

548
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,100
which is the impulse to reproduce themselves, which is in how to live, to continue.

549
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:30,340
And this is what, you know, I, this is what makes me, makes me, gives me joy, is to see

550
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:38,020
that we have to start with what is living, with what is moving, with what the new children are

551
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:45,380
born every day. What do we say to them? Oh, too late, too late. Capitalism is destroyed

552
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:51,620
too much, but they are born now. So we have to give them something. Wonderful. Sylvia,
