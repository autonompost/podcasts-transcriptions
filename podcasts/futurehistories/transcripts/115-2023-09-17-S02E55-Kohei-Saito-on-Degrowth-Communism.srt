00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and it is my great pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,440
Kohei Saito in today's episode.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,000
Kohei is professor at the University of Tokyo.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,180
He writes with spectacular success about degrowth communism and very recently a German translation

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,200
of his book has been released by DTV under the title Systemsturz, der Sieg der Natur

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,960
Ã¼ber den Kapitalismus.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:36,200
I was very lucky to catch Saito at the Viennese Volksstimmenfest and he was very spontaneously

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,840
willing to record an episode of Future Histories the next day.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,080
Before we start, I would like to welcome Daniel, Jakob and Christoph as patrons of Future Histories

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,880
and I would like to thank Lukas and Wilfried for their kind donations.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,640
And now, please enjoy today's episode with Kohei Saito on degrowth communism.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Welcome Kohei.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Thank you for invitation.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
Well, it's an absolute pleasure.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,600
Kohei, you have coined the label degrowth communism and it seems to be a very effective and kind

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
of provocative tool.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,880
Maybe for those who don't know about it, what is degrowth communism?

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,720
Okay, so what I try to do in my book is basically if you want to really be serious about climate

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,280
crisis, you have to be anti-capitalist.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,680
Capitalism, I don't think, can solve climate crisis by simply investing in renewable energies

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,840
and electric vehicles because capitalism is a system of constant expansion, constant valorization,

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,760
which is always accompanied by the increase of energy and resource usage.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:59,200
So the new technology try to decouple the economic growth from usage of energy and resources,

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,020
but it hasn't been sufficient and it won't be because this system of constant accumulation

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,620
will always demand excessive production and consumption in order to keep this system going.

26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,680
So I advocate degrowth communism and this has two aims.

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,280
One is basically communism or any socialists need to learn from degrowth side.

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,920
It's tradition, especially I come from the Marxist background, it's characterized by

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,840
a kind of productivism, you know, more technologies will be good.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,240
It will bring many things to working class and also it will prepare the foundation for

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,720
new society and so on and so on.

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,400
But I argue that this optimism is not valid anymore, especially in the face of ecological

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
crisis.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,960
So I think communists or socialists side have to accept this idea of degrowing, which actually

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:04,680
means not about going back to, you know, pre-modern, go back to nature kind of things, rather it

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,400
first asks to abandon GDP as a measure of progress, but at the same time, it also demands

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,440
to reduce what is unnecessary.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
There are many excessive things, as I said, so why don't we reduce them?

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,800
Because they are not really contributing to our well-being and they also destroy the planet

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,160
and so on.

41
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,120
And however, degrowth side should also learn from communist side, because some degrowth

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,440
people are not so explicit about overcoming or criticizing capitalism.

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,600
But I think degrowth capitalism cannot be possible because, as I said, capitalism is

44
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
simply about growth, right?

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,720
So if we really want to have degrowth, we need to challenge the market system, the price

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,600
mechanism and private property and that kind of things.

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,080
So in the sense that the degrowth also can learn a lot from the socialists side, so I

48
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,680
just try to combine both of them and degrowth communism, which actually has been quite successful

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
in Japan.

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
Right, not only in Japan, I have to say it has been quite successful as a discursive

51
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,000
carrier far beyond Japan, I have to say.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,520
So maybe let's talk about your engagement with the theory of metabolism, which is very

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,920
foundational for your perspective, I think.

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,840
So what does the theory of metabolism entail and what are the different layers to it?

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,000
And maybe what role does it play for your thinking about post-capitalism?

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,320
So when I talk about degrowth communism, this is actually coming from Karl Marx.

57
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,400
So I even argue that Marx became a degrowth socialist, a degrowth communist in the end

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
of his life.

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,760
In order to reach this point, I think this theory of metabolism is quite important.

60
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,680
So this also this theory and concept of metabolism, Stoffbeck says, comes from Karl Marx.

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,420
His point is quite simple.

62
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,000
He characterizes actually labor, the one of the fundamental category of his critical political

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,880
economy as the conscious mediation of human metabolic interaction with nature.

64
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,640
So human produces many things with certain aims and then they improve new technologies

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
and so on.

66
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,960
But this process is a kind of a circular process because human takes out of energy resources

67
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,880
from nature and they produce something and then they consume them.

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,620
And then there will be a waste of energy and resources, they go back to nature.

69
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,340
So this is a kind of circular process that is basically everywhere, anywhere in the time

70
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,340
of history.

71
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,740
So as long as humans live, this process of metabolism will continue.

72
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,140
We cannot ignore this.

73
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,420
And this is a natural law of our existence, I mean, any living being.

74
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,300
But the humans can consciously mediate this metabolism with nature.

75
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,260
But the problem is under capitalism, this metabolism is disrupted.

76
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,300
Marx called this disruption, metabolic lift.

77
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,380
And this is basically because capitalism tried to expand all the time and they tried to accelerate

78
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,500
at the same time, which creates a tension with this natural metabolism, which exists

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,260
independently and prior to capitalist accumulation.

80
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:43,140
For example, capitalism always tried to extract more resources and they tried to extract more

81
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,980
soil nutrition for the sake of food production.

82
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,500
And these kind of the process becomes much bigger and bigger for the sake of economic

83
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
growth.

84
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,940
But at the same time, it becomes faster.

85
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,540
They try to make many, many circuits so that they can have bigger profit.

86
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,860
And this creates a tension because the process of nature is much actually slower and it cannot

87
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,660
always catch up with the speed of acceleration of capital.

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:18,860
So when this tension becomes so high, there will be various contradictions such as soil

89
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,740
exhaustion, excessive deforestation, not leading to the desertification, but also the fossil

90
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:34,220
fuel has been extracted in such a speed that it is now creating, disrupting the earth system.

91
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,720
So leading to the climate crisis and so on.

92
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,560
So Marx's theory of metabolism gives us a basic idea of how capitalist production is

93
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,000
basically incompatible with this trans-historical law of humans and nature metabolism.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,520
Right.

95
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,960
And maybe to underscore this incompatibility, you can also explain the three shifts that

96
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,340
you introduced because you kind of lay out the argument that there are these three rifts

97
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,220
that capitalism brings about through its specific form of relating to this metabolism.

98
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,340
But then you also argue that there will be no way in which capitalism will be able to

99
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:23,500
fix this because it constantly instead shifts in order to kind of prevent a complete collapse

100
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,180
in the face of this metabolic rift.

101
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Yeah.

102
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,820
So what's interesting about Marx's theory of metabolic rift is that he's not like apocalyptic.

103
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,540
He's not saying that one day because of the metabolic rift, capitalism will collapse or

104
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,100
something like that.

105
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:46,260
Rather he's using this concept as an analytical tool, which means that he questions then why

106
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,740
capitalism actually survives despite this contradiction of metabolic rift.

107
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,420
His answer is basically the capital can always shift this contradiction to somewhere else.

108
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,640
The one easy solution is a new technology.

109
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,400
So basically when the soil get exhausted and the capitalist agriculture, they will introduce

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,120
a chemical fertilizer, for example.

111
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,680
But this chemical fertilizer is often produced by using fossil fuels.

112
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,040
So which leads to another problem like climate change.

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:29,160
So the problem is capital can use those technological shift in order to solve the soil exhaustion,

114
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,480
but it can only shift it to somewhere else by creating a new problem like climate change.

115
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,240
And there are also other ways of shifting the rift.

116
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,720
The other one he argues is spatial shift.

117
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,560
So which means that we have, for example, a lot of plastics.

118
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,000
Now we try to recycle, but it's just simply too many.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,920
So what happens is that under the name of recycling, these plastics will be shipped

120
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,480
to, like, for example, China or other Asian countries.

121
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:07,360
So the problem of plastics become invisible in the rich countries like Europe and Japan,

122
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,200
but simply because this waste has been carried out, carried away from somewhere to another place.

123
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
And this is a kind of the global north-south inequality.

124
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,800
And the problem is that by shifting spatially this metabolic lift,

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,000
the weaker, the marginalized, the periphery will suffer more.

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,160
So this has been very problematic already in the 19th century.

127
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,480
Marx is arguing about guano, the resources to gain the soil fertility.

128
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,960
But the problem is guano comes from Latin America.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,640
So although the resources will be simply extracted from Latin America,

130
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,840
the resources will be carried from the global south to England.

131
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,200
So this kind of center periphery contradiction is already dealt by Marx using this spatial shift.

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,880
And the third way of shifting the metabolic lift is a temporal one.

133
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
And that's what we see today in terms of climate change.

134
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,800
We emit a lot of carbon dioxide today, but we will not immediately suffer from the consequences.

135
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,680
Who will suffer? The later generations, the children today.

136
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,760
So the problem is those who are responsible today will not suffer the consequences.

137
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,240
The younger ones who are less responsible will suffer the consequences,

138
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,880
what we do right now because of this temporal shift.

139
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:45,960
So the shifting in these three ways always creates some room for capital to accumulate more wealth now.

140
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:54,480
But the problem becomes deeper and deeper in the future, also in the periphery and for the weaker and for the poor.

141
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,320
So this creates the question, so how do we actually solve this?

142
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:06,080
We really need to have a more just conception of taking the responsibility.

143
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,760
And so which means that we need to regulate the activities of big corporations.

144
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,200
We also need to tax the riches and then challenge the extreme concentration of the wealth.

145
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:23,400
And we also bring the view of the future generations in order to discuss these kind of issues.

146
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:31,160
And I think when we really bring these kind of aspects together, capitalism will be fundamentally challenged.

147
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:38,560
I think there will be some kind of the post-capitalist imaginary that is required in order to address these issues.

148
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,080
And I also need to practically introduce in this way.

149
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:53,120
Before we dig deeper into this political imaginary and the possible ways in which this relation can be formatted in a very different way,

150
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,480
I would like to ask one or two things about this whole complex of metabolism.

151
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:06,200
For example, I was asking myself, you seem to rely on a certain form of essentialism when it comes to what you call

152
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,400
primary level of the universal metabolic processes between humans and nature.

153
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,960
And from this primary level, one could then derive elementary requirements and so to speak, natural limits.

154
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,120
And I was wondering if this kind of conception might lead to some form of scientism in which it is kind of neglected

155
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,840
that these limits are also part of a process of negotiation and permanent scientific contestation.

156
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:41,360
So how is this border expressed, this kind of quote unquote natural limit and taken into account specifically?

157
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,080
Because I think there's no way around the idea that what counts as nature is constantly shifting and evolving

158
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:57,360
and that it is not a stable category in this sense, but must also be kind of renegotiated, so to speak.

159
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,840
This is a topic that I don't really discuss in the STEM Institute.

160
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:08,440
Rather, I discuss this issue in my another book, The Marks in the Anthropocene, which is actually a very important topic

161
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,680
because the recent academic popular discourse is rather characterized by a kind of monism.

162
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,880
As you said, what we conceive as a nature is at least not socially constructed,

163
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,200
but at least socially mediated by languages and powers and so on and so on.

164
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:36,400
So we can not have a kind of the rigid distinction between what is natural and what is social and so on and so on.

165
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:44,560
So even actually the metabolic rift is recently accused of falling into a kind of the dualist thinking.

166
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:55,560
People like Jason Moore actually criticized the concept of metabolic rift as Cartesian dualism of society and nature with capital S and N.

167
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,480
But I actually do not think so.

168
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:08,600
I argue in my book that the Marks was ontologically monist, but analytically or methodologically dualist.

169
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:17,520
So his theory of metabolism and his theory of materialism is basically about how humans are part of nature.

170
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:25,880
And they are, you know, also a constant part of this flow and the exchanges of resources and energy.

171
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:34,880
So in a sense, the ontologically, there is no absolute separation between humans and nature because, you know, humans are part of nature, as I said.

172
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,920
So there's some kind of continuity of nature and society, obviously, because society is also embedded in nature.

173
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,960
But that doesn't mean that we can not distinguish social and the natural.

174
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:59,640
Rather, I think it's very important to distinguish the natural and social because there are certain which recently called emergent properties,

175
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:08,600
which means that there are properties that do not exist in nature, that only exist in society or under certain social relations.

176
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,280
For example, take the concept of value.

177
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,200
If humans do not exist, the value, of course, do not exist.

178
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,120
So value is some kind of a social property, social category that only exists under social relation.

179
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,880
And, you know, if you look at other forms of society, it's possible that they don't have the conception of value.

180
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,480
Only under capitalism, value becomes such a central concept.

181
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,240
And then this value becomes the organized principles of metabolic interaction between humans and nature.

182
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:48,200
But value doesn't necessarily take care of all the dimensions or the complexity of this metabolism, because value is according to Marx.

183
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,120
It's just, you know, objectification of abstract labor.

184
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:00,800
So the mediation of metabolic interaction between humans and nature by value is from the beginning very one sided.

185
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:10,400
And this will create the kind of problems that I discussed as metabolic rift, because value is not concerned about sustainability.

186
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:18,720
Especially capitalism is only about increasing this object objectification of abstract labor, leading to this kind of contradiction.

187
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,800
And what's important is in also addressing this kind of metabolic rift, we also need to distinguish social and natural,

188
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,320
because what is social is something that we can also change.

189
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,360
We can change law. We can also change how we produce.

190
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,160
We can also change what we produce, because these are the social things.

191
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,280
But we cannot change, for example, the natural law.

192
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,080
For example, the ice melts at a zero degree Celsius.

193
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:57,120
And, you know, when with the carbon dioxide, the world temperature will rise.

194
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,440
And these are the natural process that we cannot change.

195
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,920
But we can change by using fossil fuels.

196
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,680
We stop that and then we will use something else that does not emit carbon dioxide.

197
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:17,280
So because this choice is actually social in the face of those natural laws that we cannot change.

198
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,920
So even in this very simple example, we already distinguish what is social and what is natural.

199
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:33,360
Otherwise, when we accept everything is sort of mixed, we cannot really decide what we can also change and what we cannot change and so on.

200
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:42,880
So I argue that this analytical distinction of society and nature is very fundamental for any critical discussion

201
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,120
of how we overcome capitalism and how we challenge this issue of climate breakdown and so on.

202
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,200
Very, very interesting. We don't have to get into this.

203
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,200
But my intuition would be that there is some kind of third way that there is a politicized new materialism, so to speak,

204
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:09,560
you know, where this idea of breaking down this dualism of nature and culture does not end up in some kind of relativism,

205
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:17,920
but indeed actually proposes a different kind of politicization, which would be quite close to what you're trying to argue for as well, I think.

206
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,920
So maybe just another thing on the metabolism and monism, because this I really didn't understand,

207
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,080
basically, because you kind of criticized a relational approach towards this question of metabolism.

208
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,760
And you do not only point towards the work of Jason Moore in this regard,

209
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,800
but you also point to works of, let's say, Bruno Latour and maybe one could add Donna Haraway or people like that.

210
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:50,200
And then you kind of try to couple them to a form of Promethean thinking that is actually found in left accelerationism.

211
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,280
But I would argue that these are very, very different types of paradigms.

212
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,920
So I mean, Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway, they would never kind of argue for geoengineering, for example.

213
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:10,160
So this is not really, at least in my interpretation, coming from the same paradigm as a source, I would say.

214
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,960
So this would also then lead to the question whether or not there is something to gain from a relational perspective

215
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,800
that does not actually go into some kind of left accelerationism, because this is something different.

216
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:31,240
So when Bruno Latour is criticized for falling into that kind of Promethean tendency,

217
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,200
is especially because of his association with the Breakthrough Institute,

218
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,760
which is advocating for a very eco-modernist kind of ideas like nuclear fusion and geoengineering and so on.

219
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:51,560
And Latour, of course, doesn't really endorse that kind of decision, the political choices in his work.

220
00:20:51,560 --> 00:21:01,920
But his famous Love Your Monster is about creating more intimacy of us humans and that kind of technologies,

221
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:09,000
instead of simply saying, oh, the technology that we invented is so dangerous, so why don't we just abandon them?

222
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,560
And that kind of thing is often characteristic to environmentalists or degrowth people.

223
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:25,680
And Latour kind of criticizes that kind of ideas and rather argues for embracing the more intimacy of humans and technology and so on.

224
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:34,080
But, you know, it's just one short piece of article, and then that doesn't necessarily represent everything about his theory, of course.

225
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,160
So I'm not saying that he's a left-wing accelerationist and that they are very different kinds of people.

226
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,800
And then Haraway obviously doesn't belong to that kind of a tendency.

227
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:55,400
However, at the same time, there's some danger in monism in the sense that when we really relativize what is social and what is natural,

228
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,760
we can easily say that there is no more nature.

229
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,400
So why don't we intervene more?

230
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,480
Because the more we intervene, it doesn't matter because it is already social.

231
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:17,480
So this kind of the sliding of the argument from the critical attitude towards a more uncritical endorsement of the status quo

232
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:26,960
and even advocation for the further intervention of social technology into the sphere of nature,

233
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,960
it's something that I find very dangerous today, especially because of the geoengineering and that kind of possibilities.

234
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:45,000
But at the same time, there's more fundamental problem to it because I think with the kind of monism, we cannot defend the humanism anymore.

235
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,360
And I characterize Marxism or Marx as a humanist thinker.

236
00:22:49,360 --> 00:23:00,120
So his idea of regulating metabolism and fixing this metabolic lift is about securing a kind of the sustainable condition for human development.

237
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,080
So it is about kind of a humanist idea of development and well-being and so on and so on.

238
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:15,400
But when we have a kind of monism, human loses the distinctive position in this kind of discourse and the vision of future.

239
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,360
So we can no longer say human values are important.

240
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,920
The human value needs to be centered on this kind of discussion for climate crisis and so on.

241
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,840
But I think we can never abandon anthropocentric view.

242
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:37,000
Even if we talk about other species, it's from our viewpoint and it's based on our knowledge of other species and so on.

243
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,240
So it is in some sense always anthropocentric.

244
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:49,800
And at the same time, when we talk about sustainability or environmental justice, these categories are also quite anthropocentric.

245
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,200
Not only what is sustainable is required for the sake of human prosperity.

246
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,320
Of course, it includes other species and so on.

247
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,000
But as I said, this is also conditioned by our view.

248
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,400
So I think it's really important to have some kind of the acceptance of inevitable anthropocentric.

249
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm not saying that humans are like exception.

250
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:23,360
So I'm against human exceptionalism, but I think we have to accept a weaker form of anthropocentric in a sense.

251
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,560
And then from that, we argue for sustainability, justice and that kind of things.

252
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,560
But that already requires a certain kind of distinction of human and non-human.

253
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:51,920
So inevitably dualism and even, you know, what I find a little bit weird is the fact that even like a post humanist and like a monist people are basically using the human language when they're talking for the human people.

254
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,800
They are not talking to other species. Right.

255
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:03,320
I mean, so this theory itself, they try to deny one of the central position of humans in terms of ideas, discourses and so on.

256
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,360
But they are basically working within the humanist category.

257
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:15,000
So I think that for the sake of protecting the nature and protecting the human development and so on, we need a weaker dualism.

258
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So that's my argument.

259
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:32,800
Very, very, very interesting, I have to say, because I mean, one position would be to say, well, that these forms of relationality actually aim towards different modes of relating to these spheres of reproduction

260
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:40,720
and cycles of reproduction that you also aim to kind of transform, not the cycles themselves, but the relation towards them.

261
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,720
And so I would kind of see a compatibility between these two end goals as well.

262
00:25:46,720 --> 00:26:02,160
But I totally understand your point about kind of not being able to leave a certain perspective that will always have to entail a human perspective as well,

263
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:15,280
because there's a certain gap within the theory on the relational part when it comes to, for example, like concrete proposals for a post human demos or something like that,

264
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:28,080
which would then be able to bring about a form of democracy that includes the post human, the more than human, because I was asking a couple of people on this podcast how one might think about this in very practical terms.

265
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
And it's like really difficult to come up with an answer.

266
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:42,960
But still, I mean, it's I'm still I would say kind of undecided if this still if this really means that there is nothing to gain from this strand, so to speak,

267
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:50,400
because I think specifically when it comes to this question of how we will and this is something you argue for as well,

268
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:05,280
how we will definitely have to change ourselves and our positionality towards the more than human in order to come to a point where this interaction with the metabolism is qualitatively different.

269
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,840
So there's there needs to be a kind of there needs to be some movement on the human part as well.

270
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:20,640
So we cannot stick to a strictly humanist perspective because we will have to be show some flexibility there as well.

271
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,200
And this is something you really point towards very vehemently.

272
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,560
So I see some conversion of the different positions there, I have to say.

273
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,920
So maybe let's try to change this last point into a question.

274
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:45,920
So what would then be a possible route to approach qualitatively different ways of engaging in this question of of metabolism?

275
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,440
How can we think about this relation in a in a really qualitatively different way?

276
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,480
The simple answer is degrowth.

277
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,800
So that's why I advocate for degrowth communism, because Marx was always, of course, communist.

278
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:09,320
But he was not so explicit about how the future society look like when it actually fix or repair this metabolic lift.

279
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,880
And he was quite vague about on that point in Capital.

280
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:20,440
So I started looking at his notebooks, especially because he didn't publish much after the volume one of Capital.

281
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:28,360
And the later stage of his life, he intensively studied natural sciences and pre capitalist societies.

282
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,040
But he didn't publish his results of research at all.

283
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:41,680
And so when we try to learn something from the late Marx, we have to look at these notebooks.

284
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:55,000
And I'm actually editor of Marx Engelsgesamt Ausgabe, which actually publishes this kind of notebooks that have been ignored even by researchers for many, many years.

285
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,480
And then one thing that I presented in my previous book, Karl Marx,

286
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:07,600
eco socialism is basically that Marx became quite ecological in his research on natural sciences.

287
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,720
He was concerned about soil exhaustion, deforestation, extinction of species.

288
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,080
And these kind of issues was quite central for his research on natural sciences.

289
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,040
But at the same time, he also studied pre capitalist societies.

290
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:34,560
And he looked at societies like Russia, India, and Latin America, Africa, and also even like Asian societies like Rome,

291
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,440
teutonic communes and other forms of indigenous people and so on.

292
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:52,840
And then he realizes that by looking at these communes and societies, they are quite equal, you know, it's a primitive communism.

293
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:00,240
So everyone is basically living on without hierarchy and they are, you know, quite equal and so on.

294
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,040
But at the same time, their communes, their communities were quite sustainable, long lasting.

295
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:15,800
And he used to despise this kind of the persistency of pre capitalist communes,

296
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:26,040
especially in his writings in the 1850s, he wrote quite negatively about Indian societies because it doesn't change, it doesn't develop,

297
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,400
it doesn't grow. So British colonialism, please come help them destroy the other communities.

298
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:38,360
And so that the British capitalism will be introduced in India and it will finally bring a revolution in India as well.

299
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,520
And that's very productive. But he changed his ideas in the 70s and 80s, rather correcting his earlier view,

300
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:55,840
because these society have some kind of economic superiority because it is more sustainable than Western capitalist societies.

301
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,360
So he accepted, OK, this persistency is actually something positive.

302
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,560
They don't seem to develop much. But at the same time, it means that super sustainable in the sense.

303
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:13,160
So he realized that this relationship, their relationship with nature is something very different from the capitalist relations,

304
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,120
metabolic relation with nature. So here comes in again, the dualism.

305
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,840
So metabolism with humans and nature is transhistorical.

306
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,320
Even pre capitalist non-Western society also organizes this metabolism.

307
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,680
They have to, but in a very different way than capitalism does.

308
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:38,600
And this organization is the basis for social equality and sustainability.

309
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:49,080
In conclusion, Marx actually wrote to better the switch, saying that the Western capitalism now facing to a very serious crisis today

310
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,760
needs to return to a higher form of archaic type of these communes.

311
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,200
This is how the Western societies, Western capitalism, can solve its own contradiction,

312
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,080
which means after looking at these notebooks on natural sciences and pre capitalist societies,

313
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:16,560
which means basically that Western societies have to make the metabolic interaction more sustainable and more equal

314
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:24,080
by accepting certain kind of the persistency and so certain kind of the steady state economy.

315
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,120
So that is why I argue that capitalism creates some tension.

316
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,040
It's irreparable and metabolic lift cannot be repaired.

317
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:39,880
But the socialism can repair this metabolic lift because in the end,

318
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,720
Marx realizes these Western societies will be also turned into a kind of degrowth society.

319
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:52,240
I think this is only the consistent way of understanding his struggle with his own ideas

320
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,480
about metabolic lift and historical materialism.

321
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Very interesting. But then still, I think the question remains,

322
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:06,040
is there a material foundation for this type of degrowth communism?

323
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,960
I mean, it's not only relevant when it comes to the question of how, for example, nowadays,

324
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,880
the global south might transition towards degrowth communism, but it's also in general a question, you know,

325
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:29,600
because also like hunter gatherer societies were only able to be egalitarian when people were able to kind of flee the collective as well.

326
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,400
And nobody was able to kind of monopolize the resources.

327
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,320
So there were always material conditions as well.

328
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,080
So what would then be the material conditions for degrowth communism?

329
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,000
I think it's more like a natural necessity coming from the planetary boundaries.

330
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,400
So that's where this social metabolism is conditioned by the law of nature, like planetary boundaries.

331
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:03,600
So we cannot actually have the social system that constantly try to expand and expand, expand, which is capitalism,

332
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:12,160
because capitalism now clashes with these planetary boundaries, creating various kinds of ecological crisis.

333
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,680
So what we are facing today is this task.

334
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:26,240
We need to consciously organize was consciously or socially regulate this metabolic interaction within planetary boundaries.

335
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,160
So this is we cannot. So, again, we cannot change planetary boundaries.

336
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,040
Planetary boundaries are there. And it is not neomarsathian or anything like that.

337
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,440
It's just pure scientific fact.

338
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,480
We can also develop some technologies to be more efficient and so on, but only within these planetary boundaries.

339
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:53,120
So I think when we accept this boundary and but, you know, there are also many social dimensions like what we produce,

340
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:59,920
how we produce within these boundaries and many social and related to power and hegemony and that kind of things.

341
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,480
But in any case, we can change this social dimensions only.

342
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,880
And then by remaining within the planetary boundaries,

343
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:17,320
I think we just have to have less consumption and less production of unnecessary things.

344
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,880
And it means that if we don't grow more in terms of economic terms, we don't produce more.

345
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,480
We have to share more things.

346
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,880
And this is why I think the idea of communism is very important for the growth,

347
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,640
because communism is about equal sharing and mutual aid and that kind of things.

348
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:42,920
And so I think the material condition is there in a rather in a way that we don't really want to.

349
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,440
But the planetary boundaries are there. And if you really respect them,

350
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:54,680
then we have to have that kind of the new very different ways of organizing metabolic interaction with nature.

351
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,480
And I think this is the degross is basically the only way.

352
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:07,040
And then it is not yet politically attractive because capitalism creates,

353
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:17,280
you know, our vision of abundance and good life and the luxury by producing and consuming more cars and flying more and,

354
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
you know, eating more beef or something like that.

355
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,520
But if we need to have that kind of the more sustainable transition,

356
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,880
I think we can start by, as I discussed yesterday in the folks to Memphis as well,

357
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:41,000
we can introduce some reform measures by banning private jets, maybe first.

358
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,480
And then also we ban other kinds of the other industries.

359
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,600
And then we also reduce other advertisements.

360
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:55,800
And these are the ways that we sort of socially also change our desires and what we want and our perception

361
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,840
of what is luxurious, what is fulfilling and so on.

362
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,760
These will gradually transform our ideas and attitude towards degross.

363
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:12,920
And it can have, after a certain point, a very radical movement.

364
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,280
They can find a very resonance in the various fields of social and environmental movements.

365
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,600
And I'm hoping that my book will lay the foundation for the kind of convergence of these two trends,

366
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,160
communist socialist trend and degross trend, because there has been quite antagonism among these schools.

367
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:40,840
And I'm hoping that this will be the first step to create a more meaningful dialogue and a common fight against the ecological crisis.

368
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,120
Yeah, fantastic. I think that's a very good project to pursue.

369
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:53,560
Still, I would have like a follow up question towards this complex of material preconditions, so to speak,

370
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:59,120
because specifically when it comes to this relation between the global north and the global south,

371
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:12,080
I mean, if degrowth people advocate for degrowth, usually they are very keen and rightfully so to also articulate that this means degrowth in the global north

372
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:21,040
and that they cannot and should not kind of dictate the global south to follow a certain path

373
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,720
that some Western intellectuals kind of pre-describe, so to speak.

374
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:38,280
And I mean, this gets also kind of more complicated since types of green capitalism engage in what Lula de Silva has recently called green neocolonialism.

375
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,720
You know, so there's this angle as well.

376
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:51,680
And so still, I'm wondering how this can be thought about if you think about degrowth communism for the global south.

377
00:38:51,680 --> 00:39:00,560
How much growth, so to speak, or which kind of growth is a possible way to pursue?

378
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:09,720
Or which kind of different forms of transition would the global south have to engage in differently than the global north?

379
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,320
Because these are different pathways.

380
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:18,120
You know, it's the old question, basically, of how can we get to communism not through capitalism?

381
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Exactly. This is what Marx was talking when he was discussing the issue of the Russian path to socialism.

382
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:36,080
And then many Marxists used to think that Russia must be also modernized and capitalized first so that they can build a socialist revolution later.

383
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:49,600
But then Marx's answer was actually different, that we can actually have a way that Russia can avoid a sort of Western industrialization under capitalism,

384
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:56,320
that they can build their own socialism based on the communes that they still had at the time.

385
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,320
So I think this question always still comes back today, what global south should do.

386
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:09,320
And I'm not, of course, saying that the global south should immediately make the transition to degrowth society and that they should just remain poor.

387
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:18,600
They need, obviously, in many areas, they need more education, they need more electricity, they need more clean water and so on and so on,

388
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:26,240
which means that they need a kind of the economic growth, obviously, because I'm not against satisfying people's need.

389
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:34,840
And for them, for that kind of growth is obviously something good and we should actually support them.

390
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:45,560
But after a certain point, growth doesn't necessarily improve our social well-being and it doesn't really bring happiness.

391
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,600
So the global north is especially excessive in that sense.

392
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:59,880
And I think even the green capitalism, if they try to keep growing in the future, there will be this kind of, yes, the green neocolonialism.

393
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:09,400
And then they will extract various resources from the global south and then that kind of unequal exchange will be strengthened.

394
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:22,520
So in order to avoid that, I think the only solution is, again, degrowth and the global north needs to sort of limit their own resource consumptions and so on.

395
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,280
And this is the only way we avoid the excessive extraction of resources from the global south.

396
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:37,640
And what's interesting is basically that I think one of the responsibility for the global north in making this kind of a transition to degrowth society is that

397
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,440
they need to redefine the concept of well-being.

398
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,720
They need to redefine the concept of abundance, as I said.

399
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:56,480
And then that will make these new ideas of abundance and the development and affluence more attractive even to the people in the global south.

400
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:04,520
I think this is one way. Of course, in this process, the people in the global north need to learn from people from the global south.

401
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,760
The concepts like Buen Vivir is obviously the most famous one.

402
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:23,720
But these concepts can be introduced among the societies in the global north to have a better idea of what we should actually produce and how we work and what we should spend in our free time and so on.

403
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:32,640
And but only by we actually, I think so in that sense, we have the very strong responsibility, especially when I write about this.

404
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:42,640
I have the Chinese society in my mind because when the Chinese society tried to be like American society, the things will be so bad.

405
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,720
But the Chinese people are actually trying to imitate the Western societies in many sense.

406
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:57,720
But this has been also creating some kind of antagonism and stress and suffering among Chinese people.

407
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:06,080
So I think with the Japanese people, Chinese people can together work on the new conception of, you know, good life and so on.

408
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:23,960
And these are the ways that we can actually learn from each other and then come up with a new idea or new forms of development that will be some kind of a common denominator for making just under sustainable transition to another kind of society.

409
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,440
And you use this term steady state economy.

410
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm just I would have to read up on it.

411
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:37,520
I have to say somehow this is for me associated with neoclassical economics, this idea of steady state economy.

412
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:46,840
And also, I'm asking myself, I mean, I'm sure that's not the way that you intended to to to to be like.

413
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:59,240
But somehow it kind of has this association of freezing in a certain moment of, quote unquote, progress and then just staying there.

414
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:07,360
But of course, we as humans, we we we would want to stay in a dynamic form of change, so to speak.

415
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,600
So we will want to continue to invent.

416
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:18,400
We would want to continue to to find different modes for producing different modes for whatever, for relating to each other and stuff like that.

417
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:29,680
So there's this kind of, I don't know, maybe conservative notion to this idea of steady state and maybe just some comments about it, because I'm sure that's not what you.

418
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:45,640
So I actually prefer the term degrowth to steady state economy, because steady state economy is associated with Herman Daly and his idea is not very anti-capitalist.

419
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:58,000
I mean, not at all. I mean, he said we can sort of use the market system and a system of private property once we have some kind of reformation on capitalist mode of production.

420
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:06,640
And it looks like, according to Herman Daly, as if steady state capitalism or something like that could be possible.

421
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,880
But I'm really against that kind of idea.

422
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:21,040
So, I mean, just sometimes I use the term, yes, a steady state economy, but not for the sake of defending that Herman Daly type of future society.

423
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,280
But simply, you know, to have some kind of idea that we don't necessarily pursue the constant growth anymore.

424
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,320
And that is objectively said, it's kind of a steady state economy.

425
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,440
So I don't mean more than that.

426
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:43,280
Yeah. Yeah. So it's just in the term, in the sense of like not to grow the energy throughput overall.

427
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:52,120
All right. So what I really like about your project is that it very offensively aims at trying to build up a new political imaginary.

428
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,640
I really, really like that.

429
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:05,160
And what you also emphasize within this project of building a different political imaginary is that planning will have to play a huge role in that.

430
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:17,320
So you say that social planning of production will need to be an essential part of kind of formatting this relation towards the metabolic interaction.

431
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:24,040
And since Future Histories has like really a couple of interviews engaging with the question of democratic planning,

432
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:30,280
I would very much hear your thoughts about this question of democratic planning and how we can bring it about.

433
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:39,320
I think that some of the proponents of the growth don't want to talk about planning because the planning is a little bit scary.

434
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:47,160
Planning immediately lead us to think about socialism in the sense of the Soviet Union.

435
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:58,840
So it's very central, bureaucratic and even inefficient system of a very authoritarian state, regulating the entire social production and so on.

436
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,520
But, you know, the socialist planning actually needs to be a democratic one.

437
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:10,760
It doesn't have to be centralized. It doesn't have to be authoritarian in any sense.

438
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:22,720
We can have more participation of the people and the workers in terms of deciding what we actually want to produce and what is actually shouldn't be produced anymore because they are excessive and so on.

439
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,440
And, you know, think about this kind of transition for a more decarbonized society.

440
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:35,640
We have to, at some point, need to decide not producing a car with gasoline.

441
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:47,720
So that's also one form of planning. But we cannot leave this decision to companies because they will try to produce a car with gasoline as long as they can.

442
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:54,960
That would be too late. So I think society, with the help of the government or the state, need to intervene at some point.

443
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,360
But that doesn't necessarily require a huge bureaucratic and authoritarian leader and system.

444
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,240
And we will have more of this kind of planning everywhere.

445
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:19,880
And we still haven't have a very good detailed theory with democratic planning yet because planning has been something very external to the logic of capitalism,

446
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:26,760
especially neoliberalism is about market competition and price and, you know, profit and so on.

447
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:44,040
But this system of profit making is turning out quite inefficient because capitalism invests in what is profitable, not necessarily what is important and what is sustainable and so on.

448
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:53,480
So I think we really have to restructure the entire process of decision making because it is not just simply about profit making.

449
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:00,760
It needs to be about necessity, provisioning and equity and so on.

450
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,200
But these are the things that, as I said in the beginning, the gross people do not necessarily want to talk about.

451
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:14,600
They often tend to talk about reduction of working hours, basic income, a little bit of carbon taxes and so on.

452
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:23,560
These are obviously important, but at the same time, I think this new idea of socialist democratic planning will be added on the list.

453
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:33,560
And I think here the socialist tradition can actually contribute a lot because we have a debate in the 20s, for example, initiated by Otto Neulert.

454
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:43,040
These are the kind of things that we can actually maybe, you know, explore again in order to imagine a future society.

455
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:56,880
You state that envisioning another clear, bright future from a Marxian perspective without falling into pessimism and apocalypticism in the face of global ecological crisis is a really important part of your project.

456
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,680
So you now just stated some elements of it when it comes to democratic planning.

457
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,240
Are there other aspects of this political imaginary that you would like to sketch for us?

458
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,040
I think, I mean, I'm not a policymaker.

459
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,240
So, I mean, people can actually add whatever they like on this list of demand.

460
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:28,400
But what I wanted to do as a philosopher is basically this reworking of our narrow horizon of ideas.

461
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:46,720
Because even especially like countries like Japan, where the society is very conservative, but also in European and American societies, people do not talk about socialism or communism anymore after the collapse of Soviet Union.

462
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,320
People sort of give up achieving something beyond capitalism.

463
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,480
They only talk about green capitalism or stakeholder capitalism.

464
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,680
And it's like everything about capitalism, but with some better objective.

465
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,680
But I do not think this is really compatible because capitalism is about greed.

466
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,400
Capitalism is about monopoly. Capitalism is about destroying the planet.

467
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,960
So I think the green capitalism or these kind of things are not really possible.

468
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,840
And in a sense, these are very ideological because they hide the truth that the capitalism is not sustainable.

469
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:34,040
But we will often stick to that kind of ideas because we believe that capitalism is something inevitable and we can never overcome anymore and so on.

470
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:43,000
But I think I was also inspired by left acceleration, accelerationist in the sense they also demanded some kind of the utopian ideas.

471
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,560
And I think this tradition of the left needs to come back, especially because capitalism is now failing in many aspects.

472
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,480
So I think one of my projects, Degros Communism, is OK.

473
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:03,280
It's totally fine to talk about socialism or communism again, or it isn't even necessary.

474
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:15,000
Otherwise, our political solution, our social movement and our other concrete measures like policies will be confined always within capitalism.

475
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,960
And I'm not saying that the communism or socialism will be very easy achieved.

476
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,760
We have to start with something that we could do.

477
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:29,280
I mean, even abandoning or banning private jet is really hard if you think about this power relations today.

478
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,960
But even after that successful banning of private jet, it's capitalism.

479
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,760
The society will be totally capitalist.

480
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:42,760
But with some very different ideas of what's the final goal of being rich.

481
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,600
Today, it's having private jets, but they have to rethink because it's banned already.

482
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:55,200
So our conception of wealth and our conception of economic activity or the goal of economic activity will gradually change.

483
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:02,520
And this will create some rooms for more radical anti-capitalist activities.

484
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:10,040
And so this is, in a sense, as Joachim Hirsch once said, radical reformism, radical reformism.

485
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,920
And so this is reformism.

486
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:20,160
We gradually, you know, tax bad things and stop bad production and, you know, ban certain things.

487
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,280
It's gradual process within capitalism.

488
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,120
So it's reformist. But at the same time, it will have a very radical conquest after certain points.

489
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,040
So this is something that we should do.

490
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,920
We cannot aim after the kind of the Soviet revolution today anymore.

491
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,320
It will not be successful. It will not automatically change this entire system so easily.

492
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,920
So we should have this kind of the radical reformist politics.

493
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:57,000
And since you obviously ditched this idea that there is some deterministic historical materialism in which there will be necessarily some form of conflict,

494
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,000
which will escalate and then lead to communism, the question remains whether or not there will have to be a moment of revolution.

495
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,880
Because right now you kind of sketched ideas around this idea of revolutionary politics.

496
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:25,760
But do you think there will have to be some form of moment or moment of rupture in which some kind of revolutionary moment breaks through?

497
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,400
And if yes, how what could what could this look like?

498
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,360
Oh, yes, yes. I mean, there will be those moments.

499
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,800
Because this current status quo will not be continued.

500
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:42,240
We have this kind of political crisis of ecology, capitalism, democracy and so on.

501
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:51,680
So, I mean, so many things will be going down and then there will be more and more conflict and expression, dissatisfaction everywhere.

502
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,960
And this will accelerate in the coming year.

503
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:05,680
So in a sense that there will be a moment of uprisings, hopefully, and there will be more radical imaginaries coming out of those movements.

504
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,560
These are recent events about, you know, Extinction Rebellion, Black Lives Matter.

505
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:19,440
And I already I always endorse those kind of attempts and I highly respect those people who are actually acting and fighting against injustice and so on.

506
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:26,280
But this is something I think, you know, it's something not what we can already predict.

507
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:32,600
And it will be I will be inspired and I will learn from these new revolutionary moments.

508
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:39,800
But rather what I'm trying to do in my book is what we can do even without those kind of uprising.

509
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,640
Maybe we will have to we cannot wait until these events come.

510
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:53,360
So we have to first implement some of the measures that we can actually start now without those ruptures.

511
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,200
But I also understand your point.

512
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,760
I mean, even banning, as I said, the private jet is one of the easiest example.

513
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:09,600
But even that will probably require some kind of the disruption and uprising that could be regarded as something revolutionary.

514
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,160
So let's see how it will happen.

515
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:26,240
But I think the first point about my book is basically we will have to set a kind of a new vision, a new idea, which should be today termed as degrossed communism.

516
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,280
There's a last question I ask all of my guests.

517
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,320
And it is if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

518
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:39,080
Well, I'm not that optimistic about the current situation.

519
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:49,640
So in these kind of gloomy times, I often I sometimes think we are all kind of doomed.

520
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:58,880
But at the same time, we especially as a philosopher, I think we need to have a kind of the optimism of the will.

521
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,160
We will still have some chance to create a better future.

522
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:10,160
And then there are people who have been fighting for various justice in the past.

523
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:20,200
And that's why we especially at least in the countries like Japan and Austria, people enjoy basic human rights and democracy and a good environment and so on.

524
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,600
These are the results of a constant fighting.

525
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,520
And we also owe to the people in the past.

526
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:42,120
And I think one of the ways that we try to continue and we will we are we are witnessing the emergence of even younger generations acting in a very radical way is on the past generations.

527
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:53,920
So I'm very optimistic. In a sense, I'm very optimistic when I see these new movements coming out and I can also learn from them and fight with them and create maybe a better future.

528
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,240
Wonderful. Koi, thank you so much for being part of your gestures.

529
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,640
Thank you.
