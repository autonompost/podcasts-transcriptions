0	8000	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome Thomas Swann in today's episode.
8000	14000	He's the author of Anarchist Cybernetics, Control and Communication in Radical Politics,
14000	25000	a book I enjoyed reading immensely since it merges two fields of interest that are frequently featured in this podcast, anarchism and cybernetics.
25000	36000	And a quick shout out, since they have an episode talking about the book Anarchist Cybernetics and since I enjoy their podcast in general quite a lot,
36000	43000	I wanted to point you all towards the Cybernetic Marxist Podcast General Intellect Unit.
43000	51000	You'll find the link in the show notes together with a bunch of other interesting material about and around Thomas' work.
51000	57000	And now please enjoy today's episode with Thomas Swann on Anarchist Cybernetics.
63000	64000	Welcome, Thomas.
64000	66000	Thanks very much Jan, thanks for having me.
66000	71000	I'm really, really glad you enjoyed the book and really looking forward to talking about it.
71000	72000	Thank you.
72000	75000	Great. I'm very much looking forward to it as well.
75000	82000	Even though, as I said, both anarchism and cybernetics have been featured in future histories and other episodes already,
82000	87000	I think it would be still good to start with a kind of overview.
87000	93000	Could you give us a brief idea of your understanding of cybernetics as well as anarchism?
93000	94000	Yeah, of course. Yeah.
94000	101000	And so I'm going to start with anarchism because I think that's that was sort of my starting point going into cybernetics.
101000	109000	And so I think there's sort of two elements of anarchism which are which are important to highlight.
109000	117000	And the first of these is what we can kind of consider the critique that anarchism gives us.
117000	127000	So anarchism gives us a certain set of tools for helping us understand why society looks the way it does,
127000	135000	why politics operates the way it does, why the economy functions in the ways that it does.
135000	144000	So right from the very early days of anarchism, so back to the sort of middle of the 19th century with people like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon,
144000	147000	we really see this critique coming through really strong.
147000	154000	So it really is a way of looking at how capitalism was developing, how colonialism was developing,
154000	160000	and being able to provide tools to say, OK, we can understand what's happening here.
160000	165000	We can understand why hierarchies emerge in societies.
165000	173000	We can understand the links between the kind of hierarchical domination that we see in the state,
173000	182000	where we have a sort of centralized top-down government that dictates laws and controls the police, has a monopoly on violence.
182000	195000	How that is very, very closely connected and perhaps even inseparable from how economic exploitation operates through capitalism.
195000	202000	So how the means of production are owned by wealthy capitalists.
202000	209000	And that means that everyone else, the working class, are selling labor and are exploited in that.
210000	217000	So that capitalists can make profit off of the labor that other people are doing.
217000	226000	So anarchism gives us a way of linking those and seeing that the emergence of capitalism and the emergence of the state,
226000	231000	of the modern state, were very much the same process.
231000	236000	And they're different things with different operating logics,
236000	246000	but they reinforce one another and they've emerged historically together because they are mutually beneficial and reinforce one another.
246000	255000	And I think recently we've seen that sort of critique element of anarchism expanded by thinking in much more detail
255000	263000	about how things like patriarchy and white supremacy and colonialism are also tied up in this picture.
263000	270000	So you have that in the sort of history of anarchism with people like Lucy Parsons and Emma Goldman bringing a kind of feminist
270000	276000	and sometimes anti-racist critique into that sort of critical element of anarchism.
276000	281000	But over the last couple of decades, probably we've seen that come through much, much stronger,
281000	289000	particularly as anarchism has started to draw on sort of black radical politics, black feminism, intersectionality.
289000	298000	So we've seen a lot of that sort of critique coming through of how anarchism can help us explain why the world looks the way it does.
298000	304000	But the second element of anarchism, which I think is really important as well, and perhaps even more important,
304000	311000	is finding ways to dismantle or destroy those particular systems.
311000	317000	So the state, capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, anarchism also gives us tools to understand them,
317000	323000	but also to how can we dismantle or destroy them and create alternatives.
323000	330000	So how can we think about how we govern our communities, how we create agreements between each other,
330000	338000	how we guarantee security, guarantee safety, security in terms of physical safety,
338000	343000	but also food security, material security, things like that.
343000	352000	So anarchism gives us the tools to also build something different, build a kind of alternative to the systems that we currently face
352000	360000	and importantly build alternatives that don't have domination, don't have hierarchical control,
360000	367000	don't have economic exploitation, don't have racist or patriarchal domination built into them.
367000	374000	So how can we create alternative systems? And there's a very close link between the critique and those alternatives,
374000	382000	because what anarchists were doing from the very early days, one of the things that distinguishes anarchism
382000	391000	is the kind of utopian elements of imagining what kind of future society can we create.
391000	398000	That wasn't something that the anarchists were just sitting around and trying to think up,
398000	401000	hey, what would the best society look like?
401000	407000	They were actually taking inspiration from how indigenous societies were organized,
407000	411000	how peasant communities were organized before capitalism.
411000	419000	So they were really saying, okay, there are these seeds for how society can be organized in more democratic,
419000	424000	more horizontal ways. We're not inventing this new.
424000	431000	This is something that exists in the past and exists still in everyday life in a lot of ways.
431000	441000	So it's really how we can sort of expand that so that that is the main logic of how we organize ourselves.
441000	446000	So that kind of covers anarchism, I think, and there's probably a lot more to say about it,
446000	449000	but that's, I think, the sort of bedrock of it.
449000	456000	So it is a philosophy aimed at how can we critique things like domination and exploitation,
456000	459000	but also how can we create alternatives?
459000	462000	How can we create non-dominating ways of living together?
462000	468000	How can we create non-exploitative ways of living together?
468000	472000	And I think so for me, there's a close link between that and cybernetics,
472000	480000	because at least the way I understand cybernetics and the way I discovered it was through a focus on self-organization.
480000	491000	So cybernetics emerged kind of in the post-World War II technological and scientific milieu,
491000	499000	particularly looking at electronic systems and very early computer systems and mechanical systems
499000	509000	for how those systems can be autonomous and self-organized and don't require constant human control.
509000	515000	But it quite quickly sort of developed into thinking about, well, can we apply some of that to social systems?
515000	520000	So can we think about how social systems can be self-organized?
520000	527000	And I think the way cybernetics, well, what's really useful about cybernetics and thinking this through
527000	534000	is that what it tries to do is identify the functions for effective self-organization.
534000	544000	So what are the different kind of functions that any system, electronic, social, mechanical, biological as well,
544000	554000	what are the sort of functions that any of these systems need to have in order to be able to organize themselves without external control?
554000	559000	And that's the really important thing for me with cybernetics.
559000	565000	The way cyberneticians have sort of gone into this and expanded on this,
565000	572000	there's a lot more detail there around the role of feedback, the role of information flows and communication.
572000	583000	But I think at its foundations, it really is a way of saying we can pick out the different essential functions of a self-organizing system.
583000	591000	And then with social systems, that's in a question of, OK, how do we, if those functions don't exist already, how do we create them?
591000	599000	If they already exist, how do we strengthen them? How do we make social systems better at self-organizing?
599000	608000	Hearing these definitions of anarchism and cybernetics already gives us an idea of this, but maybe you could elaborate a bit further.
608000	614000	What potential did you see in bringing those two together, anarchism and cybernetics?
614000	622000	What made you work towards anarchist cybernetics, actually? And maybe what was the problem you wanted to see addressed?
623000	633000	Yes, so I think what got me interested in cybernetics, and I think that, well, yeah, I think starting from here might help answer that question.
633000	645000	So what got me interested was, more than a decade ago now, when there was the 2011 uprisings,
645000	652000	we had the Arab Spring and the Indignados in Spain and then the Occupy movement.
652000	663000	But there was also the riots in London in that year as well, which aren't often brought into this picture of the 2011 uprisings,
663000	668000	because a lot of people look at them and say, well, they weren't explicitly political, they didn't make demands.
668000	674000	It was more this kind of eruption of chaos.
674000	686000	But I think that sort of doesn't really do service to how that kind of riot is very political, how it's born of a particular political situation.
686000	693000	And it is a reaction to the kind of political forces that people are experiencing in their lives.
693000	706000	But what really interested me about the London riots was, you had this experience over three or four days when essentially lots of groups of teenagers
706000	720000	were able to sort of outperform or outorganize one of the most well-resourced, well-adapted, largest police forces in the world.
720000	731000	And the way they did that, which drew my attention, was because of the confluence of a certain number of factors.
731000	740000	By accident, they actually had in their hands these incredibly powerful communication tools.
740000	744000	So BlackBerry phones at the time were very, very cheap.
744000	749000	They were trying to sort of, this is when BlackBerry was first trying to expand the use of smartphones.
749000	752000	So they made these phones incredibly cheap.
752000	766000	So loads of these teenagers had BlackBerry smartphones and BlackBerry had its own messaging system, which was incredibly strong encryption.
766000	770000	So people could send messages. There was no way for the police to see those messages.
770000	777000	There was no way for BlackBerry to actually get into that system and see those messages because it was a system that BlackBerry was trying to develop
777000	782000	and market at big corporations and governments and things like that.
782000	785000	So they wanted it to be incredibly secure.
785000	797000	But what that meant was that you had these young people in London and other parts of the UK as well were able to network in real time incredibly effectively.
797000	803000	So they were able to share information. They were able to communicate safe routes through the city.
803000	807000	They were able to communicate the position of police around the city.
807000	813000	And that allowed them to evade the police and escape arrest for quite some days.
813000	820000	It didn't last that long, but it was still quite incredible that it managed for as long as it did.
821000	830000	And that kind of tied in with a lot of sort of narratives around the time around network politics and how these new technologies,
830000	840000	there was a sort of second wave of internet technologies which were becoming much more common and more accessible, but also much more mobile.
840000	847000	So people had internet technologies in their pockets suddenly for the first time.
847000	855000	And so there was a lot of talk around 2011 and the years around that about this new kind of networked form of politics.
855000	865000	And yes, it was more information was shared very fast and allowed people to respond and adapt to situations very, very quickly
865000	873000	without needing to have a centralized control structure that was taking information in and then giving orders out.
873000	881000	But then also we saw with things like Occupy and the Arab Spring and Dignados, that also brought a democratic element in because
881000	889000	partly because of these technologies, but also just because of the kind of politics that people were working with at the time.
889000	897000	These movements were much more radically democratic than a lot of uprisings and revolutions that we've seen in the past.
898000	906000	That period is typically referred to as the movement of the squares because one of the things that was typified by was people occupying
906000	916000	public squares in different parts of big cities and typically across the world, people were holding assemblies.
916000	919000	They were making decisions democratically.
919000	923000	There weren't really leaders in a traditional sense.
923000	931000	And people, everyone, at least in theory, everyone could participate in how these social movements were governed.
931000	944000	So they were very self-organized in a very anarchistic sense, even if they weren't all explicitly anarchist or drawing on anarchist politics.
944000	950000	But I think that sort of, for me, sort of drew me into cybernetics.
950000	962000	And it was through reading the work of Colin Ward, a very, very influential British anarchist in the post-war years, 60s through to the 80s or 90s.
962000	969000	Colin Ward is one of the most influential figures in British anarchism in this period.
969000	978000	And he writes a lot about self-organization and he sort of drops the word cybernetics a couple of times and things that he wrote, but doesn't really expand on it in much detail.
978000	983000	But I think just reading that and the word cybernetics, I was like, oh, that sounds interesting.
983000	988000	That's quite a sexy term that I've not heard mentioned before.
988000	1004000	And that sort of drew me in and realized, well, there were a handful of engagements with cybernetics by anarchists kind of from the very early 1960s onwards, probably through the 1980s.
1004000	1010000	And it was around linking how cybernetics sees self-organization.
1010000	1028000	So as I mentioned in this sort of way of identifying what are the sort of functions for effective self-organization, but also just that very basic point about systems are at their most effective in dealing with change, dealing with complex environments.
1028000	1042000	When they have a high level of flexibility and a high level of autonomy built into the systems and self-organization allows for that because you don't need to have a central sort of organizing core in a system.
1042000	1062000	Because if you're dealing in a complex environment, the sort of information flow into that central organizing core and then the decision making and the orders that then come out of it, that's a very slow process or it can be a very slow process.
1062000	1070000	And a lot of the work of some of the cyberneticians that I've sort of focused on, we can talk more about them in detail if you'd like.
1070000	1085000	But they kind of identify, well, if a system is in a complex environment that's changing very fast and it's trying to filter information through some central control hub,
1085000	1093000	you know, by the time that information is taken in, processed and orders are fed back out, the situation will have changed again.
1093000	1096000	And so those orders won't be actually relevant.
1096000	1109000	So the way systems cope with that is by being self-organized so that the different parts have a high level of autonomy to actually respond to change as they see fit.
1109000	1114000	So they have some level of autonomy whereby they can say, okay, it's a complex environment.
1114000	1117000	It's suddenly changing and we don't have to wait for orders.
1117000	1123000	We don't have to send information up the chain and wait for a decision to be made and come back down to us.
1123000	1129000	We can just make a decision and operate in this complex environment ourselves.
1129000	1135000	And I think that kind of autonomy is also one of the strong links with anarchism.
1135000	1144000	And it's something we saw in the, you know, these 2011 movements, you know, the London riots, these different groups of teenagers, which were running around, were autonomous.
1144000	1146000	There wasn't a central control structure.
1146000	1158000	They were autonomously, because of the information that was being shared in these communication networks, they were able to move around the city autonomously, avoid the police, you know, get to safe places, have escape routes.
1158000	1166000	So they were able to coordinate themselves in a very decentralized and autonomous way.
1166000	1175000	So I think that's exploring that in more detail as a sort of potential for anarchist engagement with cybernetics.
1175000	1182000	Very interesting, because I thought that your first interest, but this was just me reading your book.
1182000	1192000	I thought your first interest or the gateway through which you came to cybernetics would have been exactly what you talked about in the last sentences.
1192000	1204000	Because, I mean, one of the more popular readings of these movement of the squares is that while these were experiences that are super important,
1204000	1213000	still, they argued to have been very ineffective and that they kind of failed in some way.
1213000	1223000	And that was me thinking when reading your book that your engagement with cybernetics was also you thinking that cybernetics would be of help.
1223000	1236000	Exactly on this question, on this problem of how to effectively organize these approaches that you're actually in favor of through applying a cybernetic lens, so to speak.
1236000	1243000	I would guess this was somewhat one of the things that drove you to cybernetics as well.
1243000	1252000	Yeah, it was. Yeah. So I think that question of how successful these movements were is really, really important.
1252000	1255000	I think we can look at it in a number of ways.
1255000	1268000	And I think one of them is to think how effective or how successful were they at bringing about some kind of large scale political or economic change.
1268000	1274000	And we can look across the world and see, well, yeah, there's sort of very, very mixed results there.
1275000	1284000	So obviously, in the very immediate term, some of the movements in North Africa and the Middle East were able to overthrow governments.
1284000	1293000	Whether the situations they've got now are in line with the aspirations of those movements, that's obviously incredibly debatable.
1293000	1308000	And we also see, obviously, some of these in places like Libya and Syria, the outcomes has been civil war and huge amount of violence and destruction and people having to flee their homes in massive numbers.
1308000	1321000	So it's obviously like, yeah, whether there was a sort of immediate political change that was in line with the demands or the desires of those movements, that's incredibly debatable.
1321000	1334000	I think if we look at somewhere like, well, in the UK or the United States as well, we can see, well, part of a sort of outcome of these movements was a kind of delayed response in a sense.
1334000	1352000	But then, from 2015 up until 2020, we had this sort of new left-wing populist surge in the UK around Jeremy Corbyn and in the US around Bernie Sanders and some other similar politicians.
1352000	1372000	So we can see that's kind of, I mean, and there is stuff in those sort of populist surges around more direct democracy, more decentralized democratic systems, certainly economic systems that are much, much fatter and involve more opportunity for participation.
1372000	1381000	But yeah, definitely these movements didn't achieve what they set out to achieve in very concrete terms.
1381000	1398000	But one of the other things that they were trying to do, which I think they did succeed in, was trying to imagine an experiment with new ways of organizing societies.
1398000	1408000	So Occupy is the example that I've looked into the most, but we see similar things in the different movements of the squares around the world.
1408000	1418000	Occupy was able to create a kind of microcosm of radically democratic, radically participatory society.
1418000	1432000	And it was something important. This is, again, where I think this sort of anarchist politics isn't coming from the position of saying, we've come up with this perfect utopian blueprint.
1432000	1439000	Now let's put it into practice. It was very much an experiment. It was very much saying, well, let's try these different ways of doing democracy.
1439000	1444000	Let's try them out and let's adapt them as we go on.
1444000	1459000	So something we see with Occupy is, you know, it started with the General Assembly, which, you know, was, you know, these were, you know, large meetings run for the most part by consensus decision-making.
1460000	1473000	Everyone had to be in agreement for a certain proposal to actually be passed. And these were meetings involving, in the case of Occupy Wall Street, thousands of people were taking part in these meetings, sometimes multiple times a day.
1473000	1482000	And these were incredibly effective, you know, incredibly complex and detailed decisions were being made in these assemblies.
1483000	1492000	People were dealing with complex legal things, complex financial matters, and they were able to do this fairly effectively.
1492000	1514000	But as time went on with Occupy Wall Street in particular, they started to see, well, this large General Assembly perhaps isn't the most effective way of doing a lot of the day-to-day coordination and administration of, you know, a large encampment of people.
1514000	1526000	So they created, you know, sort of a smaller spokes council where it would be, you know, delegates from different working groups and different parts of the camp would be involved in making these more kind of strategic decisions.
1526000	1533000	The General Assembly still happened, but they were more for, you know, more sort of broader political discussions and decisions.
1533000	1541000	Then the spokes council was a way of making the strategic decision-making much more effective and much more coordinated.
1541000	1559000	So I think it's important to see these movements, part of the success of them is that they were trying and testing and adapting and experimenting with, you know, really, really radical ways of thinking about how we can organize society in very democratic, very participatory ways.
1559000	1572000	And I think that's part of the legacy we have to sort of hold on to and see, okay, how is that sort of legacy of rather than just talking about maybe these, you know, new forms of democracy would work?
1572000	1584000	Well, you know, people have tried them in large, large groups under very, very difficult circumstances, have tried them and adapted them and come out with, you know, sort of solutions to a lot of the problems that emerged.
1584000	1594000	I think another thing about the sort of failure of these movements, the kind of odds they were up against were massive, right?
1594000	1609000	I mean, when Occupy Walls, when the Occupy movement in the U.S. was finally put down, you know, that was a huge coordinated police action, you know, across the whole of the U.S.
1609000	1624000	At exactly the same time, police forces, you know, highly militarized police forces with, you know, very, very advanced sort of capabilities in terms of, you know, crowd control and dealing with large groups of people.
1624000	1629000	You know, they moved in and dismantled and destroyed these camps all at the same time.
1629000	1645000	And I think to try and imagine how the Occupy movement could have withstood that and could have survived in some kind of real form beyond that is that's very difficult to imagine what that could have looked like.
1645000	1650000	I mean, the way it did survive was into something like Occupy Sandy.
1650000	1673000	So when Hurricane Sandy hit New York, the mutual aid network that emerged, which was, you know, for several days was the main sort of coordination of, you know, aid and support and shelter and resources for people who were affected by this hurricane.
1673000	1678000	That was organized by people who had been part of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
1678000	1687000	And they were applying a lot of this stuff around, you know, decentralized organization, you know, autonomous network coordination.
1687000	1689000	They were applying that to that mutual aid effort.
1689000	1697000	So that's something, one of the really important things that did emerge out of Occupy in the U.S. at least.
1697000	1706000	Yeah, and I think it's super important that we look at the actual experiences and not just ditch them as if everything failed.
1706000	1724000	And it's super important to kind of learn out of these experiences since we actually do want to build structures that do live on and survive, that do not kind of end when one coordinated effort through the state destroys the actual camps.
1724000	1731000	In this case, we do need and do want structures that survive beyond such a blow.
1731000	1747000	And for this, we need to enrich the analytic aspect of looking at the movement of the squares and enrich the tactics, the strategies and in your language, the grand strategies that we apply in order to achieve these goals.
1747000	1752000	So let's dive a little deeper into the components of anarchist cybernetics.
1752000	1759000	I mean, cybernetics is kind of by definition a very broad field when it comes to anarchist cybernetics.
1759000	1765000	You are specifically interested in a subfield, a subfield called organizational cybernetics.
1765000	1772000	And within this subfield, you focus on the work of Stafford Beer and his viable system model.
1772000	1781000	So could you give us an overview of the VSM, the viable system model and how it informs anarchist cybernetics?
1781000	1786000	Yeah, so the viable system model, I think, is really, really interesting.
1786000	1799000	So what it does as a kind of model of how any kind of system can be organized is it tries to sort of separate out the different functions within a system.
1799000	1810000	And very broadly it does. So there's two very broad parts of this kind of model, of this picture of an effective self-organizing system.
1810000	1817000	So one is the kind of operational part. So you have, you know, the actual day to day operations of any system.
1817000	1825000	So if we're thinking about, you know, something like, I mean, yeah, we could look at something that occupied Wall Street,
1825000	1831000	but I think something I'm really interested in at the moment is thinking about how this applies to worker cooperatives.
1831000	1834000	So I'll kind of take that example a bit.
1834000	1841000	So if we imagine a kind of cafe that's run in a kind of, you know, collective cooperative way.
1841000	1852000	So the day to day operations would be, you know, obviously, you know, you know, producing food, you know, making drinks, serving customers, you know, opening and closing, cleaning, things like this.
1852000	1857000	So you have these sort of day to day activities.
1857000	1861000	And then you also have how these are sort of coordinated in a very immediate way, right?
1861000	1873000	So you have to make sure, for example, if a customer puts in an order for, you know, a meal and some drinks, that, you know, okay, who's making the drinks and who's making the food?
1873000	1884000	There has to be some coordination there so that, you know, they kind of arrive at the right time and the person's not, I don't know, sitting with their food for an hour before the drink comes or the other way around.
1884000	1889000	So there has to be some sort of basic coordination between these different functions.
1889000	1897000	But then what the VSM does, which I think is really interesting, is it says, okay, so this is the operational part, these basic functions and how they coordinate.
1897000	1911000	But we also have a kind of meta systemic part, which is the kind of broader or more strategic coordination of sort of system or organization as a whole.
1911000	1926000	So if we take this example of the kind of, you know, cooperative cafe, this would be thinking about questions of how does the sort of business strategy develop within this collective?
1926000	1939000	So it might be that they have weekly meetings where they, you know, reflect on what's happened during the week, you know, do things like, you know, monitor how much stock is left, how much has been sold,
1939000	1946000	whether some things are more popular than others and whether there's any sort of conflicts between different parts of the operation.
1946000	1957000	And it allows them to sort of reflect on that outside of the day to day context and sort of step out of that and say, OK, well, now we're going to look at this as a kind of system as a whole.
1957000	1967000	And we're going to have this systemic overview of everything that's happening rather than just the day to day immediate coordination.
1967000	1974000	And I think that sort of meta system is what is really important with the viable systems model.
1974000	1986000	So I think it's the kind of thing that is often there's often not that separation between the day to day operations and the sort of meta systemic strategy or coordination or monitoring.
1986000	1996000	Often when a lot of in a lot of ways, things like cooperatives or anarchist collectives are described in terms of organization.
1996000	2004000	There's a kind of mixing of these and they're kind of bound up together and they're not really not really distinguished at all.
2004000	2017000	And I think when that happens, often what it means is that some of the key functions that, as I said, cybernetics identifies don't happen or don't happen well enough or happen at the wrong time.
2017000	2030000	So I think separating these things out allows us to sort of say, OK, we can identify what the key functions of this meta systemic strategy are and we can make sure that they happen in the right ways.
2030000	2044000	And importantly, from an anarchist perspective or from the perspective of a worker owned cooperative, how can we make sure these functions are organized in a democratic and participatory way?
2044000	2053000	So rather than just saying the typical business, well, there's the day to day activities and then there's the management activities.
2054000	2059000	And that's sort of management decisions and management strategy.
2059000	2069000	There's a select group of people who are a kind of elite within the organization who have the decision making power over what happens there.
2069000	2076000	From an anarchist perspective, separating these things out allows us to say, well, we can have these functions.
2077000	2097000	We can be doing things like developing a long term strategy, monitoring performance in different ways, making decisions about how we can coordinate things better, how we can move resources around in better ways, how we can communicate in better ways.
2097000	2103000	But we can do all these things in democratic and participatory ways.
2103000	2117000	So it doesn't mean that we have the operational parts of the organization, which is the workers and then the meta systemic strategy parts, which is the managers.
2117000	2132000	Essentially, we have the same people doing both, not at the same time, because that's when it becomes too complicated and too difficult to manage, but at a certain point stepping out of the operational roles and into the strategy roles.
2132000	2139000	So as I said, this could be weekly meetings, monthly meetings, maybe once a year there would be a kind of larger strategy discussion.
2139000	2147000	But you have these sort of moments when people can step out of their operational roles into the more strategic roles.
2147000	2154000	And that allows for that kind of coordination to happen in democratic ways.
2155000	2166000	You mentioned at some point within your answer that sometimes these things get mixed up and then some of the functions actually do not really happen and are not being addressed.
2166000	2177000	And I would add that sometimes, depending on the context, you even have the situation that people are opposed to actually applying some of these functions.
2177000	2190000	I mean, in the example of the cafe, it's a bit more relaxed, I would say, because people might intuitively grasp that there is a need for some kind of higher level coordination as well.
2190000	2203000	But if you take the example of a society as a whole and try to apply this lens, then you will come to questions of hierarchy versus autonomy and stuff like that.
2203000	2222000	And then specifically within anarchist communities, you might have some strong reaction actually against having this higher level, so to speak, coordination function being applied because it is perceived as a form of unwanted hierarchy.
2222000	2225000	So I think it would be fruitful.
2225000	2230000	And this is something you do within the book in a very good way, I would say.
2230000	2247000	I think it would be fruitful to use the VSM as a diagnostic tool in order to look at some of the key principles that are relevant for anarchist organization from a different perspective, from the perspective of anarchist cybernetics in this case.
2247000	2256000	Because I think you can, by doing that, address some of the more fundamental open questions within anarchist organization.
2256000	2259000	So maybe you could elaborate a bit.
2259000	2265000	What does it look like to apply the viable system model to anarchist self-organization?
2265000	2270000	Maybe you could give us an overview of an anarchist viable system model.
2270000	2289000	Yeah, so the way that I've done it in the book, and that's just a product of the fact that it's a written document like a book, is very much me on the outside looking at something like the Occupy movement or like I've just done for this cooperative cafe.
2289000	2296000	You're looking at it from the outside and seeing how does this work in terms of a viable, effective system.
2296000	2304000	But the way that it really ought to be applied is in a much more participatory and involved way.
2304000	2316000	So rather than someone like myself standing on the outside and analyzing the organization, it's something that the people in the organization should be doing collectively.
2316000	2322000	So part of their discussions might be, okay, how can we start to understand the different functions?
2322000	2334000	And one of the incredibly useful tools in doing this is work that was developed by John Walker.
2334000	2344000	So John Walker was somebody who was working in a number of cooperatives in the north of England in the 1980s, 1990s,
2344000	2353000	and got in contact with Stafford Beer because he started to learn about cybernetics and thinking that maybe this could work for cooperatives.
2353000	2361000	And what John Walker's done is he's written a sort of handbook on the viable systems model for cooperatives.
2361000	2369000	And it's not explicitly anarchist, but I think it does chime incredibly well with anarchist politics.
2369000	2379000	And so what John sort of suggests is he does an incredible amount of detail because he's tried this with different cooperatives time and again.
2379000	2384000	So he's worked out in terms of this is the process that actually works.
2384000	2389000	But he basically just goes through a number of steps that you would do with a group.
2389000	2398000	So if you're in a cooperative, you can look at John's viable systems model guide and go through different steps, answer different questions.
2398000	2408000	And what that means essentially is doing things like trying to identify the environment that you're operating in as an organization.
2408000	2411000	What are the different factors involved in that environment?
2411000	2417000	How does the environment change? And then also positioning yourself as an organization within that.
2417000	2422000	So what are the sort of interactions you have with the environment?
2422000	2430000	At what point of the organization are you engaging with different situations that are maybe changing in different ways?
2430000	2441000	So to take the example of the cafe, for example, they might say, well, part of our environment is the customers that are coming in to the business.
2441000	2445000	And we have people who are engaging with them.
2445000	2450000	We have cooks who are making food for them, people making drinks, people taking orders from them.
2450000	2456000	You have these different ways of interacting with that environment.
2456000	2464000	And that's the kind of starting point, I think, for thinking about how this viable systems model process can work within an organization.
2464000	2472000	Because once people start to do that and John's viable systems model guide goes through a lot of steps and a lot more detail.
2472000	2476000	But you start to sort of actually identify the different functions.
2476000	2484000	So you start to say, OK, what are our different operational parts of our organization?
2484000	2490000	As I said, it might be people serving customers, people making the food, people making the drinks, people doing the cleaning.
2490000	2497000	So you can start to sort of map out the different operational parts of the organization.
2497000	2504000	And the way John talks about this is you actually have massive sheets of paper and you write all this down.
2504000	2509000	You start to start to actually map out what the organization does day to day.
2509000	2512000	And then you can start to think, well, how do these interact?
2512000	2516000	So what are the points where these different functions interact with each other?
2516000	2522000	So when do the different operational parts come into contact?
2522000	2525000	And that just starts allowing you to see, OK, is there any other clashes?
2525000	2527000	Is there any sort of conflict here?
2527000	2532000	Are there any areas where actually the way they come into contact isn't the most effective?
2532000	2534000	It creates more problems than it solves.
2534000	2540000	So you can start to sort of help with some of the coordination that way just by mapping out those interactions.
2540000	2552000	But then you can also go to the next kind of meta-systemic level and start to say, OK, within the organization, where is it we are doing strategy, for example?
2552000	2556000	Where is it we are thinking about long term planning?
2556000	2559000	Is this something we are doing?
2560000	2563000	And again, you can sort of map this out in the big piece of paper.
2563000	2568000	Well, OK, we have this monthly meeting where we do this.
2568000	2571000	Or maybe we don't. Maybe we need to start doing it.
2571000	2580000	Maybe we need to have a monthly meeting where we talk about strategy, where we look at what's happening outside the business and the environment, but also what's happening within it.
2580000	2582000	So what kind of changes are happening?
2582000	2587000	Is there any conflicts? Are there any difficulties? Are there any issues that are developing?
2587000	2590000	You can have that internal and external view.
2590000	2595000	And also you can start saying, how are we actually monitoring what's happening?
2595000	2603000	Do we have any functions within our organization for actually keeping a track of what's happening day to day?
2603000	2607000	So that we can then say, well, this works really well.
2607000	2610000	This doesn't work really well. This could be better this way.
2610000	2613000	This could be more effective if it was done like this.
2613000	2625000	If you start mapping out these functions of how are we monitoring things, how are we developing a long term strategy, it allows you to see, OK, maybe we could be doing these better.
2625000	2628000	Or maybe if we're not doing them, we can start doing them.
2628000	2632000	Maybe we can learn from what other cooperatives are doing around us.
2632000	2642000	And I think these are these are the steps that something like an anarchist collective or cooperative, even just a community of people living together, could be going through.
2642000	2649000	So it's taking that time to actually sit down and have discussions about what is it we're doing day to day?
2649000	2651000	How is that coordinated?
2651000	2657000	Could that coordination be made more effective now that we've started to map it out and actually look at it?
2657000	2662000	And in this kind of, you know, have this sort of overview.
2662000	2665000	But then also, how are we actually monitoring things?
2665000	2668000	How are we checking that things are working OK?
2668000	2670000	That could be monitoring performance.
2670000	2673000	Also, just checking, is everyone happy in the organization?
2673000	2676000	Does everyone still feel fulfilled?
2676000	2678000	Does everyone still feel at home in this community?
2678000	2684000	You can start checking for these things in more conscious ways, I think.
2684000	2688000	And then building a strategy that takes all of this into account.
2688000	2690000	Well, you were answering.
2690000	2700000	I'm thinking like, all right, this very much sounds like something that already happens within our societies today in the form of business consulting, so to speak.
2700000	2706000	And this is, of course, not a coincidence, because there would be was a business consultant as well.
2706000	2722000	So I think it would be important to kind of tie this back to why this kind of thinking is actually also fruitful for trying to achieve some of the normative goals of anarchism as well.
2722000	2733000	Because otherwise people might hear you talk and think, oh, well, Thomas is trying to get into the business of business consulting.
2733000	2740000	So how is this in line with coming to a post-capitalist anarchist cybernetic world, so to speak?
2740000	2744000	But it actually is helpful as well.
2744000	2749000	And I think it would be important for us to kind of carve out how and why.
2749000	2763000	And one way of doing it would be through taking some of these core principles and trying to figure out what they mean within anarchism and what they mean within cybernetics.
2763000	2778000	So you already mentioned self-organization a couple of times and how this was one of the gateways that led you to cybernetics because you immediately thought, all right, this is something of an interesting overlap.
2778000	2785000	So could you maybe explain what self-organization means within the different fields?
2785000	2792000	Yes. So I think in cybernetics, self-organization is just quite a technical term.
2792000	2798000	It's quite a sort of descriptive technical term for how a system is organized.
2798000	2803000	And, you know, an electronic system or a mechanical system can be self-organized.
2803000	2810000	So the sort of classic example is the steam engine, which has a certain part of the mechanism.
2810000	2815000	It's a thing called a governor, which is basically a way to regulate speed.
2815000	2825000	So as the engine speeds up, the governor, you know, kind of, well, it's hard to sort of describe it without a picture in front of me.
2825000	2835000	But as the engine speeds up, the governor responds to that speed and the way it responds slows the system down.
2835000	2839000	So it's a way where the system can regulate itself.
2839000	2849000	Thermostats do that as well. Okay, you know, thermostats, when the room gets above a certain temperature, the air conditioning will come on and bring the temperature back down.
2849000	2858000	So in cybernetics terms, that's self-organized, right? Because no one's having to manually adjust the speed of the engine.
2858000	2867000	I'm not in my room having to constantly go back and turn the air conditioning on when it gets too hot and then turn it off again when it's too cold.
2867000	2870000	The thermostat does that itself.
2870000	2876000	Obviously, that's very different from how we think about self-organization in political terms.
2876000	2893000	So when we're talking about self-organization in political terms, it's, on the one hand, taking in that kind of technical definition of saying, okay, how can a collective, a community, a cooperative, a social movement,
2893000	2912000	how can it perform the tasks that it wants to perform, achieve the goals that it wants to achieve in a sort of self-regulating way where it doesn't need a leadership clique or a leadership party to actually do the controlling.
2912000	2918000	It just does it itself through how it's organized and how it communicates.
2918000	2939000	So there is that technical element in there, but there's also importantly the political element, which is very much saying, well, okay, self-organization is actually about everyone being able to participate in the decisions that have any impact on their lives.
2939000	2948000	So it's about a sort of participatory and democratic way of organizing in any kind of community or collective.
2948000	2965000	So in that way, self-organization is less about how technically efficient it is or effective it is and much more about, well, it allows us to develop ourselves in a sort of free and autonomous way, both collectively and as individuals.
2965000	2972000	And for the anarchists, this is very, very closely linked to ideas of human flourishing.
2972000	2988000	So how can we actually develop ourselves as some kind of rounded, happy individuals with the kind of resources for genuine well-being?
2988000	2996000	How can we do that in a community which is collectively self-organized?
2996000	3009000	So how is my individual freedom linked to the collective process of self-organization where we are as a group free and autonomous and making our own decisions?
3009000	3020000	So I think self-organization is these two different things. It's on the one hand, the technical thing of this is the most effective way of organizing systems.
3020000	3034000	And also the political thing of this is the way that communities or collectives can be organized that gives us the most freedom, that gives us the most opportunity.
3034000	3042000	Yeah, that gives us the most opportunity for collective and individual autonomy and fulfillment.
3042000	3046000	And I think anarchism has always had its eye on both of these.
3046000	3058000	So even if you look back to some of the classical anarchists, like Peter Kropotkin, who was an anarchist geographer writing at the end of the 19th century and started the 20th century,
3058000	3075000	he very much sees anarchism as being a politically desirable system of governance, whereby people have more freedom, people are happier, people have more well-being, people are able to look after themselves much better, they have better economic standards.
3075000	3088000	But also a much more effective way of organizing society, because he says, well, the state is this very slow, very cumbersome, very blunt tool for trying to organize society.
3088000	3100000	If we can do this autonomously, we allow for much more harmony with nature. It allows us to have a much better alignment with how nature operates.
3100000	3111000	And we can build our communities in ways that are more sustainable with the way that change and the way that self-organization happens in natural systems as well.
3111000	3125000	Maybe I would add, and this is maybe already a learning, so to speak, also from the experiences, for example, in the movement of the squares.
3125000	3135000	Since you point out that ideally you have these two elements of self-organization as two sides of the same coin.
3135000	3147000	So you have the normative ideal of self-organization as well as effective self-organization through allowing a form of distributed control, so to speak.
3148000	3163000	I would maybe add that I understood the book as if you wanted to say that you can have both of these, but in order to get them, you would have to organize in a specific way.
3163000	3174000	So it's not that you can just merely decentralize as people might have thought about anarchism for actually a long period.
3174000	3184000	You cannot do merely that and think that you can have the effective side of self-organization as well.
3184000	3192000	But you would have to think about the ways in which the organization is structured in a very specific way, and that's why you take the VSM.
3192000	3195000	And I already mentioned control.
3195000	3209000	I think it would be good to maybe take a look at this term as well, because this is something that might lead to some misunderstandings specifically amongst anarchist circles, I would say.
3209000	3220000	Because, of course, there might be a reflex to think that control is like immediate control of domination, the domination of one person over another.
3220000	3225000	But within cybernetics, this is thought of very differently.
3225000	3231000	So could you maybe elaborate how the term control is being used in the context of anarchist cybernetics?
3231000	3233000	And then we will go from there.
3233000	3235000	Yeah, so I think you're totally right.
3235000	3247000	I think there's a few sort of pieces of terminology in thinking about anarchist cybernetics that do rub up against how we typically think of anarchist politics.
3247000	3250000	And I think control is definitely one of them.
3250000	3258000	So typically, we think of control as command and control hierarchies, where control means domination.
3258000	3269000	It means someone subordinating someone else, someone following the orders from someone above them, that person above them is in control of them.
3269000	3276000	And I think what cybernetics allows us to do is think about that in a very, very different way.
3276000	3298000	So control is much more, as I've sort of discussed already, the way self-organization operates in systems, according to cybernetics, the most sort of effective way for self-organization to operate is without any kind of centralized or external control.
3298000	3302000	So we think, well, what's actually happening in these systems?
3302000	3306000	They are still coordinated. They are still making complex decisions.
3306000	3315000	They are still responding in a coordinated and collective way to changes and complexity in their environments.
3315000	3318000	And that is all happening through control.
3318000	3322000	So the system, in a sense, controls itself.
3322000	3330000	So that's where self-organization, so self-control, and it's much less even the term self-control.
3330000	3336000	And we think of self-control as like the individual trying to control our passions in some way.
3336000	3349000	It's much less of that. It's much more, you know, if we're in a group of people and we make a decision collectively, we agree on something and we do that, then we have control over ourselves.
3349000	3354000	We've been able to do something coordinated and in an effective and democratic way.
3354000	3357000	So that's how control operates.
3357000	3363000	I think there's a few sort of metaphors for how control operates in cybernetics.
3363000	3374000	So Elena Leonard, who's one of the sort of foremost authors within the sort of organizational cybernetics tradition, described it as a kind of balancing.
3374000	3379000	So if you imagine one of the sort of metaphors is like someone skiing downhill.
3379000	3383000	So, I mean, I've never skied, but I can kind of imagine what skiing is like.
3383000	3385000	You know, you're kind of moving from side to side.
3385000	3395000	You're kind of adapting to the environment, shifting with how the ground changes, what's in front of you.
3395000	3401000	You're in some kind of self-organized control where you're feeding back from the environment.
3401000	3403000	You're taking in what's happening around about you.
3403000	3405000	You're steering yourself in subtle ways.
3405000	3411000	It's not sort of there's not somebody on the outside pulling your strings, essentially.
3411000	3420000	I think another really, really nice metaphor for this, and this is in a book by a Dutch anarchist, Roel van Daan.
3420000	3423000	So he wrote a book called Message of a Wise Kabouter.
3424000	3431000	So Kabouter is a kind of gnome, and he describes Peter Kropotkin as a kind of gnome-like figure.
3431000	3434000	So gnome's like sort of short with big beards.
3434000	3442000	And for van Daan, there's an element of gnomes live in a more harmonious way with nature.
3442000	3448000	But he describes it, possibly a very, very Dutch example, in terms of riding a bicycle.
3448000	3451000	So he says, OK, so you're riding a bicycle.
3451000	3454000	Obviously, you're steering, so you're in control that way.
3454000	3457000	But there's also there's wind coming in from different sides.
3457000	3465000	The wind maybe blows you, and so you lean very, very slightly to one side to sort of counteract the wind.
3465000	3472000	Maybe you go around a corner, so you lean in a slightly different way to allow yourself to go around the corner on the bicycle.
3472000	3476000	All of these are parts of a sort of very subtle system of control.
3476000	3479000	It's taking information from the environment.
3479000	3480000	The wind's blowing this way.
3480000	3482000	I'm feeling that in myself.
3482000	3487000	I'm feeling myself be shifted one way so I can subtly lean the other way.
3487000	3489000	It's not even necessarily totally conscious.
3489000	3493000	It's something we probably do quite well, at least if we're used to cycling.
3493000	3497000	We do it quite naturally without thinking about it.
3497000	3503000	And I think that kind of control, so imagining someone cycling and responding to the wind
3503000	3507000	and managing to keep themselves going, I think is really, really important.
3507000	3512000	But I think the metaphor of the bicycle is really, really interesting for me because
3512000	3516000	it tells us how important the environment is here.
3516000	3523000	So if you imagine cycling on a bicycle track or a bicycle lane,
3523000	3529000	if that bicycle lane had incredibly sharp corners in it,
3529000	3532000	you'd really, really struggle to get around those corners.
3532000	3537000	You'd have to step off the bike and turn the bike around and then start again.
3537000	3541000	I'm sure in Germany you've got really, really good bicycle lanes.
3541000	3547000	In the UK, we either have none or if we do have them, they're just useless and terrible.
3547000	3552000	So I think for me that tells us how important the environmental conditions are
3552000	3558000	to how we can have that self-organized kind of control.
3559000	3563000	It's not just about what we do as an organization, as a collective,
3563000	3567000	it's also about the environment we're in and how the environment is structured.
3567000	3572000	Does the environment allow us to have some kind of self-organization
3572000	3578000	and have that kind of balancing idea of control?
3578000	3584000	And there are some very nice kind of phrases within your book as well
3584000	3588000	which try to give an idea of how this relation is thought of.
3588000	3592000	For example, control is in each function not top-down
3592000	3597000	or the control function is spread throughout the architecture of the system.
3597000	3602000	So this very much highlights this idea of not having one centralized body
3602000	3607000	that gives out orders and everybody else is supposed to follow.
3607000	3614000	However, and this is something that we definitely will have to talk about
3614000	3618000	and which is very interesting I think in the way that you approach this,
3618000	3624000	anarchist cybernetics does not say that there is full autonomy for everybody
3624000	3632000	so that everybody could simply do what he or she or they might want to do in a given situation
3632000	3638000	and actually approach some form of highly individualistic autonomy so to speak.
3638000	3647000	Instead, you try to approach the question of autonomy as well as the question of freedom and hierarchy
3647000	3651000	and you try to approach these questions from a different angle.
3651000	3657000	So you propose, for example, functional hierarchy instead of structural hierarchy.
3657000	3663000	So maybe let's take a look at these different elements and start with the question of hierarchy.
3663000	3667000	What's the difference between the two forms of hierarchy that you describe,
3667000	3674000	functional hierarchy and structural hierarchy, and why might functional hierarchy serve us better?
3674000	3678000	Yes, so the distinction between functional and structural hierarchy,
3678000	3685000	so that's something that comes from Gordon Pask who is another of the really sort of influential cyberneticians
3685000	3691000	in the post-World War II years, a very close friend of Stafford Beers.
3691000	3698000	His interest is more in communication systems and electronic systems.
3698000	3703000	He's less interested in social systems although he uses them as examples an awful lot
3703000	3705000	and he is very political in what he writes.
3705000	3711000	He makes this distinction to try and say we have the sort of structural hierarchy within a system
3711000	3717000	which is within an organization is how we would typically think of a hierarchical organizational chart.
3717000	3719000	So you have the boss at the top.
3719000	3725000	You maybe have sort of senior managers and below them you maybe have middle managers
3725000	3728000	and then you have maybe workers at the very bottom.
3728000	3731000	But essentially you have a sort of top-down decision-making structure.
3731000	3736000	So it's hierarchical in the sense that decisions are made at the top
3737000	3742000	and then those decisions are fed down through the hierarchy to people at the bottom
3742000	3744000	who just have to implement those decisions.
3744000	3749000	They don't have any autonomy, any say in anything, no decision-making power.
3749000	3751000	They just implement those decisions.
3751000	3758000	So that's a structural hierarchy and that's obviously the kind of thing that anarchists are,
3758000	3763000	as a kind of starting point for anarchism, very much opposed to.
3764000	3767000	Functional hierarchy is something quite different.
3767000	3777000	So functional hierarchy is instead saying that there is a kind of logical ordering of decision-making
3777000	3784000	whereby some decisions come logically prior to other decisions.
3784000	3790000	So one way of thinking about this is in terms of kind of strategy and tactics distinction.
3790000	3797000	As I mentioned looking at the VSM, you have this higher function metasystemic part of the system
3797000	3803000	which is where things like grand strategy and strategy are developed.
3803000	3809000	In terms of thinking about this as a kind of effective organization,
3809000	3815000	those are decisions that come before the operational or tactical decisions.
3815000	3821000	So in order for us to know what tactics are going to be best to us,
3821000	3829000	in order for us to know how we can best operate in the kind of day-to-day of an organization,
3829000	3832000	we need to have a strategy first.
3832000	3837000	So we develop a strategy that tells us these are our goals, these are our aims,
3837000	3841000	these are the values and principles that we have, these are our priorities.
3841000	3844000	This is what we need to maximize and minimize.
3844000	3853000	And that helps us decide on what kind of tactics, what kind of day-to-day actions we can take.
3853000	3857000	So in a sense, there's a sort of hierarchical ordering there.
3857000	3861000	Strategy comes above tactics.
3861000	3869000	And obviously in typical organizations, that functional hierarchy and the structural hierarchy are meshed together.
3869000	3874000	So you have the strategic decisions are taken by the bosses, by the managers,
3874000	3880000	and the tactical stuff, the actions, the day-to-day actions are things that workers are doing.
3880000	3886000	And they just take the orders and do the actions as they're told to do.
3886000	3893000	What I think anarchist cybernetics opens up, I think this is something that's in cybernetics anyway,
3893000	3901000	but I think an anarchist focus in cybernetics helps us reinforce this and helps us see how important this is.
3901000	3907000	I think we can have the functional hierarchy so we can have the logical ordering of decision-making
3907000	3913000	where one decision has to be made in order for us to be able to make the other decision.
3913000	3916000	So one decision is higher than the other.
3916000	3921000	We can have that logical ordering, can have that hierarchy of decision-making
3921000	3925000	without the structural hierarchy.
3925000	3928000	So as I said, looking at the VSM and that example of the CAFE,
3928000	3933000	the people who are doing the day-to-day activities, the people who are doing the tactical action,
3933000	3938000	which is functionally lower than the strategic decision-making,
3938000	3943000	they are the same people who are doing the strategic decision-making.
3943000	3949000	There's not a manager who's making those strategy decisions, there's not a boss who's making those decisions.
3949000	3954000	It's the same people who are doing the serving, the making the drinks, the cooking,
3954000	3962000	they at a certain point stop doing that and they go into a meeting or they go into a discussion,
3962000	3967000	they go into some kind of forum where they're doing the strategy stuff.
3967000	3972000	So it's very much saying we can have the functional ordering of decision-making
3972000	3976000	where some decisions have to come first and then we can make other ones,
3977000	3984000	but everybody in the organization can be involved at all levels of that functional hierarchy.
3984000	3992000	So it doesn't require a structural hierarchy where certain decisions can only be made
3992000	3996000	by people higher up in the organization.
3996000	4005000	And I want to add maybe for the audience that is on the critical side of things when it comes to cybernetics,
4005000	4014000	I want to add that since we do already have cybernetics very much within our world today
4014000	4021000	acting as actually maybe even already at least in some parts hegemonic principle,
4021000	4025000	I would like to add that if you take a look at capitalist cybernetics
4025000	4031000	and the way in which huge companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, whatever,
4031000	4037000	apply cybernetic thinking that they do exactly what you just mentioned.
4037000	4041000	They collapse functional hierarchy and structural hierarchy
4041000	4046000	and they try to make use of elements of functional hierarchy
4046000	4051000	where lower elements within the organization might have some limited autonomy
4051000	4057000	in order to become more effective, but they do still keep the structural hierarchy
4057000	4061000	in which at the end you do have the bosses, you do have the managers,
4061000	4064000	you do have the people who will tell you what to do,
4064000	4068000	and this is very much structured along strong hierarchy.
4068000	4074000	So this is something I actually want to point out at this point, I would say.
4074000	4083000	And again, I think this also shows how this lens is actually very fruitful as an analytic lens
4083000	4085000	because it makes you see the difference.
4085000	4089000	So this is something I really like when reading your book.
4089000	4095000	And still, when it comes to anarchist cybernetics,
4095000	4102000	we do have to point out that, as I said, it's not about having unrestricted autonomy
4102000	4106000	since you do have these elements of grand strategy,
4106000	4112000	you do have these elements everybody will have to be on board with, so to speak,
4112000	4120000	and because of that, you automatically have some boundaries in terms of your own individual autonomy
4120000	4129000	because it actually is a logical result of having decisions being made collectively beforehand
4129000	4138000	and yourself having to kind of align with this overarching identity and principles of the organization, so to speak.
4138000	4141000	So maybe let's talk about this relation.
4141000	4147000	Let's talk about this question of autonomy that is implicit within this relation
4147000	4153000	because both in anarchism and cybernetics, autonomy plays a very crucial role.
4153000	4160000	However, again, we find very different understandings of what autonomy means in the respective fields.
4160000	4164000	Stafford B identifies three constraints on autonomy,
4164000	4167000	and this is specifically interesting when it comes to anarchist cybernetics
4167000	4172000	because some of these constraints seem to, at least at first sight,
4172000	4177000	go against the grain of some of the core principles of anarchist organization.
4177000	4180000	Again, we have to say.
4180000	4188000	But I think you do a good job in the book in pointing out why these constraints are actually not only necessary,
4188000	4191000	but also compatible with an anarchist approach.
4191000	4194000	And these constraints are, and I will read them out.
4194000	4197000	This is a quote by Stafford Beer.
4197000	4204000	The first of the constraints would be autonomous parts must operate in coordination with other autonomous parts.
4204000	4211000	The second one is autonomous parts must operate within the intentions of the whole organization.
4211000	4213000	And this would be the third one.
4213000	4219000	Autonomous parts must face the possibility of being excluded from the organization as a whole.
4219000	4222000	So these are the three constraints.
4222000	4227000	What is the understanding of autonomy in anarchist cybernetics?
4227000	4237000	Yes, I think as you sort of suggested, it first does seem like it clashes with how we may understand autonomy or freedom.
4237000	4240000	I think I'm collapsing these terms, autonomy and freedom.
4240000	4246000	There's a discussion about whether there's a distinction between them, but I'm kind of collapsing them a bit.
4246000	4259000	There is a definite question here about does the understanding of autonomy that's in cybernetics fundamentally clash with how we understand it in anarchism?
4259000	4269000	So I think going through those three principles that you just read out, I think for the first two, there's not necessarily a problem there.
4269000	4275000	So, you know, saying that the autonomous parts have to be in coordination with other autonomous parts.
4275000	4285000	You know, that's just that sort of fundamental thing of saying, okay, my autonomy shouldn't constrain your autonomy and your autonomy shouldn't constrain my autonomy.
4285000	4301000	So, okay, we can be autonomous, but we have to sort of coordinate that autonomy so that, you know, like me trying to be free or be autonomous doesn't prevent you from being free or being autonomous.
4301000	4305000	We have to just make sure there's some kind of coordination there.
4305000	4321000	And that might mean certain limits on what we can do as individuals, but ultimately it's there so that, you know, there's a sort of maximum amount of autonomy that means that everyone can still enjoy it.
4321000	4328000	The second part I think also doesn't necessarily immediately suggest a clash with anarchism.
4328000	4337000	So thinking about, well, the autonomous parts of an organization need to operate within the intentions of the whole organization.
4337000	4344000	So that's something kind of, you know, fairly accepted within a lot of anarchist organizations.
4344000	4353000	Yes, different parts of a federation or different branches of an organization will have some autonomy.
4353000	4362000	They'll have some sort of freedom to make their own decisions in their own environments and their own environmental niches.
4362000	4365000	But they're still part of the organization as a whole.
4365000	4377000	And there's going to be some decisions which are kind of higher level of and a certain functionally higher level of decision making, where they might not have complete autonomy.
4377000	4380000	So because they're still part of the whole organization.
4380000	4391000	So, for example, if this is an anarchist trade union, for example, there's going to be different branches of that trade union, which have autonomy to do maybe organize on different priorities.
4391000	4403000	They pick their own campaigns, divide up, you know, workloads in their own autonomous ways, raise money themselves, manage their finances themselves in autonomous ways.
4403000	4410000	But there's going to be some kind of key organizational principles that they don't have autonomy over.
4410000	4415000	So, for example, I'm thinking of the industrial workers of the world here.
4415000	4441000	You know, part of their sort of fundamental, you know, the fundamental starting point for this for their politics is that people who are bosses or people who have any power over any direct power over hiring and firing workers can't be a member of the union, because then they're on the boss side rather than on the worker side.
4441000	4454000	So if a particular branch of the IWW said, you know, we'd we'd quite like to invite this boss and because he seems like a nice person, got seems like they've got good politics, talks good, we're friends with them.
4454000	4456000	We want to them to be a member.
4456000	4459000	That's not going to be possible within that organization.
4459000	4466000	So their autonomy is restricted there by virtue of the fact that they're part of this larger organization.
4466000	4472000	So I think that's not necessarily an issue for or doesn't present itself as an issue for anarchists.
4472000	4479000	I think the third principle that you mentioned is perhaps where we might imagine there's a more fundamental clash.
4479000	4487000	So the idea that there's a kind of ultimate restriction on autonomy, which is being excluded from the organization.
4487000	4506000	So there's a point when for whatever reason, a certain part of the organization or a certain individual might be excluded, might be kicked out of the organization, whatever kind of organization as a federation, collective, whatever.
4506000	4515000	And that's something I think some anarchists may at first find issue with because they'd say, well, no, we don't want to be excluding people.
4515000	4523000	We don't want to be, you know, doing that horrible thing of saying to someone, yeah, you're no longer part of the group.
4523000	4526000	We don't want you in this organization.
4526000	4531000	We're going to evict you or expel you or whatever.
4531000	4539000	But actually this is something which happens, maybe not regularly, but it is a tool within the kind of anarchist toolbox.
4539000	4551000	So particularly if we think about things like when certain individuals have been accused of committing sexual assault, for example,
4551000	4562000	and maybe haven't been part of the sort of the kind of transformative justice process within a collective is saying, we'll have some kind of accountability process.
4562000	4567000	We'll have some kind of process of mediation and where hopefully we can still all live together.
4567000	4576000	You know, the person who committed the assault can hopefully learn what they did wrong and, you know, grow as a person and won't do that again.
4576000	4586000	The person who is who is the victim accepts that that process is fair and thinks, yeah, OK, we can we can still exist as a collective.
4586000	4589000	But then there might be a problem, a point where that breaks down.
4589000	4600000	And actually, it's impossible for, you know, the person who committed the sexual assault to actually remain part of that collective or part of that community.
4600000	4606000	It's no longer considered safe for the other people, for them to be part of that community.
4606000	4615000	And that's that's the kind of worst case scenario, perhaps in terms of thinking about anarchists and radical approaches to justice.
4615000	4617000	But it is something that happens.
4617000	4629000	And when that happens, you know, expelling a person from the organization and evicting them from from the community is a kind of tool that people have in that circumstance.
4629000	4639000	So it is something that it's something we don't don't like to acknowledge as being, hey, here's the things we can do.
4639000	4643000	We can do this, this and this. And one of them is we can expel you if you do these things.
4643000	4656000	But it is there. It is there as a kind of if if if this goes as horribly as we can possibly imagine and we can no longer have this person in the organization, in the community, in the collective,
4656000	4667000	then expelling them is is an option. And for most anarchist groups, that will be part of how they how they can resolve these kind of conflicts.
4667000	4670000	As I said, worst case, but it is still there.
4670000	4688000	So I think that that potential for expulsion is is something we maybe don't want to be doing, but it's something we recognize as anarchists that there may still be a necessity for that at certain times.
4688000	4696000	And I think it does raise a lot of issues of, well, where does that person go? Right. Does that person just is that person just out in the wilderness now?
4696000	4713000	Are they how how are they going to learn from this? How are they going to change? Does it really does it really change the underlying structural situations around things like like sexual assault and violence?
4713000	4727000	How does it help us transform as a community? It raises a lot of questions, but it is still still an important part of trying to deal with conflict and deal with justice and more more anarchistic ways.
4727000	4745000	And maybe because this might lead to forms of misunderstanding as well, because when you talked about part one within these constraints about autonomous parts must operate in coordination with other autonomous parts,
4745000	4755000	and you framed it in a way that points out that you have your freedoms, I have my freedoms, and as long as they don't infringe on each other, it's all fine.
4755000	4768000	But the part within the book about autonomy very much highlights how individual freedom is a product of collective freedom and not vice versa.
4768000	4778000	And and I think this is just something that I would like to add, because it might otherwise lead to misunderstandings.
4778000	4788000	When people hear you talk about these individuals and not infringing on the freedom of others, because this is, of course, one of the ways that it is being conceptualized.
4789000	4804000	For example, in liberalism, you have these nomads, these individual nomads that are enacting in contractual relations with each other and very much thought of through a lens of methodological individualism.
4804000	4808000	And that's not the way that you approach it, I would say.
4808000	4811000	Yeah, definitely. I think that that's really important.
4811000	4822000	So when we do look at something like those sort of restrictions on individual autonomy, it's not coming from that methodological individualist starting point.
4822000	4831000	It's very much saying any kind of individual freedom is a product of the collective existing, of being part of a community.
4831000	4838000	So it's not that you have these autonomous individuals who come into an organization and then have to coordinate.
4838000	4846000	It's that the organization or the community produces the kind of autonomy and the freedom that these individuals have.
4846000	4859000	But part of that process of producing that freedom is a coordination so that the sort of freedoms and autonomies are kind of balanced and work together and don't conflict with one another.
4859000	4863000	And I think that's something we see in anarchism going way back.
4863000	4883000	That recognition of individuality and individual freedom are a product of community and a product of collective organization rather than the kind of liberal starting point, which is we're individuals and we can maybe for our mutual benefit cooperate.
4883000	4886000	It's much more cooperation comes first.
4886000	4901000	And this is also, I think, very much important because it points towards the importance of how this collective element comes about.
4901000	4924000	Because if it comes about in a participatory way, then the likelihood of the individuals that are engaging with this collective of agreeing with the limitations on their own autonomy is, of course, much higher than if not.
4924000	4931000	And I think this very much relates to this question of grand strategy or within the VSM.
4931000	4943000	It's called system five and how these overarching goals, this grand strategy actually comes about, how it is being developed.
4943000	4972000	Because this is the crucial point where anarchist cybernetics is very much different from, as I already pointed out, for example, capitalist cybernetics, because this level of grand strategy, this level five within the VSM, is very much part of a participatory process as well and needs to come about through such a process.
4972000	4992000	And I think immediately some questions pop up as well, because if you think of it in a larger context, if you think of anarchist cybernetics as something that might eventually inform society wide organization, then the question of scale comes into mind immediately.
4992000	5021000	Because if you want the level five elements, the grand strategy elements to come about in a participatory way through consensus decisions, for example, then you will have a problem if you have a large quantity of people and you will have to find ways to address this in a way that still leads to this legitimization through process that is actually a constitutive element of anarchist cybernetics.
5021000	5030000	So how would this level five function, this grand strategy come about within anarchist cybernetics also on a scale?
5030000	5053000	Yeah, so I think one of the best examples I think of, well, I think the starting point is thinking, well, what is this system five? So what is grand strategy? So the way I understand it and the way it's stood in cybernetics is thinking about the identity or the ethos of a particular organization or particular community.
5053000	5071000	So what are the kind of core principles? What are the, what is the sort of paradigm or worldview of a particular community? What is the core elements of how that community views itself and understands itself as a community with a certain identity?
5071000	5081000	And that's because that embodies things like, you know, values and principles, thinking about, you know, that sort of functional hierarchy of decision making.
5081000	5104000	You know, that sort of, that system five level of, or grand strategic level of values and principles, identity, that then determines what kind of practical strategies are going to be developed in an organization, which then in turn determines what kind of tactics are going to be appropriate within the organization.
5104000	5117000	So there's a strong link between the day to day activities and how they are considered to be appropriate for the organization and the kind of identity and the ethos and the values and principles that that organization has.
5117000	5127000	So how that actually comes about in anarchist cybernetics is really, really, really important question.
5128000	5140000	There are elements of it which are, which make up an almost a kind of common sense within a particular, you know, political milieu or political tradition.
5140000	5152000	So some of it's going to be things that maybe isn't ever, ever even explicitly discussed or isn't even ever, you know, the subject of an actual concrete decision that people make.
5152000	5164000	It might be that the people involved come into an organization or come into a setting or decide to form a kind of community or just want to think about who are we as a group.
5164000	5168000	We already exist as a group, but let's think about who we are as a group.
5168000	5175000	There might be things that are just so taken for granted that they never have to be a decision made about them.
5175000	5179000	They're just a common sense almost.
5179000	5199000	So, for example, you know, thinking about, again, going back to the example of the Industrial Workers of the World Trade Union, you know, part of the sort of common sense, the sort of taking for granted common sense of that organization is the particular political view of economic exploitation, right?
5199000	5213000	There are, you know, wealthy capitalists who own the means for production, and there are the working class who have to sell their labor in order to survive.
5213000	5225000	I think if you go to a IWW meeting, even a big sort of strategic meeting today, they're not going to be saying, okay, do we still agree with this? Do we still do it? Do we need to reaffirm our agreement to this principle?
5225000	5229000	That's just the kind of common sense for that whole politics.
5229000	5233000	So that's part of their identity, part of their worldview.
5233000	5237000	But there's going to be elements of it that do need to be discussed at some point.
5237000	5244000	And I think one of the fruitful ways of thinking about that is through things like constitutions.
5244000	5247000	So you said about how groups constitute themselves.
5247000	5253000	And part of that is thinking about, well, what values do we all agree on?
5253000	5265000	What kind of identity do we all share as people in this organization or different organizations within a kind of federation of some kind?
5265000	5268000	So that process can be quite explicit in those terms.
5268000	5285000	And if we look back at something like Occupy Wall Street, they had participatory, collective, democratic processes of writing and agreeing on a declaration.
5285000	5300000	So it's kind of trying to mirror the idea of the US Declaration of Independence, which was obviously written by a few white men, a lot of them slave owners, all kind of wealthy landowners.
5300000	5309000	What Occupy did was say, okay, we need to create a declaration for ourselves as a community, but we're going to do that in a democratic way.
5309000	5315000	We're going to do that in a participatory way, and it's going to be based on everyone taking part in that process.
5315000	5324000	So that's a much more explicit way of doing that kind of system five grand strategy of saying we can define who we are as a community.
5324000	5332000	We can define what our core principles are, what our values are, and we can write that in a document.
5332000	5336000	So they produced the kind of declaration of Occupy Wall Street.
5336000	5342000	So that was their sort of founding document.
5342000	5344000	So I think there's ways that you can do that in organizations.
5344000	5351000	I know in sort of smaller organizations like workers cooperatives, there's going to be some kind of constitution.
5351000	5365000	There's going to be some kind of founding statement or statement or principles, which at some point in the organization, you might either need to write from scratch or you might need to, if it already exists,
5365000	5369000	you know, go back to it and change things as time goes on.
5369000	5372000	So those documents aren't necessarily fixed forever.
5372000	5380000	They can maybe change in some ways, although some elements might be less changeable than others.
5380000	5382000	But I think how you then scale that up.
5382000	5386000	So it worked well for, you can imagine it working in a small workers cooperative.
5386000	5391000	If there's like 10 people, you say, well, we can get together for a day and we can just work this out.
5391000	5392000	Okay, great.
5392000	5393000	Occupy Wall Street.
5393000	5396000	Okay, a few thousand people took part in that.
5396000	5398000	Still relatively small groups.
5398000	5406000	And they developed really, really good ways of making sure everyone could take part, making sure everyone could feed ideas in, but still relatively small group.
5406000	5417000	How do we do that at the scale of something like the size of a city or even a country?
5417000	5429000	Well, then we need to think about some of the really, really interesting examples around the world of more participatory processes for writing a national constitution.
5429000	5445000	So none of these are anarchists in any way, but I think they do have a lot of really important lessons for anarchism in the sense that they start to show us how a community at that scale.
5445000	5460000	So, you know, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people can do this kind of system five grand strategy and how they can do that in a way that's more participatory than it traditionally has been done.
5460000	5474000	So traditionally, a document like a national constitution is maybe written by a small number of constitutional legal experts and maybe some involvement from politicians.
5474000	5481000	Maybe there's some kind of consultation that feeds into it so that the people in the country have some kind of say in it.
5481000	5488000	Maybe it goes to, you know, vote afterwards for people have to approve this new constitution.
5488000	5500000	But with a lot of cases around the world, there's a lot of examples of people trying to say, how can we open this process up and make it much more participatory?
5500000	5509000	Involve much more people, not just in throwing ideas in and then approving the document, but actually taking part in writing it.
5509000	5516000	And I think one of the examples I've studied, there's lots of others, but one of the examples I've studied is Iceland.
5516000	5521000	So they went through a process which hasn't been successful yet.
5521000	5524000	But it was a really interesting process nonetheless.
5524000	5532000	After the 2008 financial crash, they decided to try and rewrite the national constitution.
5532000	5535000	But the way they did that, they wanted it to be more participatory.
5535000	5547000	They thought, well, we want everyone in the country to have more of a direct say in how this document looks, because this document is ultimately saying, this is who we are as a community.
5547000	5553000	And this is what we believe in. And these are our fundamental principles and values.
5553000	5556000	So they tried to find ways of making it more participatory.
5556000	5567000	It still wasn't, you know, participatory in the way that anarchists would like, but it does start to point us in the direction of, you know, this is something we can do now.
5567000	5570000	And we've got the tools to do this now.
5571000	5577000	We can use a lot of the kind of digital tools that have been developed recently, a lot of the communication technologies.
5577000	5585000	These make it much easier for lots of different people in a large area to take part in the discussion.
5585000	5591000	And it doesn't need to be, you know, everyone in one big, you know, general assembly.
5591000	5597000	We're not talking about having a Zoom call with like three million people trying to trying to agree on something.
5597000	5602000	You can sort of decentralize this and split this up into small working groups.
5602000	5608000	So it might be different parts of the community in different geographical areas have their discussions.
5608000	5616000	And then they have delegates that feed those discussions into some kind of slightly more centralized council or committee.
5616000	5619000	There may be different special interests groups.
5619000	5634000	You might have, you know, like Occupy Wall Street did, you had People of Color Caucus so that people of color in Occupy Wall Street had some kind of representation in the decision making structures.
5634000	5644000	So you can have, there's different ways of sort of organizing that kind of mass participation that's still democratic, that's still participatory.
5644000	5651000	But that doesn't mean we're just saying let's get everyone together and try and discuss and agree on something.
5651000	5656000	So it's a more and more effective way of doing it that kind of breaks it up in little ways.
5656000	5661000	And also a process that makes sure that it's not always the same people that engage in it.
5661000	5668000	Because, I mean, that's a bit of a problem with the participatory approach is that at least as societies are organized right now,
5668000	5681000	if you simply say let's do it in a participatory fashion, then you will have some people that have actually the luxury to have free time in order to participate and others do not and stuff like that.
5681000	5684000	So this needs to be addressed as well, of course.
5684000	5699000	But OK, so I mean, what I can hear here is that you're leaning towards some form of anarchist constitutionalism in order to address this question of system five and grand strategy, actually.
5699000	5706000	We kind of talked a lot about organization up until now within this conversation.
5706000	5714000	But your book actually has a second part, which is not about organization, but about communication.
5714000	5722000	And some might remember Norbert Wiener's book title, Cybernetics, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.
5722000	5727000	And you equally highlight both of these elements, control and communication.
5727000	5730000	So maybe let's turn towards the communication part.
5730000	5733000	What is it that communication does?
5733000	5738000	What role does it play in anarchist cybernetics?
5738000	5750000	So I think really fundamentally for cybernetics in general, thinking about self-organization is at the same time thinking about communication.
5750000	5762000	So thinking about how information is gathered and processed and shared and distributed within a system is incredibly central to that.
5762000	5772000	So one of the sort of primary mechanisms within a self-organized system is feedback loops.
5772000	5779000	So, you know, what was talking about when I talked about the kind of steam engine governor or the thermostat, that's a kind of feedback loop.
5779000	5781000	And it operates through information.
5781000	5799000	So, you know, the thermostat, as the temperature in the room increases, there's the sort of temperature sensor in the thermostat that sends information to a different part of the thermostat, which turns the air conditioning on, for example.
5799000	5813000	So that communication in that sense of information being taken in from the environment and shared in the system and then an action being the outcome of that information is really fundamental to cybernetics.
5813000	5833000	And some of the more sort of technical and I think sort of, yeah, looking at cybernetics in terms of electronic systems and mechanical systems, a lot of the focus was on how do we make these communication pathways and channels more efficient?
5833000	5844000	So how do we minimize noise in these systems? How do we ensure that information is, you know, intact when it gets to the point of the system where it needs to be?
5844000	5852000	So how does it get from, you know, the sort of sensor that's measuring something in the environment?
5852000	5858000	How does that information then get to the part of the system where the action needs to happen?
5858000	5873000	So that's really important for a lot that's a more technical side of cybernetics, but I think it's also incredibly important in thinking about how self-organization operates in social systems.
5873000	5882000	Because everything I've kind of talked about so far in terms of organization, this is all requires interaction between parts of a system.
5882000	5887000	And that interaction is communication.
5887000	5891000	Sometimes it will be people literally talking to one another.
5891000	5899000	Sometimes it will be, you know, monitoring of different parts of the environment or what's happening within the organization.
5899000	5904000	Sometimes it might be, you know, just a kind of physical interaction.
5904000	5911000	I mean, one of the examples I often think of is working behind a bar.
5911000	5920000	So I don't know if you've ever worked in a bar, but, you know, when you first start working with people and it's busy, you're constantly bumping into each other.
5920000	5924000	You have this sort of physical and eventually you sort of learn to move around each other.
5924000	5930000	You sort of have this, yeah, you kind of self-organize as a kind of system behind the bar.
5930000	5942000	But, you know, that sort of physical bumping in, that's the kind of communication as well, because that's sending a information signal of, right, I need to move this way instead, or we need to go a different direction kind of thing.
5942000	5963000	So all of this kind of coordination, all this self-organization is about, you know, communicating and making sure information moves through the system in, you know, effective ways that allow people to know what's happening and make decisions as a result of what's happening.
5963000	5979000	So also in terms of strategy, you know, strategy can't happen effectively if we don't have, you know, information that's being communicated from the day-to-day activities and from the environment itself.
5979000	5985000	You know, strategy can't happen within a kind of bubble where there's no information coming into it, right?
5985000	5993000	It has to have information and that means you have to have some kind of communication, you know, effective communication systems within an organization.
5993000	6005000	So in, you know, small collectives and the kind of small workers cooperative, that might be very, very simple where the communication is just we talk to each other, you know, we tell each other what's happening.
6005000	6012000	We have a meeting every week where we go around and everyone says, okay, this is what happened this week and this went wrong.
6012000	6017000	And so the information is shared within the system, quite simply.
6017000	6031000	But if we think about sort of larger systems, we need to think about, okay, how do we create specific communication channels so that the right information is going to the right places?
6032000	6036000	So the right information is collected, but also presented in the most effective ways.
6036000	6046000	And also, you know, an important part for cybernetics is how do we sort of manage the amount of information?
6046000	6050000	So we don't want to be flooded with too much. We need to kind of filter some stuff out.
6050000	6059000	We need to dampen down some of that massive variety of information so that we can actually use it in effective and practical ways.
6059000	6068000	But developing communication systems so that information can be taken and travel around the organization to the places it's needed.
6068000	6072000	People can make decisions based on the right information.
6072000	6075000	That's incredibly important. And that's all communication.
6075000	6080000	Some of it's talking, some of it will be different, different forms of communicating information.
6081000	6091000	And I think related to that, and this is also I think important in order to highlight that cybernetics itself also is not innocent.
6091000	6096000	It kind of formats things in specific ways.
6096000	6107000	It makes you look at processes in specific ways and thereby having certain imperatives inscribed in it as well.
6107000	6111000	And some of them might be desirable, others maybe not.
6111000	6126000	So maybe just to highlight this as well, that a process of reflection upon this processes of formatting within cybernetics would be useful as well.
6126000	6137000	And one of the things or one of the ways that you do reflect upon this is when it comes to the specific way that information is thought about within cybernetics,
6137000	6147000	because very much at the beginning of cybernetics, there is information theory developed by Claude Shannon,
6147000	6153000	which does a formatting when it comes to information.
6153000	6164000	And it's a specific type of formatting that has a specific idea of what is noise and what is not and what should be eliminated because it is termed noise.
6164000	6174000	So it kind of introduces an idea of what is to be used and what is to be left aside and to be eliminated.
6174000	6186000	And you take this example of noise in order to point out that actually, no, the way in which cybernetics looks at this question of noise is actually problematic
6186000	6194000	because it eliminates aspects of the existing world, so to speak, or the surroundings that we live in.
6194000	6208000	It eliminates aspects of these surroundings that are actually very much useful and fruitful and should be taken into account when it comes to the way that we approach, in this case, anarchist cybernetics.
6208000	6223000	And for this, you look at different ways that noise can be framed and you develop an idea of a form of noise that actually should be part of the way that we approach anarchist cybernetics.
6223000	6231000	And this is called pink noise. So could you maybe elaborate on what we have to imagine if we think about pink noise?
6231000	6240000	Yes, this is actually based on some work that some people who are involved in the Indignados movement in Spain developed.
6240000	6250000	So this was looking at the social media activity that was related to that movement.
6250000	6262000	And what they were able to do was suggest in very broad terms that there's essentially three different types of noise in these social media communication systems.
6262000	6270000	So if you imagine in terms of what I've just said about communication and information, social media is one of the ways that we share information.
6270000	6282000	But if we were to go on Facebook or Twitter, it's impossible for us to see and grasp everything that everybody is sharing.
6282000	6286000	There's just far too much, far too high quantity of information there.
6286000	6294000	Even just if we've got Facebook with our close friends, there's still a huge amount that people could be sharing there.
6294000	6300000	And it's very difficult for us to actually see and process all of that in a kind of effective way.
6300000	6310000	And so what these data scientists and activists were able to do was look at the sort of, and I think it was just focused on Twitter,
6310000	6323000	that kind of social media information ecosystem in a sense, and see well there's different outcomes from the information being shared.
6323000	6331000	And that very much depends on the way that noise is handled within these systems.
6331000	6338000	So let's say there's the sort of two extremes here. There's the kind of white noise, which is just incredibly chaotic.
6338000	6344000	So there's no real, so the person looking at information isn't really able to see any kind of pattern at all.
6344000	6348000	It just looks like random sort of snapshots of information.
6349000	6356000	If you imagine this as different tweets, maybe you're not really able to see, okay, I can't really see an actual thread emerging here.
6356000	6359000	I can't see an actual narrative emerging from this.
6359000	6368000	It looks like it's just thousands of people spewing out lots of different opinions and thoughts and experiences and everything.
6368000	6376000	And I can't, I don't have an overall picture of this is what's actually happening within this kind of social movement.
6377000	6384000	And they say, well, that kind of very chaotic white noise, that doesn't really allow you to organize in any kind of effective way.
6384000	6394000	The kind of organization that goes along with that is going to be very sporadic, very, very spontaneous, very chaotic, not coordinated in any kind of way.
6394000	6397000	So it's not really any kind of actual self-organization.
6397000	6403000	It's just lots of people responding and reacting and running about chaotically.
6403000	6414000	At the other extreme of that, they say, well, you can have a communication system where things are highly regulated and highly organized.
6414000	6432000	So you maybe have some kind of, whether it's actually a sort of central control agency that's deciding to filter the information in a very, very specific way so that you only see a very, very narrow subset of the information.
6432000	6451000	That might be, I don't know, if the communication ecosystem was controlled by a political party or something, they might say, well, we've got our goals as a political party and we're only going to give you information that we think is going to be beneficial to that.
6451000	6469000	So that creates a form of organization, but creates an incredibly rigid form of organization where if everyone's only seeing one narrative from the information, then that only gives them the resources to act in a very, very narrow range of ways.
6469000	6479000	So they can only really act in very specific ways, which for something like a political party is quite useful because they kind of want people to be doing very specific actions.
6479000	6483000	They don't want people to be doing their own thing in different ways.
6483000	6488000	They want people to be very, very, very coordinated, highly coordinated and controlled.
6488000	6496000	If you imagine a political party during an election cycle, they want people to be putting out the same message because that's what happened.
6496000	6498000	The party needs to be happening at that moment.
6498000	6504000	They need everyone to be on message, everyone to be responsible in very specific ways.
6505000	6517000	But then from a cybernetics perspective, that kind of very rigid organization, everything we've kind of discussed so far today, that's not a very effective mode of organization.
6517000	6526000	It might be able to hold together for a very short period of time, but ultimately it's too rigid to be able to respond to any kind of change effectively.
6526000	6541000	So ultimately it's going to either maintain itself through very direct control of the people involved or it's going to break down because it can't respond to a changing environment.
6541000	6555000	And so a very sort of narrow control of information, these people sort of suggest, produces or is more beneficial to that very, very rigid form of organization.
6555000	6562000	So you have these two extremes, the white noise, which is very chaotic, very sporadic, no sort of coherent narrative.
6562000	6571000	And if people have that information, that's going to lead to very spontaneous, very chaotic action, not coordinated action.
6571000	6577000	On the other extreme, you have very, very controlled, very rigid narrative in terms of information.
6577000	6585000	And that's the kind of brown noise. So very kind of solid, coherent noise.
6585000	6599000	But it's one narrative, it's one sort of channel of control in a sense, and that either produces or reinforces or is beneficial for very rigid, very top down, very controlled forms of organization.
6599000	6603000	In between these, you have something called pink noise.
6603000	6606000	And that's where you have a sort of balance between these two.
6606000	6612000	It's not dominated by one specific narratives, the information isn't filtered.
6612000	6620000	So there's only one narrative coming through, but it's not as chaotic as the white noise.
6620000	6628000	So what you have in the information is you might have a series of narratives that are a bit more autonomous and a bit more self generating.
6628000	6631000	But there is a sort of coherent set of narratives.
6631000	6637000	So you as a person looking at this information can see, OK, I can see what's happening here.
6637000	6642000	It's not so chaotic that I don't have any idea, but I'm also not only getting one narrative.
6642000	6648000	I'm seeing different things and I'm able to, through seeing these different things, understand what's happening.
6648000	6652000	I can actually use this information effectively.
6652000	6658000	And so these people who are involved in the Indignados process are able that kind of noise in a system.
6658000	6663000	We have some kind of coordination, but it's not super rigid.
6663000	6671000	That produces or reinforces the kind of self organization that we've been talking about today.
6671000	6678000	Because people are able to see from the information, OK, I can see that this is useful, this narrative is useful.
6678000	6680000	We can use that or that's relevant to us.
6680000	6684000	We can draw on that and that allows us to organize.
6684000	6691000	And I think that's really important because it's very, very speculative and it's very vague.
6691000	6701000	It's not, you know, prescribing a specific way that information channels can be organized or that systems should be designed.
6701000	6702000	It's very, very vague.
6702000	6711000	But it is saying there is a relationship between how information is organized and filtered
6711000	6720000	and how that information can be practically used or developed on or built on.
6720000	6726000	So if we have information that's in the form of a kind of pink noise, where there's some sort of differentiation,
6726000	6739000	some variety, some sort of diversity in the information, but we can still pick out coherent narratives or coherent stories coming through from the information.
6739000	6741000	Then we can act on it in constructive ways.
6741000	6747000	We have the resources from that information to be able to self organize.
6747000	6757000	While you're talking, I'm kind of trying to figure out whether or not people might actually be able to understand what you're talking about,
6757000	6766000	because if I'm not mistaken, the way in which you use the term information is already a very specific one.
6766000	6773000	You have a high degree of information if the signal is actually not that clear,
6773000	6782000	if there's a lot going on beyond the actual content of the signal, so to speak.
6782000	6784000	So that's high information.
6784000	6794000	And this is something that you now, based on these researchers, try to inspect a bit more closely
6794000	6801000	and try to take a look at whether or not there might be something useful in it and actually stating yes, there might be.
6801000	6810000	If it's not too chaotic or too stable, but presents itself in a way that is already again maybe formatted
6810000	6815000	or presents itself in a way that strikes a balance between the two,
6815000	6822000	then it should be incorporated into the organization of the structure,
6822000	6828000	additional to what would be termed in the classical information theory, the signal.
6828000	6833000	So I think this is something we need to kind of point out towards the audience,
6833000	6840000	because it already operates on the level where this idea of information theory and what is signal and what is noise
6840000	6845000	and what should be rejected and whatnot is taken for granted.
6845000	6848000	And I believe that most of the people are not familiar with that.
6848000	6853000	But maybe you could correct me if I'm wrong. Did I get that right?
6853000	6856000	Yeah, it's incredibly, incredibly difficult, I think.
6856000	6861000	And it's something I'm not 100% convinced I've got my head around,
6861000	6869000	because when we think of information, we think about the content that's communicated.
6869000	6874000	So if I give you information, I'm telling you something and there's a certain content there.
6874000	6880000	And in some of this early information theory, that wasn't what they were talking about.
6880000	6885000	And that makes it really, really difficult to work out when some of these authors
6885000	6890000	and people like Stafford Beer, who were to some degree building on their work,
6890000	6897000	are talking about information, it's difficult to often say, OK, what exactly are they talking about here?
6897000	6905000	I think the sort of most useful way of thinking about it is thinking about what this means in practice for us
6905000	6907000	and what noise means in practice.
6907000	6915000	So as you said, noise in a communication system is normally the thing that we want to eliminate.
6915000	6922000	So if you imagine that it doesn't happen now, but in the past, when you turn the TV on,
6922000	6930000	there might be a certain amount of static, that sort of fuzzy, white, staticky noise and the image that went with it.
6931000	6938000	And you would try and, going back quite a while, you would try and adjust your TV aerial
6938000	6944000	so that the picture comes through and you don't have that static, fuzzy noise.
6944000	6950000	So you're trying to eliminate the noise. You're trying to say, well, we want the signal and we don't want the noise.
6950000	6954000	And obviously that's great for TV, right? Because we need that.
6954000	6959000	Because we wanted to see the signal, we wanted to watch the TV program at that moment.
6959000	6964000	Or on radio, it still works in exactly the same way.
6964000	6971000	But I think what a more critical look at noise and information allows us to do is say,
6971000	6975000	there's always a kind of built-in logic to doing that.
6975000	6981000	So it's fine if we're trying to find a particular TV station or a particular radio station.
6982000	6985000	And we want that specific and we know what it is we want.
6985000	6991000	We can filter out the noise, we can adjust the dial or the aerial, and we'll get the signal that we know we want.
6991000	6995000	But often in terms of communication information, that's not the case.
6995000	6998000	We don't know what it is we're looking for. We're trying to learn something new.
6998000	7001000	Someone trying to tell us something that we don't know what it is already.
7001000	7008000	So when it's actually people sharing information, we need to be much more careful about what we're eliminating.
7008000	7016000	So if we're thinking about social media, OK, the noise doesn't look like, you know, white, fuzzy, static.
7016000	7022000	The noise instead looks like, well, I've got a timeline of tweets that I'm scrolling through
7022000	7028000	and I can't work out what's important, what I need to focus on, what I need to put my attention on,
7028000	7036000	and what is just kind of, you know, useless advertising or stuff that doesn't interest me.
7036000	7041000	And it's very difficult to tell. So when we're scrolling through, it's very difficult for us to work out.
7041000	7048000	This is something I need to be looking at, and this is something that has no relevance to me,
7048000	7054000	isn't relevant to what I'm interested in or what I'm wanting to do in the world.
7054000	7061000	I think one thing we have to be careful with noise in is thinking about, OK, are we filtering out things
7061000	7066000	that just don't make sense to us, but which could actually be really important for us?
7066000	7071000	You know, so we have to kind of be aware of, like, you know, we don't want to end up in the echo chamber
7071000	7077000	where we're filtering out things that, oh, well, I don't really agree with that, but I'll filter it out.
7077000	7082000	And then I'm actually missing a huge part of the picture of what's happening in the world.
7082000	7088000	But the other really big danger is that how things like Facebook and Twitter
7088000	7097000	and other similar platforms operate is they are already filtering out a lot of what they think of as noise.
7097000	7104000	And that's incredibly political. It's like anyone who scrolls through their Facebook feed now will see,
7104000	7109000	OK, there's a lot of adverts, right? There's much more than there was 10 years ago.
7110000	7120000	Now it's like every two or three items on a news feed is a sponsored advert for something.
7120000	7123000	And we haven't always decided that we want to see that, right?
7123000	7130000	The algorithm that Facebook has and the fact that there are companies who pay money for that advertising,
7130000	7135000	that's what decides what filters through the noise, right?
7135000	7143000	So things that we might find really important are filtered out by these corporations, essentially,
7143000	7150000	in order for us to see what they think is important, what they want us to see, the advertising, for example.
7150000	7155000	And a lot of political content is being filtered out in this way.
7155000	7162000	So a lot of stuff that is very relevant to the political and economic situation we find ourselves in
7162000	7170000	and to learning about that and to trying to change that is being filtered out by these systems in favor of
7170000	7176000	sponsored adverts, spam, celebrity gossip, things like this.
7176000	7183000	So thinking about that sort of information and noise stuff, I think the technical side is really interesting
7183000	7189000	because it's fun to try and get our heads around how people were using these terms and what they were meaning
7189000	7193000	and why that was important for what came afterwards.
7193000	7197000	But really, the interesting thing is, well, what does this mean in practice?
7197000	7204000	And if we're talking about how do we filter noise in a communication system,
7204000	7211000	given that for us, the main communication system now is social media still.
7211000	7218000	The fact that there's corporations like Facebook and Twitter and then all the companies that are paying to advertise,
7218000	7223000	that sort of corporate process is what's doing the filtering.
7223000	7227000	It's not something we have any control over at all.
7227000	7232000	So we might need to have some filtering, so it might just be too much.
7232000	7237000	We can only look at a certain amount of stuff and actually process it mentally.
7237000	7241000	So we need to do some kind of filtering. That's fine.
7241000	7243000	But it needs to be something we have control over.
7243000	7248000	So there needs to be some kind of, and again, this is incredibly speculative,
7248000	7253000	there needs to be some kind of way that the algorithms that are doing the filtering
7253000	7258000	are somehow subject to some kind of democratic control.
7258000	7263000	So that even though we know what we're getting is filtered,
7263000	7267000	the noise that's filtered out is something we've at least agreed to.
7268000	7274000	We've at least said, yeah, I've had some democratic say in how the algorithm operates.
7274000	7276000	I know why it works.
7276000	7282000	It works in a way that we think is politically and ethically beneficial.
7282000	7285000	So the filtering is fine.
7285000	7291000	It's like an email spam folder, which actually filters out the spam.
7291000	7293000	That's fantastic, right?
7293000	7296000	Because it allows us to only see the emails that are important.
7296000	7300000	So we need to have something like that, I think, for these kinds of social media platforms.
7300000	7302000	Absolutely, we do.
7302000	7309000	So the decision over what is seen as noise and what is not is absolutely political.
7309000	7311000	I would definitely agree.
7311000	7316000	And maybe this would lead us into a different terrain.
7316000	7322000	Maybe I would add that even before that,
7322000	7329000	one would have to think about the things that are not information and not communication
7329000	7335000	and provide ways in which they can be included in the processes
7335000	7338000	that we use as organizational processes as well.
7338000	7344000	Because if you only consider communication and information,
7344000	7348000	this is already a form of filtering as well, I would say.
7348000	7353000	But this is a different topic, I would say.
7353000	7359000	In order to enable the kinds of communication anarchist cybernetics relies on,
7359000	7364000	you stress the need, and this was implicit in your answer right now already,
7364000	7368000	you stress the need for alternative social media platforms.
7368000	7370000	So maybe you could give us a sketch.
7370000	7376000	What could they look like and what are the functional elements that they should provide?
7376000	7384000	So I think the question of what kind of communication systems are functionally useful
7384000	7387000	for the kind of self-organization we've been talking about,
7387000	7393000	it's both really, really important but also incredibly difficult to start to do, I think.
7393000	7397000	So when I started looking at this topic,
7397000	7402000	and this was in 2011 around the Occupy movement and things,
7402000	7408000	and at that point still, there was a lot of hope in social media.
7408000	7412000	So still at that point, there was a lot of criticism of it,
7412000	7416000	but it was still a sort of idea that things like Facebook and Twitter
7416000	7420000	can be productive for a kind of radical politics.
7420000	7423000	I don't think anyone believes that now, I think.
7423000	7428000	Now we're really in the sort of dystopian nightmare scenario
7428000	7436000	of how these platforms have developed and the ways they produce mental health crises
7436000	7452000	and conflict and political outcomes is much bleaker now than it was 10 years ago,
7452000	7456000	although I think a lot of that was probably even on the horizon then.
7456000	7465000	So I think it's quite difficult to imagine what kind of platforms would be better than them,
7465000	7470000	what kind of platforms would work that would fulfill some of the same functions
7470000	7477000	but do so in a way that is much more conducive to a kind of radical anarchist politics
7477000	7483000	and the kind of self-organization that's involved in anarchist cybernetics.
7483000	7490000	I think I also have to preface these kind of discussions with saying that I'm not a platform developer,
7490000	7495000	I'm not an app designer, I don't know anything about computer coding or design or anything like that.
7495000	7504000	So it's my sort of perspective on it is very much for the kind of political and organizational functions
7504000	7510000	that these kind of communication systems would need to have.
7511000	7514000	I think there's a lot of different ones in terms of thinking about,
7514000	7522000	well, what does self-organization look like in practice for anarchist collectives and social movements
7522000	7531000	and also at a larger scale of things like participatory and democratic constitution making.
7531000	7533000	What do those things look like?
7533000	7539000	And then how could a platform help facilitate some of that?
7539000	7544000	Because I think that's something that comes through in Stafford Beer's work a lot.
7544000	7550000	So when he was writing as far back as the 1950s when computers were still in their infancy,
7550000	7560000	but even then he was clear in saying, well, the way computing is developing is it's not developing
7560000	7569000	in the direction whereby it's going to be helping us do the sort of basic functions of a human society.
7569000	7581000	It's helping us make work more efficient maybe or helping us produce more and do more in terms of our working lives.
7581000	7588000	But it's not necessarily actually helping us communicate as a society or share ideas or share knowledge or things like that.
7588000	7597000	So I think that's the important thing is what sort of perspective or starting point are we coming from with thinking about technology?
7597000	7602000	And it has to be how does it help us do things like self-organization?
7604000	7610000	That said, it's still incredibly difficult to work out exactly what that would look like.
7611000	7621000	And I think the reason for that is there's quite a strong disconnect between platforms that have been developed,
7621000	7631000	that are very, very successful at the sort of more practical or functional side of self-organization.
7631000	7639000	So we have things like Lumio, for example, which is developed by Workers' Cooperative.
7639000	7651000	It's designed specifically to help cooperatives and sort of movements and communities that are organized in cooperative and democratic ways to help them function.
7651000	7655000	And it does that very well in terms of the sort of technical and functional aspects.
7655000	7658000	It's a fantastic platform.
7658000	7666000	But what it doesn't have is the kind of social aspect that something like Facebook or Twitter still has.
7666000	7679000	So there's a reason that a lot of the alternative social media platforms are things that have branded themselves as alternative social media platforms
7679000	7686000	that have been focused on activists in some way or focused on activist organizing.
7686000	7695000	I think there's a reason that not many of them have actually been successful because they haven't effectively mirrored this sort of social dynamic.
7695000	7705000	So one of the things that I think is incredibly important and also one of the sort of dangers of something like Facebook or Twitter.
7705000	7713000	I feel like I'm already very sort of old school with this, talking just about Facebook and Twitter,
7713000	7719000	because I know there's like a host of new platforms like Twitch and stuff that people use in TikTok.
7719000	7723000	That's just sort of outside of my sort of wheelhouse.
7723000	7729000	I think I'm feeling very old when I talk about social media now even, which didn't feel that way 10 years ago.
7729000	7736000	But yeah, if we look at these sorts of platforms, the reason they're successful is people socialize on them.
7736000	7741000	People spend time with their friends on them. People make friends on these platforms.
7741000	7745000	They're not just communicating in very functional ways.
7746000	7753000	Something that we think is incredibly important is people are wasting time on these platforms, which is what you do with friends, right?
7753000	7759000	When you get together with your friends, you don't say, right, we're going to organize something here.
7759000	7764000	We're going to do some detailed, very efficient organizing.
7764000	7770000	You might do that, but most of the time when you get together with your friends, you're having stupid conversations.
7770000	7776000	You're telling stupid jokes. You're just not really doing anything, just wasting time together.
7776000	7781000	I think that's actually incredibly important for how we build relationships.
7781000	7787000	It's like you're getting together to not really do anything, to just sort of be together.
7787000	7792000	I think things like Facebook and Twitter work great for that, and they exploit that, right?
7792000	7799000	Because you then become addicted to it and you get drawn in and they channel that activity in very specific ways.
7799000	7804000	But that's the real challenge, I think, for some kind of alternative platform.
7804000	7815000	It can do all the functional stuff for self-organization very, very well, but it's still not the kind of place that people want to actually hang out and spend time.
7815000	7819000	Or it's much more difficult to use those platforms in that way.
7819000	7839000	I think that's the big challenge is, well, A, how do we sort of mirror some of that to get people away from these sort of mainstream corporate platforms that are channeling information in specific ways and producing behavior in very specific ways?
7839000	7844000	How do we get them away from that, but still keep that social aspect?
7844000	7852000	Because people aren't going to just give up because I think people who give up on social media are fantastic.
7852000	7857000	I think these are brilliant people and they should be lauded for their ability to do that.
7857000	7866000	But for most of us, that would mean no longer having contact with a huge number of our friends because I've got friends all around the world.
7866000	7876000	And if I wasn't seeing them post memes and jokes on Facebook, I'd probably never have contact with these people anymore.
7876000	7878000	I think that'd be really sad.
7878000	7881000	So it is like, how do we mirror the social aspect?
7881000	7895000	How do we make these platforms things that people want to spend time on, but also that people don't become addicted to, that people are able to say, OK, I can do this online and it's fun and it gets me some great contact.
7895000	7902000	I have some great friendships that can build relationships, but I'm still doing stuff outside of that.
7902000	7906000	That's not my entire life because that in itself is very, very damaging.
7906000	7913000	That's sort of been being solely locked in on a kind of digital platform or that sort of mode of communication.
7913000	7922000	So I think that's the real challenge in terms of less about the sort of specifics of the architecture now and more about
7922000	7934000	how do we have something that fulfills that social function and that does that in a way that doesn't exploit us or doesn't take advantage of the fact that we need that social content.
7934000	7943000	And when it comes to the coordination part of things, I mean, this would be an interesting aspect as well of a potential platform.
7943000	7951000	You are right now very much focusing on like a functional equivalent to classical social media, so to speak.
7951000	7970000	But I mean, it would be very interesting to provide platforms that are able to facilitate these processes that are actually important for anarchist cybernetics in terms of coordination, in terms of decision making,
7970000	7987000	for example, helping with these questions of grant strategy, with coordinating different activities on different levels, all of the stuff that will be an essential part of effective self-organization, so to speak.
7987000	8000000	And I think this would be an area where alternative platforms will be of help and need to be of help as well if we consider the question of scalability that we talked about before.
8000000	8007000	Yeah, definitely. And I think that's where we have seen the most sort of promise in terms of alternatives.
8007000	8025000	I mean, I think that the difficulty is that although a lot of this sort of development work, developing web platforms, it feels very accessible and very democratic because all you need is a computer and you just need the time to do it and to learn some of the coding and things.
8025000	8035000	Actually, the platforms that work well and that are effective and successful cost a huge amount of money to develop.
8035000	8050000	So even something like Lumio, which is probably the most successful in terms of something that's designed specifically to support cooperative type ways of organizing, it was still relatively small budget compared to a big social media platform,
8051000	8062000	but it was still quite a lot of money and time went into it. So there's still that big barrier to, I think, fully experimenting with different platforms.
8062000	8069000	So even though it feels like, well, we can just try different things out, there's a lot of barriers to actually doing that.
8070000	8082000	But I think that's where there's the most sort of promise, as I said, I think it is, I mean, Lumio is the success story here because it is, the functionality is fantastic.
8082000	8097000	It works really, really well. What I think is really important is it integrates with other platforms, which is really important because I think the way I sort of characterize it in the book is a bit too much focusing on,
8097000	8110000	can we create one platform that can do everything? And I think that the sort of reality now is, well, can we actually have a handful of platforms that integrate together?
8110000	8120000	So you're not having to have, for example, you know, Lumio, which is essentially a kind of forum type sort of format where you have different threads within a forum and different subgroups.
8121000	8130000	People can be members of different groups, which is really important. It also allows for decision making. So it has different models of decision making built into it.
8130000	8140000	So people can make proposals within a thread and, you know, they can be subject to consensus or majority or whatever.
8140000	8147000	But there's different democratic mechanisms within Lumio for actually making decisions as well as just having discussions.
8147000	8160000	But, you know, if we were thinking about, well, how can that be the sort of complete package? We would say, well, you know, given so much of the work that we're doing now is online or distance or working from home.
8160000	8166000	Does Lumio then need to have a kind of video conferencing functionality built in?
8166000	8183000	I think that's where it would get incredibly difficult to develop a single platform that actually has all of that functionality because it would maybe be a very, very, very, you know, server intensive platform, which would cost a lot to run, cost a lot to develop.
8183000	8197000	So is it better to think, OK, we can have other platforms like Jitsi, for example, which is, you know, kind of open source video conferencing platform.
8197000	8206000	You have things like Framapad, which is a kind of, you know, again, open source version of Google Docs, something like that.
8206000	8217000	Can we just integrate these platforms together better so that we're not having to constantly be going, OK, well, we'll use this platform for this and this one for this.
8217000	8222000	And then we've got really important information in two different places.
8222000	8226000	Can we just have these integrated somehow rather than being the one platform?
8226000	8237000	But how do we just create that kind of synchronization so that we can maybe work primarily within Lumio, but then go to a different platform for the video conferencing?
8237000	8245000	But we're still accessing it through Lumio somehow without having to completely go out of that ecosystem.
8245000	8256000	So I think that's where is the most sort of practical potential is sort of how do we network between different platforms to provide all these functions.
8256000	8267000	So things like, you know, having discussions that are, you know, productive and effective and moderated in fair ways, that everyone has a chance to speak,
8267000	8281000	but that we can also make effective democratic decisions that everyone feels they've had a genuine chance to take part in, where we can, you know, store documents for agreements that we've made, that we can quickly see, OK, this is who agreed to what.
8281000	8283000	These are the agreements that we made as a group.
8283000	8288000	We can quickly check back on things where we can where we can.
8288000	8295000	One of the core functions of the viable system model is being able to monitor what's happening in the organization.
8295000	8300000	How do we build that into, you know, is that already in Lumio?
8300000	8302000	Do we have that functionality there?
8302000	8304000	Do we need to maybe build on that?
8304000	8318000	Do we need to bring something else in that can where we can have that monitoring and be able to easily see it where it's transparent and people don't feel that it's that they're just being monitored by a kind of algorithm or something.
8318000	8322000	So I think that's those are the kind of difficult questions at the moment.
8322000	8327000	Yeah, and I would definitely agree that it needs to be a combination of different approaches.
8327000	8333000	So I think in some situations, there might be already existing alternative like Jitsi.
8333000	8335000	I think this is a very good example.
8335000	8349000	OK, we do not need to invent another open source video conferencing platform, but it would make sense to integrate it in in the platform that tries to provide it all as a user experience,
8349000	8361000	because this I think is pretty much important that it would be very helpful if we had one platform that is able to provide these different services in an open source kind of way.
8361000	8367000	Plus X plus additional services that do not yet exist in an open source fashion.
8367000	8373000	So I'm not sure if we did this already sufficiently.
8373000	8374000	It's difficult to say.
8374000	8378000	Actually, we have this example of the movement of the squares.
8378000	8383000	You also gave an example when it comes to a cooperatively run cafe.
8383000	8393000	But still, I think there is a layer, a level when it comes to anarchist cybernetics that we kind of touched upon, but did not yet spell out in full.
8393000	8396000	I mean, this probably will not be possible.
8396000	8405000	But still, I would be interested if if we take a look at the level of society as a whole, where could we go from here?
8405000	8425000	If we if we consider these insights of cybernetic of anarchist cybernetics and if we try to extrapolate these insights into a future that that is also on a society wide level organized along these principles of anarchist cybernetics.
8425000	8427000	So how would that look like?
8427000	8434000	And how how would a process that that tries to make use of these insights look like?
8434000	8446000	How could this brought into existence in order to get to a point at which to quote Allende, at last, the people are in control?
8446000	8457000	So I think one of the most interesting sort of examples along these lines is the mutual aid networks that grew up during during the covid pandemic.
8457000	8467000	So obviously these these were, you know, depending on where these happened and who was involved, they were more or less radical in different ways.
8467000	8476000	But this was a moment which I think anyone obviously no one anticipated that some people did anticipate the pandemic and they weren't listened to.
8476000	8479000	But, you know, nobody really expected it to happen.
8479000	8490000	But also, I think no anarchists expected the sort of term mutual aid, which is something that comes from Peter Kropotkin's work, which is a really, really strong part of the anarchist tradition.
8490000	8502000	For that word to suddenly have this massive, massive global currency and loads of people using it and thousands upon thousands of groups around the world and using using this term.
8502000	8507000	So that was really, really interesting that that sort of happened and nobody expected it.
8507000	8524000	But it is the kind of thing, I mean, that, as I sort of said said earlier, you know, when these anarchists like Kropotkin were describing the kind of societies that they wanted to build, they weren't just imagining these.
8524000	8529000	They were saying, well, this is how things have worked in the past, or we can see examples of it already happening.
8529000	8533000	We should do more of this and mutual aid is one of those examples.
8533000	8536000	So, you know, Kropotkin says, well, mutual aid is happening all the time.
8536000	8547000	We're constantly helping each other in a kind of mutual way without the need for payment, without the need for sort of any kind of direct compensation.
8547000	8549000	We just help each other collectively.
8549000	8555000	That's a normal thing that, you know, humans do, other animal species do, plants do.
8555000	8566000	So I think how those mutual aid groups developed is really, really important because these were by and large very autonomously organized.
8566000	8579000	So there wasn't, I mean, one of the failures of government was that there wasn't any kind of coordination for those first few weeks of lockdowns in a lot of countries, definitely in the UK.
8579000	8581000	There wasn't any central coordination.
8581000	8590000	It took a long time for government to actually think about how they need to be supporting people during something like, you know, lockdown.
8590000	8604000	And so these mutual aid groups emerged, you know, semi-spontaneously a lot of the time with people who already had experience or already had worked together in similar things to try and make sure people's basic needs were provided for.
8604000	8617000	So ensure people had food if they weren't able to leave the house, ensure that people had social contact, you know, guaranteeing that people could get medication that they needed if they weren't able to go to the pharmacy.
8617000	8633000	So a lot of these kind of, you know, basic functions were being provided by groups of volunteers, you know, people getting together without any central coordination quite autonomously, you know, often making decisions in very democratic ways.
8633000	8638000	You know, networking horizontally with other groups nearby.
8638000	8640000	So it was really interesting to see how this happened.
8640000	8656000	And I think that's the kind of thing that is the most concrete of thinking about what could this, you know, anarchist cybernetic stuff, what could this look like at a kind of larger scale in the most immediate term.
8657000	8662000	And I think it's building on those kind of mutual aid networks.
8662000	8669000	Now a lot of them ended up, you know, falling apart when they were no longer directly needed.
8669000	8675000	A lot of the time governments came in and started to take on coordinating roles.
8675000	8684000	A lot of people in the sort of NGOs and charities started to sort of take more leadership type coordinating positions.
8684000	8689000	So the mutual aid groups often weren't radical to begin with.
8689000	8704000	But it was definitely a sort of process of de-radicalization, moving away from something that could be seen as this is potentially an alternative way we can start organizing society, start looking out for each other collectively.
8704000	8713000	Definitely moved away from that. But there's still that sort of germ there of, well, we did that, you know, two years ago at the start of these lockdowns.
8713000	8722000	So there clearly is that potential in societies to build these kind of autonomous self-help communities.
8722000	8729000	And cybernetics is, I think, really essential to working out how they can be at their most effective.
8730000	8754000	So the kind of things I was describing with the viable systems model and John Walker's work in particular for thinking about how something like a cooperative or like an anarchist type collective could use the viable systems model to help them design their own processes and design their ways of organizing and ways of working.
8754000	8763000	Mutual aid groups could be doing that kind of thing so that they can actually be more conscious and more aware of this is how we are at our most effective.
8763000	8774000	This is how we need to be organizing to be doing what we want to do, to be providing the kind of support that we want to be providing for each other.
8774000	8780000	And I think that has the potential to say, OK, we can do it in this, you know, small aspect of our lives.
8780000	8785000	Can we just start organizing public services in this way?
8785000	8793000	Can we start, you know, we managed during COVID to ensure that everyone had access to medication.
8793000	8801000	Well, can we maybe just organize that kind of logistics network for distributing essentials like medication?
8801000	8806000	Can we organize that in a democratic and non-hierarchical way?
8806000	8810000	You know, we did it during COVID. Maybe we can do that more generally.
8810000	8820000	So maybe those mutual aid networks give us the sort of framework to start thinking about this is how we could be reorganizing society in different ways.
8821000	8824000	Again, the question is how much of that?
8824000	8842000	It remains to be seen what the legacy of those mutual aid networks is going to be, because it's still very fresh and we're still in the very unusual circumstances of coming out of the pandemic or potentially still going into just the next phase of the pandemic.
8843000	8845000	But I think that's potentially in the long term.
8845000	8848000	What's the legacy of the mutual aid?
8848000	8857000	Can that be something we build on to think about how we coordinate the various functions of the lives that we have together?
8857000	8866000	And there's a last question that I ask all of my guests, and that is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
8866000	8875000	I think that's a fantastic question, and it's one that I'm going to be very, very bleak on and say nothing.
8875000	8883000	I think at the moment we're in, it's hard to see much hope.
8883000	8895000	So even though I was talking about mutual aid and there's potentially the possibility of expanding that to how we reimagine society and reimagine the way we live and work together.
8895000	8901000	Having the hope that that's going to happen is a very different question, I think.
8901000	8910000	I mean, just the situation we're in as we're recording this, you know, where the UK is facing 40 degree temperatures for the first time.
8910000	8917000	There's, you know, big parts of the world of having up to 50 degree temperatures that have never had that before, really.
8917000	8931000	It's just terrifying how bleak the future is and whether there's the potential of stopping that kind of, you know, dramatic and catastrophic climate change,
8931000	8944000	or whether we're at the stage now of we need to try and minimize it maybe and somehow come through the other side in some way as effective working societies.
8944000	8948000	Whether that'll happen, I'm really not sure and not very hopeful, sadly.
8948000	8953000	And also, you know, what we're talking about in terms of the digital platforms and technologies.
8953000	8960000	I mean, the temperatures that we're seeing around the world now, you know, electrical circuits start melting, technology stops working.
8960000	8967000	So is this slightly a kind of fantasy we're indulging in?
8968000	8976000	Yeah, I apologize. That's incredibly bleak note to end on, but it's where I sort of feel at the moment, I think, sadly.
8976000	8983000	No need to apologize. Everybody can answer whatever he, she or they might with this question.
8983000	8987000	So this is absolutely super interesting to me to hear as well.
8987000	8995000	And I have to add, you're not the first one to not being positive about this question.
8995000	8999000	So this is absolutely a valid answer as well.
8999000	9008000	Yeah, I think, I mean, one thing that is, I think, a sort of change in my lifetime that seems to be just going in the right direction, I think,
9008000	9020000	is if I see how much more adept people are now thinking through things like gender and sexuality.
9021000	9030000	I mean, that's just incredible. If I think back to the experiences that I saw when I was in school and how, you know,
9030000	9036000	homophobic it was and then hearing from friends who are teachers,
9036000	9041000	knowing about how young people nowadays are dealing with things like gender and sexuality.
9042000	9048000	I mean, that gives me a lot of hope. That's incredibly encouraging to just see those dramatic,
9048000	9053000	dramatic advances in such a short space of time.
9053000	9056000	So that's one thing to be hopeful about, perhaps.

9069000	9071000	I really, really enjoyed discussing that.
