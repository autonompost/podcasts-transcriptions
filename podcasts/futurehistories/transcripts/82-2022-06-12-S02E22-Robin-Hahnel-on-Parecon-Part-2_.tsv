0	11000	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and what you're about to hear today is the second part of my conversation with Robin Annal on Paracon, Participatory Economics.
11000	22000	Today we are going to talk about some of the elements that have been introduced quite recently, actually in the 2021 book called Democratic Economic Planning.
22000	28000	And these are, for example, investment planning, environmental and educational planning.
28000	32000	We will also talk about some of the critical aspects of Paracon.
32000	43000	Personally, I am not a big fan of the effort rating committees, for example, and I really enjoyed covering these aspects as well, those that I feel more skeptic towards.
43000	48000	And I highly appreciate that Robin is quite open when it comes to these aspects as well.
48000	53000	So we cover a lot of ground in this second part of the conversation.
53000	62000	The chapter on reproductive labor in the recent book Democratic Economic Planning has been co-authored by Savina Choudhury.
62000	65000	And I would like to feature her on Future Histories as well.
65000	77000	This is why the topic of reproductive labor is not featured in today's episode with Robin, but will hopefully be in depth when I talk to Savina.
77000	87000	Since this is still quite new, I'd like to refer you to a new feature of Future Histories, a feature specifically for the international audience.
87000	98000	We created an English episodes only RSS feed that you can subscribe to in your podcast app, as well as a newly created English version of the homepage.
98000	105000	So please find the links in the show notes and share it among your friends, your English speaking friends.
105000	112000	Thank you so much. And speaking of thanks, thank you, David and Wilfried for your kind donations.
112000	117000	And I would like to welcome Heiner as a patron of Future Histories.
117000	120000	Thank you so much for your support as well.
120000	126000	But now please enjoy today's episode with Robin Hannell on participatory economics.
126000	136000	So let's start with the more macro questions, because in the more recent work, you incorporate long term planning into the model of Paracom.
136000	145000	And this also means that before the annual participatory planning procedure, before this begins, certain decisions have already been made.
145000	152000	A participatory investment plan has determined the amount of each capital good that must be produced during the year.
153000	164000	The second one would be a long run education and environmental plan that has determined the natural resource, the resources that can be used throughout the production cycle.
164000	176000	And the third one would be, as you just mentioned, a strategic international economic plan that has determined the amounts of different goods that will be exported and imported during the year.
176000	186000	And another macro question that has to be addressed in Paracom as well would be the question of reproductive labor.
186000	196000	I imagine that it will be difficult that we already talked for a long time, so it will be difficult to address each of these sections in detail.
196000	206000	But maybe you could give us an idea of how would Paracom try to address this, the special attention that those sectors need in each of these categories?
206000	216000	Right, there's a lot to cover. And the first thing I'd like to say is that all of these issues are ones that we didn't talk about for a long, long time.
216000	226000	For, I mean, the original publications of some of the idea of a participatory economy, that was 1990.
226000	236000	And it really isn't until 2021, when democratic economic planning was published, that we tackled all these issues, at least in public.
236000	242000	I mean, it's not like we hadn't been talking about them. We hadn't gone into print with proposals.
242000	254000	And there was a reason for that. I mean, the reason for that was we thought, first, we have to sort of get straight about whether we're talking about a market socialist economy or some sort of central planning.
254000	266000	Is there really an alternative? And in that context, talking about the annual planning procedure, as well as talking about some really important things that socialist, I mean,
266000	282000	no practicing socialist economies had ever really put into practice, things like balancing for desirability, balancing for empowerment, and, of course, dealing with the age-old issue of what's a fair system of rewarding people.
282000	292000	So we had talked about all those things, and we knew that that leaves a lot of decisions, sort of a lot of important subject areas, unaddressed.
292000	302000	The reason it's important to say this before starting is everything that we're now going to talk about, I consider to be unvetted.
302000	312000	This hasn't been discussed and argued and criticized for 10, 20, 30 years the way a bunch of other things have.
312000	324000	So we've sort of had a more or less full debate out there in the literature, whereas these things, my own attitude toward them is, hey, we're just throwing these out here for the first time.
324000	336000	I haven't heard people coming up with objections yet. I don't even know how I'm going to feel once I start hearing that.
336000	348000	So in some sense, one of the implications of this is the first time we've actually put something out there is I honestly feel less secure and sure about it.
348000	354000	I can't even promise you how much I will continue to defend it 10 years from now.
354000	368000	So I wanted to say that just to begin with. There are some really important problems that you have to deal with when you're doing long-term planning over time that you don't have to deal with when you're doing the annual plan.
368000	378000	When we do the annual plan, presumably workers councils know what their technological options are.
378000	389000	They know what different technologies they currently have available to them, and presumably consumers have some idea of what their preferences are.
389000	402000	So those are given, those things we know when we set up a system to do annual planning, but who knows what preferences of people are going to be 20 years from now?
402000	410000	And who knows what technologies will become available? What new technologies will become available?
410000	420000	But if you want to make an efficient plan about anything over 10 or 20 years, you have to actually know those things.
420000	431000	So there's a whole bunch of things that that means that part of what will determine what is an efficient investment is what you're going to do.
432000	451000	So there's a whole bunch of things that that means that part of what will determine what is an efficient investment plan or education plan or environmental plan, part of what will determine whether this plan is efficient or not is
451000	462000	What sort of technological change has taken place over these will occur in the future? And if there are changes in people's preferences, what those will be like in the future?
462000	470000	Somebody is going to have to estimate those. And when you estimate those, you're going to make mistakes.
470000	478000	So these are all problems that long term planning, you know, face that annual planning does not face.
478000	489000	And then there's another problem. If we want the planning process to be democratic, we would like everybody who's going to be affected by the plan to participate.
489000	493000	Well, people who aren't born yet can't participate.
493000	506000	So you have, if you set up a democratic process for coming up with long term plans, you have to address who's going to speak for the unborn generations.
506000	522000	And so we started with this part of the reason that we delayed as long as we did, even coming up with proposals that we recognize that while the general principle that you want the decisions to be made in a participatory way,
522000	535000	you want decisions to be self managed, you want the process to be fair, you want it to be efficient, the principles are all the same, but there's extra problems.
535000	547000	And I think those are the things that are sort of important to get out there just right from the very beginning.
547000	562000	So what we proposed is a procedure for going about what we simply call investment planning.
562000	577000	When we think of investment planning, we're basically thinking of this year we could produce consumption goods, but this year we could also produce what are typically called capital goods or investment goods.
577000	583000	Well, when we produce a capital good or an investment good this year, it doesn't do anybody this year any good at all.
583000	585000	So why would you do that?
585000	595000	Because if you produce capital or investment goods next year, you'll be able to produce more goods than you could this year.
595000	608000	So investment planning is basically a decision about, and most capital goods or investment goods basically last for figure a decade.
608000	614000	So what's the time length that makes sort of sense for investment planning?
614000	618000	And the answer is sort of think in terms of a decade.
618000	624000	So if we make a new machine this year, it's probably going to either be worn out or obsolete 10 years from now.
624000	633000	That's why 10 year time period is sort of a sensible period for investment planning.
633000	637000	Education planning, that's not the case.
637000	641000	I mean, how long does it take to educate somebody?
641000	646000	Well, 18 years gets you through high school.
646000	650000	Another four and maybe two more for graduate school in some cases.
650000	656000	And then we have a whole process of sort of lifetime learning that goes on.
656000	665000	So if you're talking about education planning, used to be called manpower planning, by the way.
665000	667000	But we can't do that anymore, thank heavens.
668000	678000	But when you say education planning, when you use the word manpower planning, it was clear that you also didn't just consider the formal education system.
678000	692000	You were also considering any sort of education and training procedures that worker councils were setting up for themselves.
692000	702000	So at least the old term manpower planning, while sexist, at least focus people's attention on the fact that this is a combination of the formal education system.
702000	708000	And inside the economy itself, we have an awful lot of education and training that goes on.
708000	715000	So that's a process that's going to stretch over three or four decades, at least.
715000	723000	And when you talk about environmental planning, we need to plan 50 to 100 years out.
723000	728000	So the timeframes are quite different in these regards.
728000	732000	So we've identified that there's very different timeframes.
732000	737000	We've identified that we know what we're trying to achieve here.
737000	739000	We want the plans to be efficient.
739000	746000	We want the process for settling on the plans to be as participatory as possible and democratic.
746000	755000	And in terms of equity, in this case, we're kind of talking about generational equity.
755000	763000	So the first thing we do is make a proposal about how to incentivize the present generation.
763000	767000	We're the only people who can sit down to make a long term plan.
767000	771000	When they're sitting down to make it, it's the present generation that's going to make it.
771000	779000	How can you incentivize them to seriously take into account the interests of future generations?
779000	784000	And we propose that before you do any kind of long term planning at all,
784000	794000	that the present generation has to discuss and vote on what we call a generational equity constraint.
794000	799000	And what the generational equity constraint says is this.
799000	811000	There has to be a limit on how much aggregate consumption can differ from one year to the next.
811000	813000	Here's a dilemma.
813000	818000	Suppose we sit down and we calculate an efficient investment plan.
818000	824000	And because technical change is going to be very, very robust,
824000	835000	it turns out that the efficient investment plan means that consumption in early years is going to be much less the consumption in late years.
835000	842000	There was an example of a country that actually did do a very unfair investment plan.
842000	852000	Stalin's Soviet Union invested such a high percentage during the 1930s and the 1940s
852000	857000	that they literally starved many people in early generations.
857000	863000	Now, you can argue with hindsight that given World War II and Hitler's onslaught,
863000	868000	maybe it's a good thing for human civilization that they did that.
868000	874000	Because it was really the Soviet Union that broke the back of the Nazism.
874000	883000	And had they not been investing 35 percent of GDP during the 1930s,
883000	887000	it's unlikely that they would have managed to resist.
887000	892000	So you can look back and, but clearly there's a problem here.
892000	894000	There's a generational equity problem.
894000	901000	If you invest too much, it may be that when you look at efficiency,
901000	909000	that it would lead you to invest so much that it really is unfair to early generations.
909000	913000	Well, the early generations present, they should be able to take care of that.
913000	919000	And presumably the early generation in the Soviet Union wouldn't have voted to let Stalin do to them what he did.
919000	924000	But in any case, to protect themselves from that, all they have to do is say,
924000	932000	well, we don't accept the long-term plan where consumption this year,
932000	938000	where consumption next year is more than four percent higher than consumption this year.
938000	940000	I'm talking about aggregate consumption.
940000	942000	So they could protect themselves by doing that.
942000	946000	What we have proposed is a way that when they protect themselves,
946000	952000	they will also simultaneously protect future generations who are not present.
952000	957000	That same four percent is going to be used to say, oh,
957000	968000	but it also is unacceptable if present consumption is four percent higher than future consumption.
968000	974000	Why might that happen in an efficient plan when you're making up an efficient plan?
974000	983000	Well, suppose that the environment is deteriorating very rapidly.
983000	991000	That might mean that it's actually hard for future generations to live at the same level that earlier generations are.
991000	997000	Or suppose technological progress is just very low.
997000	1001000	So the generational equity constraint, the idea of it is to say,
1001000	1010000	when we design procedures to come up with the efficient plan, it still might be an unacceptable plan.
1010000	1012000	It might be unfair to future generations.
1012000	1015000	It might be unfair to present generation.
1015000	1020000	And we're going to eliminate that possibility before we even draw the plan up,
1020000	1024000	before anybody knows what the plan is going to look like.
1024000	1030000	We're going to basically say consumption in any two adjacent years cannot differ by more than four percent,
1030000	1033000	no matter in which direction.
1033000	1035000	So that's our proposal.
1035000	1039000	And I don't think anybody else has ever suggested something like this.
1039000	1042000	And as I said, this is unvetted.
1042000	1048000	But at least it's a serious attempt to take efficient long term,
1048000	1053000	to recognize one potential problem when you're doing efficient long term planning.
1053000	1064000	And that is it might inadvertently be unfair to either present generations compared to future generations or vice versa.
1064000	1067000	So that's that's the first thing.
1067000	1077000	Then the question reduces to what are the different terms in terms of benefits and the costs that you would take into account when you're doing different kinds of planning?
1077000	1087000	The only thing you have to take into account when you're doing investment planning for capital goods or investment goods is this consumption in every year.
1087000	1091000	And these capital goods contribute to consumption.
1091000	1101000	There are no particular other benefits that come from producing a machine or we can produce shoe making machines or we can produce shoes.
1101000	1108000	And the only benefits that come from from shoe making machines are just more shoes at a different time period.
1108000	1111000	That's not true for education.
1111000	1115000	And that's not true for the environment.
1115000	1124000	I mean, as a lifetime educator, I don't think the primary purpose of education is producing a more productive workforce.
1124000	1133000	I think it's the primary purpose of education is enabling people to enjoy life more fully.
1133000	1146000	And I also think a primary purpose of education is preparing everybody to participate democratically in every kind of decision making, including economic decision making.
1146000	1160000	So those are benefits from educate from investing in education that go that are above and beyond an additional that really are not benefits that from making more machines.
1160000	1173000	So the first thing you have to do is you have to sit down and figure out, well, what are all the benefits that come from more education and who would be best suited to estimating what those are likely to be?
1174000	1178000	And then you have to weigh that against the cost of investing in anything.
1178000	1185000	And the cost of investing in anything today is there's less consumption today.
1185000	1188000	So you can write up the efficiency conditions for education.
1188000	1194000	You can write up the efficiency conditions for what's the efficient amount to invest in machines.
1194000	1197000	And the same thing holds for the environment.
1197000	1212000	So in the case of the environment, you know, environmental economists spend a tremendous amount of time trying to estimate what they call the use value of environmental amenities to consumers.
1212000	1223000	So the environment plays a role in production when you think of the environment as being natural capital.
1223000	1228000	You need land to grow food on.
1228000	1230000	You need water.
1230000	1231000	You need oil.
1231000	1234000	The environment also is something we enjoy.
1234000	1237000	We go vacation in it.
1237000	1251000	So there's use value for national parks and you want, you know, and, and then another thing that environmental economists recognize is that there's something called existence value that people place.
1251000	1259000	For instance, I will never go to the ANWR National Preserve up in northern Alaska.
1259000	1261000	I will never go there.
1261000	1273000	That doesn't mean I do not put value on the fact that it exists and we're not going to open up those oil leases that would destroy that park.
1273000	1284000	So that's called sort of, so when you're trying to sort of evaluate environment and how much we should protect it, these are things that environmental economists take into account.
1284000	1286000	They should.
1286000	1303000	So roughly speaking, there's a consumption value to a protected or enhanced environment, as well as we're preserving it as a capital asset and not drawing it down so fast that we have nothing left later.
1303000	1321000	So all of these things have to be taken into account and you have to identify, well, who would be the best people to task with estimating what these somewhat unknowable benefits are going to be in the future?
1321000	1331000	And who are we going to task with estimating the cost of protecting the environment or the cost of producing the education in the future?
1331000	1344000	And so what we have done is we've sort of carefully gone through and tried to identify what consumer federations or producer federations would be best.
1344000	1364000	You have to look at two things. Who actually would have better knowledge about what these effects are going to be and who might have a tendency, who might have an incentive to either over or underestimate a particular effect.
1364000	1376000	So we've tried to do is carefully take those things into account and make tentative proposals about who would you put in charge of making these estimates?
1376000	1392000	And then the planning agency, you can have an environmental planning agency, an educational planning agency, you can just have some, you can have an investment planning agency sort of take those estimates and calculate what the efficient plan would be in each case.
1392000	1403000	Now we're not done. First thing we have to do is test that against the generational equity constraint.
1403000	1412000	Because that plan might violate the generational equity constraint, in which case it's got to be revised and modified.
1412000	1418000	Now you've done that. It either didn't violate or it's revised and modified.
1418000	1429000	What do you then have to do? Well, at that point, we think there needs to be a debate.
1429000	1438000	There needs to be a vote. Is that debate and vote something that's done through the national legislature and the political system?
1438000	1447000	So what we're talking about is approving a long run environmental plan, approving an education plan, approving an investment plan.
1447000	1458000	How do you do that at this point? It could be through legislature discussion debate.
1458000	1467000	It could be put to a referendum. So we're agnostic of all that. I mean, that's what we're saying. Of course, at that point, it should be handled democratic.
1467000	1479000	The place where we think we've done something clever and discovered something that I don't know if other people have discovered is this.
1479000	1495000	We know that whatever plan has been drawn up, check with the generational equity constraint, discuss, debated, voted on.
1495000	1506000	It will it will be mistaken. There will be mistakes because we will have estimated some things wrong.
1506000	1518000	So it's really important to figure out, is there some way to identify when a mistake has been made and is there something you can do about it before it's too late?
1518000	1529000	And what we discovered is that when you look at the results we get from annual plans, so suppose we do an investment plan for 10 years, it's all approved.
1529000	1537000	It's implemented. We also have to have an annual plan for the first year during that investment plan.
1537000	1546000	Now, that annual plan, the investment plan will already tell us how many machines of different kinds we have to produce during that year.
1546000	1553000	The investment plan has decided how much investment goods have to be produced during the first year.
1553000	1572000	So that's a given when we do the annual planning. But at the end of that first year, there is information that will tell us whether or not it actually turned out that we produced the right number of machines.
1572000	1581000	That the results of the annual plan will tell us that there was something wrong with the 10-year investment plan.
1581000	1591000	Now, the important thing, I mean, the important thing is there's still nine years that we can correct for. You can't correct for the first year.
1591000	1599000	It took you a year to discover that something you estimated in the investment plan was actually wrong.
1600000	1607000	The results of the first year showed you it was wrong. That's the clever thing we figured out.
1607000	1615000	You can't go back and undo the first year. So you already invested a little bit wrong in that first year.
1615000	1619000	You can't do anything about that. But you've got nine years left.
1619000	1627000	And there's no reason you can't revise the investment plan after the first year in light of what you just discovered.
1627000	1632000	And that mitigates the sort of welfare losses for the next nine years.
1632000	1638000	And you can do that every year. And of course, it's even more important to do that for your environmental plans.
1638000	1650000	And more important, the longer the planning period, the more important it is, the longer the planning period, the more mistakes the plan will make.
1650000	1658000	The longer the planning period, the harder it is to estimate what those future effects are going to be.
1658000	1673000	Therefore, the longer the planning period, the more valuable it is to be able to identify the errors and then revise that long term plan in order to sort of mitigate the damages.
1673000	1682000	And that's essentially the logic of what we presented for the first time here in part five of the Democratic Planning Book.
1682000	1692000	And I would just say it's unvetted. It's not unvetted in the sense that it hasn't been successfully passed by peer review and published in economic journals.
1692000	1699000	Because the logic is the same whether it's investment planning, education planning or environmental planning.
1699000	1714000	And so it went through the proposal for the investment planning and this whole procedure for identifying errors and correcting errors that we submitted to an economic journal and it's been accepted.
1714000	1728000	I don't think it's in print yet, but at least it went through sort of a pretty careful review process from some reviewers who were very skeptical that we had managed to accomplish what we were claiming.
1728000	1750000	Yeah, I mean, all of the things that you just described within your last answer, what all of this kind of emits as a feeling maybe or what I see coming back into the model of Perricon is allowing more of a political process on a macro level within the model.
1750000	1773000	And this is something I highly appreciate because when you were talking about the anarchist skepticism towards the IFB, the Iteration Facilitation Board, I kind of share this anarchist skepticism towards central plant economies for sure because I'm not a big fan of central plant economies.
1773000	1789000	Definitely, but what I, on the other hand, like myths within the IFB are, and maybe this came through through my questions, are like political processes that might like assist the parametric ones.
1789000	1800000	And within this long term planning, I see this political debate, this need for radical deliberation as a process coming back into the model.
1800000	1817000	And I highly appreciate it, I have to say, because if I understand you correctly, there might be these people who are tasked with like finding out how to do things in the most efficient and ideal way.
1817000	1832000	But at the end, they will have to produce some form of plan, ideally plans, a landscape of different plans that will then be decided upon through a political process, as I understand it.
1832000	1849000	And this is something I think is the actually only way to go, because you cannot go about these questions, education, environment, long term planning, long term investment, just via some form of like utility function, so to speak.
1850000	1860000	No, I think, you know, this is very interesting. And what's curious is, we almost have opposite reactions.
1860000	1868000	So you were looking at the annual planning and saying, there's no real planning here.
1868000	1879000	And there's certainly no sort of political process that's guiding the planning, it seems just nobody is having to think about all of these things.
1879000	1892000	There's this thinking in terms of my own self activity proposal, and a very quick yes or no approving of others based on a very obvious criteria.
1893000	1901000	Where is the discussion, the debate, because there are complicated things about economics, where is the discussion, the debate, it's not there.
1901000	1908000	And then you're looking at our proposals about investment and long term development planning and saying, well, this is more pleasing to me.
1908000	1926000	It's the kind of thing that I've, and I have the opposite reaction, because, and actually there's various places in part five of the book, where I point out what I believe are some unfortunate consequences.
1926000	1946000	And the unfortunate consequences are, when you look at who we propose would be involved in the generation of the plan, it's consumer federations, it's industry federations of workers councils.
1946000	1950000	Those are delegates.
1951000	1959000	That's already one whole huge level removed from an actual worker, an actual consumer.
1959000	1967000	So what I like about the annual planning is, it's the actual workers and actual consumers who are doing it.
1967000	1981000	And what I find, what I find worrisome about the more long term planning stuff is that it's already one level removed from the ordinary citizen.
1981000	2002000	Now we can make sure that the people involved are represented, they're representing, and the procedures for having them elected to be the representatives are very democratic.
2002000	2013000	But I worry about it as, for the ordinary person, does it just sort of, I don't know, there was a whole bunch of long term plans that were drawn up.
2013000	2016000	I don't remember ever being involved in any of that.
2016000	2029000	So I almost see it as a necessary evil, that the objective conditions basically leave us no other choice.
2029000	2042000	When we're coming up with sensible procedures that are democratic, I want them to be efficient, I want them to be fair, I want them to be democratic.
2042000	2054000	I can do all that, but I can't make them as participatory as in your own workers council, you propose what you want to make and how you want to make it and nobody can revise it except for you.
2054000	2057000	I can't do that. And that upsets me.
2059000	2064000	That's very interesting. I mean, there you go. I'd say there you go.
2064000	2075000	There you go. There are questions that cannot be addressed within what is called in Paragon at some point, a self-sovereign workers council, if I'm correct.
2075000	2093000	And so there is not, I would answer maybe in this direction, whether it is on an individual level as a human being or on the level of the workers council, there's always these interdependencies that you yourself always talk about and point towards.
2093000	2114000	And this necessarily creates levels of engagement that are beyond this level of autonomy, the fiction of autonomy on this level that you yourself are able to influence in the manner that you would like it to be in the form of direct participation.
2115000	2124000	There's one other thing that I think is rather curious or interesting about the investment in the long-term development planning.
2124000	2129000	There's a world in which we have to argue about what kind of economy we like.
2129000	2145000	And then there's a much bigger world that has been having an argument over whether or not capitalism, actual real world economies, should be more or less planned than they are.
2145000	2150000	And that's a debate that's gone on since the beginning of capitalism.
2151000	2162000	And what we have just lived through the past 40 years was a huge swing away from planning toward just let the market rip.
2164000	2170000	And of course, different countries have always been in different places on that spectrum.
2170000	2177000	But globally, the spectrum has moved dramatically away from planning.
2177000	2195000	I think that that has proven to be such a palpable sort of mistake that we will see revived interest in planning amongst people who don't give a shit about socialism.
2196000	2215000	And I actually think some of the things that we have now recommended about how a desirable economy would tackle these issues are likely to become of interest to others who are not interested in a truly desirable economy or socialism of any kind.
2215000	2232000	You know, before our debates about market socialism versus Cockshop and Cottrell's Scottish model of planning or the Albert Hanell participatory economy annual planning, because I do think that there are two contributions.
2232000	2238000	So intellectual contributions to this sort of part five of the book.
2238000	2245000	And one is that the rest of the world is not going to be interested in the generational equity constraint.
2245000	2253000	But the rest of the world is going to be very interested in how the results of what just happened this year.
2253000	2260000	They identify where you made mistakes in your long term plan, and there's plenty of time to make corrections.
2260000	2273000	So that contribution is something that anybody doing long term planning of any kind, no matter what kind of economy they're interested in, should actually be very interested in.
2273000	2287000	The other thing is, I sense amongst the younger generation, there's a real sense amongst the younger generation that they want economic decision making to be more democratic and participatory.
2287000	2297000	Their nightmare is going to work for a global capitalist corporation or only the where they're just clogs in the wheel until they join management.
2297000	2318000	So I think that since what we have proposed is how can you do long run planning and make it as participatory as possible and make it democratic also in the end, that that will be an attractive idea to progressive politically minded people.
2318000	2325000	And it's in some sense separable from all the rest of the sort of model of a participatory economy.
2325000	2338000	So I think that there's sort of an opportunity for us to make some headway in some to make some headway in some political circles that are much broader than our usual ones.
2338000	2350000	And all progress will only come, you know, when you have maximized your allies, even if they're temporary.
2350000	2361000	So I think that's also another area in which when we do have sort of a fully vetting of all this about the proposals about doing long term.
2361000	2379000	The other thing is, there's nothing in these proposals about doing long term strategic, you know, strategic international long term planning, education planning, environmental planning, investment planning, that if I were David Schweikert and I had proposed the model of
2379000	2382000	market socialism.
2382000	2387000	That still isn't an answer about how do you go about doing planning.
2387000	2397000	I mean, that's, that's an alternative answer to don't do the annual planning, the participatory annual planning, don't do the central planning and a comprehensive central planning.
2397000	2405000	Leave all that to the markets and make sure that there's no capitalist owners of the workplaces have those be workers councils.
2405000	2411000	But the essence of his proposal simply at that point is and let markets decide all that.
2411000	2428000	And he really doesn't have any sensible proposal, the market socialists don't have sensible proposals about, they don't really they really don't make proposals, just like we, you know, for all these years didn't really make any concrete proposals about procedures for coming up with
2428000	2441000	investment and development plans and checking them for inevitable errors and then who gets to vote on them finally and how is it debated and decided in the end.
2441000	2455000	All of our competitors in the debate about alternatives to capitalism have really said very little about that and there's no reason that any one of them couldn't go ahead and use this as their answer to that question.
2455000	2459000	So there will be new alliances.
2459000	2463000	Don't expect David Schweiker to agree with that, by the way.
2463000	2482000	No, but I mean, I like the idea that you that you say okay, we have this building block now that addresses a whole bunch of questions concerning the question of planning as such, that might be attractive for a whole bunch of different people that that we were that are not our core
2482000	2492000	clientele, so to speak. And so this might be something that that further fuels this renaissance of planning, so to speak.
2492000	2494000	So this is a quite a nice idea.
2494000	2517000	I think that's the payoff for us. The payoff for us is if for 40 years neoliberalism gave planning a bad economic planning a bad reputation demeaned and convinced a large body of the global populace that you know it was just an inefficient mistake.
2517000	2526000	Well, the fact that Chinese capitalism is out competing US capitalism hands over fist is because they have a more planned version of capitalism.
2526000	2535000	So I think there's all sorts of reasons and there's no way you can solve climate change without a lot more planning.
2535000	2549000	So, I look forward to I can see reasonable reasons to expect that the reputation of planning is going to be rescued from the rubbing it took during the 40 year neoliberal period.
2549000	2558000	And that in and of itself is going to make it easier for us to talk about all of the stuff we want to talk about.
2558000	2578000	So I think that's a plus for us. Not only do we have some ideas they could make use of. I think that anything that makes people more have a more friendly attitude toward the idea of economic planning is just got to help us going forward.
2578000	2593000	I'm very much interested in the question of real life paragon examples and specifically whether or not there are examples of experiments that you know of that really try to tackle the question of scale.
2593000	2603000	So maybe even that try to make use of modern information and communication technologies in order to tackle this question of scale.
2603000	2617000	Do you know of any such experiments that try to envision an idea, not only envision an idea of paragon, but to also practice it?
2617000	2627000	Good question. And at some point we're going to connect this up to the issue of transition strategy.
2627000	2645000	So let me sow a seed for that connection that will come. Very broadly speaking, I think transition strategy comes down to two rather different kinds of things.
2645000	2665000	Two rather different kinds of organizing activities. One of which I call building and strengthening progressive social movements, the labor movement, the women's movement, the anti-racist movement, the anti-corporate movement.
2665000	2679000	These are all progressive movements where there are clearly problems in capitalism, in the existing society that clearly need to be addressed.
2679000	2686000	Large numbers of people are adversely affected by the problems that these different movements address.
2686000	2704000	So this is the opportunity for us to reach out to the broadest number of people and engage with them in activities that can win substantial victories even without economic system change.
2704000	2724000	And then the question becomes how do you participate in those movements in ways that not only win reforms, but also lead people to want even greater reforms and come to the conclusion that that can't happen at some point unless you have fundamental system change.
2724000	2747000	The other activity, the other major kind of organizing activity that I think is going to be necessary in many places for a successful transition is what I call building and creating real life experiences and equitable cooperation.
2747000	2762000	And that's actually organizing activities where we're starting to put into place what we are saying we want the entire economy and society to be able to do.
2762000	2772000	Now historically, probably the oldest example is this, is workers-owned cooperatives.
2772000	2786000	And there's a tendency amongst leftists to basically see our entire history as being the labor movement and unions.
2786000	2799000	And yet you could argue, particularly right now, the labor movement and unions in the United States are probably weaker than they have been.
2799000	2808000	You'd have to go back to the 1870s to find a period where the labor movement in the United States is as weak as it is presently.
2809000	2823000	So it's rather interesting that, on the other hand, the movement for workers cooperatives in the United States is not in such heavy decline as the labor movement is.
2823000	2837000	So that's one area. And I would say that workers cooperatives, now you want an example of workers cooperatives that's, and in terms of scale, some of them are rather large.
2838000	2840000	I mean, take a look at northern Italy.
2842000	2855000	I think a third of the economic activity in northern Italy is activity that is this whole system of sort of workers cooperatives and cooperatives that operates in northern Italy.
2855000	2860000	Or you look at Mondragon, you know, in the Basque region of Spain.
2860000	2864000	So some of these are not little tiny experiments.
2864000	2870000	Another example I would give is the whole idea of participatory budgeting.
2871000	2874000	And it's very interesting.
2874000	2884000	This idea came up in two places in the world, and I know from personal experience that neither one of them was aware of what was going on in the other place.
2885000	2894000	So this idea that we want to do participatory budgeting, what does that mean?
2894000	2903000	Well, city budgets are basically decided by sort of the city government bureaucracy.
2904000	2921000	And in Porto Alegre, Brazil, the Workers' Party, the Lula Workers' Party, came up with the idea that, you know, we want some percentage of the tax revenues of the city to be set aside.
2921000	2935000	And how they are used should be decided by different neighborhoods in the city are going to have assemblies, and they're going to go through a process of discussing how it is they'd like to have that money spent.
2935000	2942000	They're part of the money. They're going to decide how it's spent through some sort of neighborhood assemblies.
2945000	2948000	And that was what they called a participatory budgeting.
2948000	2970000	And at the same time, one of the most leftist states in India, which is Kerala, India, that the, in Kerala, India, there was a period, I mean, actually the Communist Party has been the ruling party in Kerala, India, two or three different times over the past 50 years.
2971000	2980000	And they had a more or less traditional sort of Marxist and Communist program when they governed.
2980000	2998000	And then in the early 2000s, a new generation of leaders in that party in Kerala, India, said, you know, when we govern, we basically have been trying to implement serve the people programs.
3000000	3003000	But that's not really what we're all about.
3004000	3010000	We also want to empower people to make decisions about how they best serve themselves.
3011000	3021000	And so they also pioneered a participatory budgeting process, and they ran on that platform and they were elected on that platform.
3021000	3039000	And for about a period of 10 years before they were voted out of power, they implemented this very elaborate participatory budgeting process where they literally had 20% of the population attending assemblies and meetings.
3039000	3046000	Making decisions about how they wanted to see the tax revenues spent on what kinds of projects and what kinds of programs.
3046000	3054000	Well, obviously, participatory budgeting, you know, is, it's two things.
3054000	3058000	It's an expression to the fact that this is something people want.
3058000	3071000	It's an expression of the fact that it also affords us real life experience about what are the pros and cons of trying to organize it in one kind of way or another kind of way.
3071000	3077000	Participatory economic decision making about how it is we want things done.
3077000	3086000	And it also, to the degree that it is successful, and in both these places, it was remarkably successful.
3086000	3097000	I mean, it wasn't lack of success in these programs that led to the electoral defeat of the Workers' Party in Brazil or the Communist Party in Kerala.
3097000	3104000	These programs were popular. Their electoral defeat was due to other causes.
3104000	3123000	It also just, it builds people's confidence that these kinds of things work and that they aren't just pie in the sky and somehow all these important economic decisions are best left to somebody else.
3123000	3127000	So those are some examples of big things.
3127000	3147000	Now, I mentioned that there were a couple of places, very small types of operations that really tried to implement the entire proposal, including effort and sacrifice rating and balancing jobs for empowerment and all of that.
3147000	3155000	And there were a series of small collectives that were organized jointly. It was called the A-Zone.
3155000	3162000	And they had a series of buildings in the city of Winnipeg in Canada.
3162000	3175000	And, I mean, the businesses, there was a bicycle repair business, there was a recording studio record business, there was a restaurant, there was the Mondragon Cafe restaurant.
3175000	3184000	They did a bicycle delivery program. I couldn't believe they delivered bicycles through the winter in Winnipeg when the snow was six feet high.
3184000	3191000	Obviously, this is a seasonal business. No? What do you mean seasonal? We deliver all year round.
3191000	3199000	In any case, so these people had read about participatory economics and said, we're going to do it.
3199000	3210000	We're going to at least do the part that has to do with how would a workers council run, you know, in these ways. And they did it for about 15 to 20 years.
3210000	3219000	And there's a really rich experience there of what sort of problems did they run into, what kinds of conflicts came up, what worked, what didn't work.
3219000	3226000	And I can tell you that one of the things that was most problematic was the effort rating.
3226000	3232000	And whether or not people were comfortable with it, whether they weren't comfortable with it, how to go about it, what to do about it.
3232000	3235000	And that's a rich experience to learn from.
3235000	3255000	The other place that very self-consciously applied, you know, tried to apply all these was the South End Press, which was a left press in Boston for they did finally go out of business about four or five years ago now.
3255000	3265000	But it was a very successful left press, you know, in the United States that operated for about 30 years.
3265000	3276000	And it was always organized along the, according to the principles of participatory economy in terms of balancing jobs, remuneration, all of that.
3276000	3284000	And if you take a look at other left presses, they're basically a pretty standard business model.
3284000	3299000	Usually there is some sort of major donor who has sort of poured a lot of money into it, but then it runs more or less, you know, the same way that other publishers, you know, book publishers do.
3299000	3314000	And there was a big question about, well, is South End Press going to be, is the standard business model for a publisher going to prove to be more competitively successful in the book publishing industry than South End Press is?
3314000	3320000	Which is insisting on apply, you know, running itself in a very, very different way.
3320000	3328000	And you could say, well, South End Press no longer exists, but it wasn't because it wasn't successful at publishing book for all those years.
3328000	3346000	It was amongst the most successful of left publishing houses in the United States during the time of its operation, which provides some evidence that, no, these things aren't so in, these ideas and suggestions about how better to organize work processes.
3346000	3365000	They aren't so limiting to productivity that people applying those principles and working in that way cannot be perfectly successful in competition with businesses that are being run along standard or what you might call capitalist principles.
3365000	3370000	I have some macro and some micro questions, I guess.
3370000	3393000	Let's start with the micro ones, because you stated that taken from the real life experience, one of the most problematic aspects of Perikan that was causing the most trouble was the, this idea of effort ratings that one judges his or her coworker,
3393000	3397000	and then the remuneration would be coupled to this kind of judgment.
3397000	3411000	And when I was reading about Perikan, this was immediately something that I could not get along with because I immediately thought this will definitely lead to some sort of toxic environment.
3411000	3423000	So if you hear about these experiments and then people who actually try to implement these ideas and they give you the feedback that this is something that actually did not work out,
3423000	3429000	why do you then stick to this principle in your most recent work, for example?
3429000	3447000	Why don't you, because usually one would think that this would lead you to a point where you would have to revise the idea of effort ratings and maybe stick to a different kind of model of how remuneration could be addressed, as you did with housework and care work.
3447000	3455000	Okay, first of all, so let me just say sort of three things to situate the discussion.
3455000	3461000	Our actual proposal is that workers councils do whatever the hell they want in this regard.
3461000	3469000	So, I have no trouble taking that position, but I consider that to be a principal position.
3469000	3480000	And the second thing is, while we recommend that you would want to do something about this, we leave it up to you how to do it.
3480000	3503000	And I am sure that if there were a participatory economy with hundreds of thousands of different workplaces, that there would be a huge difference in how different workplaces went on, you know, decided to go about this, including when they decided to do anything along these lines at all.
3503000	3508000	And I don't think that's a bad thing.
3508000	3515000	Because here's an area where we're not sure how work, we're not really sure how things work out.
3515000	3533000	And in that context, whenever you find yourself in that situation, having a social experiment where you have a very wide variety of people trying things that are quite different from one another is sort of a sensible way to find out what works best and what doesn't.
3533000	3545000	The third thing I'd say is, I think there's a huge difference between leftists and normal people on this subject.
3545000	3554000	Most leftist reaction to, do I want somebody sitting in judgment about whether I'm working very hard?
3554000	3560000	Do I want to sit in judgment of my co-workers about whether they're working very hard?
3560000	3566000	Most leftists just don't like that.
3566000	3569000	I don't like it.
3569000	3576000	I would choose a workplace where we all were more or less on the honor system.
3577000	3580000	I mean, where would I want to work in a participatory economy?
3580000	3588000	I would look for a place that was on the honor system extreme of the spectrum, because that's what I would be most comfortable with.
3588000	3602000	Both from the point of view of whether somebody else is judging whether I've been working very hard and whether I want to really get myself in the, do I want to put myself in a position where I'm getting into fellow workers' faces about, you haven't been working very hard this last month.
3602000	3615000	But I don't think that, I think there's a huge difference between people who are already progressive and leftist on this subject in terms of their own personal attitudes and normal people.
3615000	3630000	I think amongst normal people, the whole idea that, well, if the people that I'm working with aren't working very hard, and I am, I got a problem with that.
3630000	3645000	And are you proposing an economic system where I would just become victim of a bunch of, you know, a bunch of gold-brickers and slaggers in my own workplace, and they're going to, you're telling me that they're going to get paid the same thing I am?
3645000	3648000	There's no remedy for that.
3648000	3651000	So that's where I come down on it.
3651000	3654000	I'm not surprised it's controversial.
3654000	3661000	I think the average sentiment amongst leftists and people who aren't leftists is actually rather remarkably different on the subject.
3661000	3673000	I also think that what we leftists want and are comfortable with might require a learning process.
3673000	3691000	It's not that what we want isn't better, but it might be that we need a history of people being responsible to their workmates.
3691000	3693000	We need a history of that.
3693000	3703000	I think the thing that's annoying or troubling is making invidious comparisons.
3703000	3710000	We don't want people making invidious comparisons about us, and we don't want to make invidious comparisons about other people.
3710000	3720000	Well, the way to avoid the necessity of invidious comparisons is a historical track record of people behaving responsibly.
3720000	3733000	Once people discover that people are behaving more and more responsibly because things are set up so that you're rewarded for behaving responsibly,
3733000	3746000	once people discover that that's the case, then I think that my expectation would be that the amount of time and energy that goes into effort rating
3746000	3754000	or sort of trying to measure whether somebody made a greater or lesser sacrifice than somebody else for purposes of compensation,
3754000	3759000	the amount of time and energy and people just paying attention to that.
3759000	3765000	There's a reason that economic justice is such an incredibly important touch point for everybody,
3765000	3773000	because we have all been victims of economic injustice and we've witnessed and experienced economic injustice.
3773000	3778000	So it's a hot issue.
3778000	3782000	People care a hell of a lot about it, and they should, and we should.
3782000	3793000	But will that be the case in a society where economic injustice has basically, I mean, you're never going to completely eliminate it.
3793000	3799000	But where economic injustice is no longer sort of a prime concern in people's lives,
3799000	3809000	well, then is it unreasonable to expect that people will just care less about it and therefore put less time and energy into whatever sort of systems
3809000	3817000	people would set up to go about measuring, you know, whether there's differences in sacrifices.
3817000	3825000	The other thing is the one other thing I'll say on this subject is I don't think there's any dishonor in putting in less effort.
3825000	3837000	I don't want to work at maximum effort intensity all the time.
3837000	3842000	Now, my wife is a very different personality.
3842000	3845000	She almost can't stop herself from doing it.
3845000	3853000	But I do recognize that on average she's putting in more effort when she goes to work than what I do.
3853000	3862000	And I'm perfectly happy to accept that my compensation would be somewhat less.
3862000	3879000	So the proposal is, I think we want to leave people with the personal choice of just how intensely, you know, how much sacrifice and how much effort do you want to sink into your work activity
3879000	3882000	as compared to working in working less hours.
3882000	3887000	That's easy or working in a more laid back way.
3887000	3891000	I think that's something that I'm happy to leave up the personal choice.
3891000	3904000	On the other hand, as somebody who would choose a more leisurely sort of pace of work, then I'm happy to accept somewhat less compensation for the fact for that.
3904000	3907000	That's my personal choice.
3907000	3913000	And I'm happy to accept somewhat less compensation and somebody who's going to work more intensively.
3913000	3918000	I'm perfectly happy and think they deserve to have somewhat more compensation.
3918000	3921000	Anyway, those are my thoughts on the subject.
3922000	3932000	And it's been amongst people's reactions to the sort of participatory economics proposal.
3932000	3936000	It's been one of the things where the reaction has been sort of most strong.
3936000	3938000	There's absolutely no doubt about that.
3938000	3948000	In the history of socialism, the subject that there's been an equal amount of controversy on is a little bit different, though.
3948000	3966000	In the history of socialism, basically, the debate has been does everybody get paid the same per hour of work would be one or if your work is more socially valuable than my work, do you deserve to get paid more?
3966000	3971000	That's been debated hot and heavily throughout the history of socialism.
3971000	3985000	And the spectrum on that has varied back and forth in every country that called itself socialist, you know, during the entire 20th century.
3985000	3988000	This is a little different. It's a different controversy.
3988000	3993000	It's a different place. It's a different issue that many people have a difference of opinion on.
3993000	3999000	And I have to say, when I read your book, I absolutely agree with your argument against both of these.
3999000	4007000	Against the measurement by labor time and against the measurement by quote unquote contribution.
4007000	4019000	But I have to add I'm also against remuneration according to effort and sacrifice because what you just did, you kind of picked a more or less uncontroversial situation
4019000	4028000	where you yourself agree with the assessment that you did not put as much effort into the work than somebody else than your wife.
4028000	4041000	But of course, the difficult thing to do would be to decide within situations where the person that thinks she or he is putting in a lot of effort,
4041000	4050000	the self experience of how much effort I put in is not identical to the judgment by one's peers.
4050000	4055000	And these are the toxic situations that would make it explosive.
4055000	4063000	That's right. If your peers judge you more harshly than your own self judgment is where the conflict comes.
4063000	4067000	And let me add on that. I think that will happen.
4067000	4074000	And sometimes when I write about it, it happened to me at my university where I worked for 37 years.
4074000	4079000	I was undervalued all the time and I got paid less than I should have been.
4079000	4085000	And I resented it. And it's very important that will happen.
4085000	4091000	I mean, one remedy for that is that you fight. I mean, you have to basically challenge the judgment.
4091000	4094000	And then the question is, well, what's the process?
4094000	4099000	But the ultimate remedy for that is don't stay where I mean, the only reason I stayed working.
4099000	4106000	I eventually left as soon as I could. I mean, I was there for 35 years, but that's because I have four children and I was raised.
4106000	4110000	I mean, and my wife had a job and it made no sense to leave.
4110000	4118000	And once you're a tenured professor, as much as they underpay you, it's still a great job compared to almost any other job.
4118000	4126000	But the remedy, I mean, the remedy for that is make it easy for people to leave.
4126000	4134000	If you're not being appreciated where you work, it's not so terrible if it's easy for you to go and find a place.
4134000	4143000	And if you're right, if it's easy for you to go find another place to work and if you're right, you'll find one that actually appreciates you more.
4144000	4149000	Which proved to be the case in my case when I finally was able to move to a different city.
4149000	4158000	I got I got treated much more fairly at the university out here in Portland than I was treated at American University for 34 years.
4158000	4165000	It's frustrating when you can't move, but if you can move and if you're right, then that's the remedy.
4165000	4170000	Basically, what you're saying is your fellow workers are discriminating against you and it's very bad.
4170000	4174000	I mean, it's a very bad feeling. I remember it.
4174000	4180000	And I'm not the kind of leftist that pretends these things won't happen even in a good society.
4180000	4190000	So the question reduces to when these unfortunate life experiences do happen, then have we got some sort of remedy or way of handling them?
4191000	4204000	That's the best that we could do, which means that ease of moving from one worker council to another worker council becomes a very important thing to achieve.
4204000	4211000	You want to make it very easy for people to move from one another worker council because there will be all sorts of reasons that people want to move.
4211000	4218000	And one of them will be I don't think I'm being treated fairly by my workmates.
4218000	4225000	It might not just be remuneration. I mean, there are all sorts of other ways in which your workmates might not be treating you fairly.
4225000	4233000	And it's always miserable to stay in contact with a whole bunch of people who aren't treating you fairly.
4233000	4237000	Yes. Well, I understand the remark to moving.
4237000	4245000	And I think it would take up too much time to go even deeper into the question of whether or not this is a good idea to implement.
4245000	4254000	And I very much appreciate the fact that Paracon is so flexible to allow different workers councils to handle this.
4254000	4258000	On this issue, it would be disingenuous to say we're flexible on a subject.
4258000	4265000	I mean, we've been famously denounced for not being flexible about markets.
4265000	4272000	And just because I thought sometimes it helps to draw the battle lines for the discussion,
4272000	4277000	I decided to go ahead and call myself a market abolitionist.
4277000	4283000	So there are some things that we're not flexible about, but yet this we are flexible about.
4283000	4291000	And actually, to be very honest with you, I think some of us who say we are advocates for a participatory economy,
4291000	4297000	some of us are more flexible about it and some of us are a little less flexible about it.
4297000	4302000	Well, I'm happy to hear that in general about this issue, you're flexible.
4302000	4309000	And I'm also happy just as a side note that you are not flexible on the question of markets.
4309000	4312000	So I do agree on that part as well.
4312000	4318000	Well, so I already stated the micro question, so to speak.
4318000	4321000	I have a macro question as well.
4321000	4329000	And this would be you just sketched on the one part, examples in terms of workers cooperatives.
4329000	4336000	It's very easy to imagine how this might work and how these might lead into situations of, let's say,
4336000	4346000	prefigurative politics that might be a place to learn all of the also social skills that you need
4346000	4353000	in order to live and work and everything else in a participatory economy.
4353000	4357000	So these experiments on a smaller scale are very easy to imagine.
4357000	4366000	You also sketched experiments in Kerala and in Porto Alegre in terms of participatory budgeting.
4366000	4370000	So now let's go even a step further.
4370000	4381000	How would we go about if we wanted to do experiments that are scalable, that are large in scale,
4381000	4387000	but are not restricted to, quote unquote, only the question of participatory budgeting,
4387000	4394000	but try to implement Perikon in its whole, in a larger context?
4394000	4401000	Are there any ideas of how experiments that would try to do this could go about?
4401000	4408000	There's two things that you might sort of think about in this regard.
4408000	4416000	The easiest one is some leftist movement comes to power in some country,
4416000	4423000	and they have no intentions of trying to run a centrally planned economy.
4423000	4426000	And they're not disciples of market socialism.
4426000	4430000	They're not enamored of markets.
4430000	4438000	Could a country go about setting up an economy run in some ways along the lines of a participatory economy?
4438000	4441000	Could they do annual participatory planning?
4441000	4448000	Could they do the kind of environmental planning and education planning and investment planning that we've outlined?
4448000	4450000	Could they try to do that?
4450000	4456000	There's no reason that a country, there's no reason that a movement coming to power in any country couldn't try this.
4456000	4461000	And situations have arisen where that was a possibility.
4461000	4470000	In Sri Lanka, there's what's primarily an ethnic conflict.
4470000	4481000	And about a third of the population has been in conflict with the majority population in government for decades and decades and decades.
4481000	4489000	And at some point in the early 1990s, it looked like that liberation movement had managed to liberate a third of the island.
4489000	4496000	And they were interested in, well, we now have to figure out how to run our economy.
4496000	4508000	And I talked with various, I mean, it just so happened that there were students at my university that were connected to that movement.
4508000	4513000	It could have happened. It didn't. But it could have happened.
4513000	4525000	And it would have provided a real life experiment of some people who were leftists trying to organize the economy in a very different way than any leftists have ever done in history.
4525000	4530000	And it would have given us some sort of evidence about what works and what doesn't work.
4530000	4538000	I was invited down to Cuba in 1990 to consult with them about their planning system.
4538000	4548000	Because there was dissatisfaction amongst Cuban economists and various people in the Cuban planning ministry and the Cuban Communist Party.
4548000	4552000	They weren't that happy about how their economy was run.
4552000	4557000	And they were interested in ideas about how they might make it.
4557000	4567000	Their basic complaint was, our economy is sort of just this slow, sluggish thing that doesn't motivate anybody to do anything.
4567000	4573000	And my response was, why are you surprised?
4574000	4584000	But you could change your planning system, you know, in a way that actually gave people a reason to care, to participate.
4584000	4595000	And one of the things that I've known for a long, long time in the case of Cuba is, very early in the revolution, they established these things called Committees for Defense of the Revolution.
4595000	4599000	These are neighborhood committees.
4599000	4606000	And I, in some ways, these neighborhood committees have basically, they've done some bad things.
4606000	4615000	They've basically become the eyes of the government on, you know, who's a little bit, who's a dissident.
4615000	4625000	On the other hand, these neighborhood committees also have a lot of power over, you know, distribution of goods and services.
4625000	4633000	And, you know, how it is that new housing is sort of built and who gets, you know, who it's assigned to and things like this.
4633000	4643000	So I realized that if you think about a participatory economy, well, there's always workplaces.
4643000	4655000	The thing that doesn't exist anywhere that we are saying is an important part of how we think the economy has to be run is our neighborhood consumption councils.
4655000	4666000	And what I realized was they actually have the neighborhood consumption councils in Cuba, and we can make them do good things and stop them from doing bad things.
4666000	4670000	But they've existed, they've been there for 40 years.
4670000	4679000	So, unfortunately, I mean, I consulted there, and this was in 1990, and it was right when the Soviet Union was collapsing.
4679000	4688000	And Cuba was entering through no fault of their own into what was called the special period where their GDP basically shrunk by half through no fault of their own.
4688000	4697000	And so I was supposed to go down there and consult with economists and various people in the planning ministry about some new, new innovative ideas.
4697000	4701000	And nobody had any time for anything other than how the hell are we going to survive this?
4701000	4705000	And they barely did. But that's a possibility.
4705000	4719000	When Chavez came to power in Venezuela, he invited a lot of people in from around the country to help him try and think through, well, how do we want to do our, I mean, what's our economic policy and program and what's our future economic vision like?
4719000	4741000	Because, I mean, I know from a fact from people who were sitting in the meetings that Chavez, who was very, very good close personal friends with Fidel Castro, and Chavez said to Castro, we don't really want to copy your economic model.
4741000	4747000	And I also know Fidel Castro said back to him, good, don't.
4747000	4765000	And so they were looking for something else. And I consulted twice for an institute that the Chavez government set up explicitly to bring in sort of people from outside the country to help them with various ideas about what was their economic policy, etc.
4765000	4780000	And one of the things they did, they created more workers co-ops faster in Venezuela than have ever been created any place as part of their transition to.
4780000	4789000	They made good use of the high oil price and basically financed a huge number of workers co-ops.
4789000	4794000	Now they were criticized because the failure rate was very high.
4794000	4805000	But I thought they were very sensible. They said, look, the failure rate is very high. On the other hand, the ones that didn't fail, there's a lot of them.
4805000	4822000	And we had the damn money. So yeah, if you're going to do something big, then there's going to be a higher failure rate because you're going to finance a bunch that really weren't that they were bad bets to survive.
4822000	4836000	So they did. They created a rather large, I mean, they created a cooperative sector of their economy, you know, and grew it faster than I think the cooperative sector of any economy has ever grown.
4836000	4843000	And they saw it simply as this is part of our, this is part of a transition society, you know.
4843000	4850000	And part of their strategy also was they did not want to nationalize.
4850000	4862000	Partly for political reasons, they thought that they would, that they would provoke the opposition and they hesitated to nationalize in order not to provoke.
4862000	4869000	And partly they didn't nationalize because they said, we don't want to nationalize anything until we know how we're going to run it.
4869000	4878000	And we're still trying to figure out how to run it. And that's part of the reason they had brought people like me and a bunch of other people from around the world with
4878000	4883000	bright ideas that we were all trying to sell about how you should try and organize your economy.
4883000	4886000	That's one way it can happen.
4886000	4899000	Now, another way it could happen is what if you had maybe a section of a fairly large city with a very large and active movement.
4899000	4905000	And they said, we just want to create a participatory economy in our section of the city.
4905000	4918000	And what gives me this idea that I was in Greece for a conference at the sort of the height of the Syriza sort of power.
4918000	4925000	And I was staying in a hotel and the conference was being held in a city that basically was in leftist hands.
4925000	4929000	There was a whole section of Athens that was in.
4929000	4937000	And people had asked me, well, why couldn't we just do a participatory economy, you know, in our part of the city?
4937000	4946000	And my original answer was, oh, I mean, no, the whole thing only works if it's the whole if it's a national economy.
4946000	4949000	And then I realized, well, wait a minute.
4949000	4958000	We actually have a proposal for how it is that a small participatory economy would interact with.
4958000	4964000	Countries through trade and everything that, you know, that have capitalist economies.
4964000	4973000	Why couldn't this section of Athens basically organize itself with workers councils and consumer councils and do all this wonderful thing?
4973000	4981000	Now, a lot of what a lot of what they need to buy and a lot of what they need to sell is with outsiders.
4981000	4985000	But that's no different than a small country.
4985000	4994000	Has to deal through trade or even international financial investment, you know, with other countries.
4994000	5007000	My original reaction was would like nothing better than it's a viable strategy to say here we believe that we're going to start it and then we'll get experience.
5007000	5011000	People will see that it works.
5011000	5014000	My original reaction is it just doesn't work that way.
5014000	5027000	That's, you know, that you have to somehow have a strategy where you're going to be, you know, you're the majority of the country wants to do it and reorganize the national economy that way.
5027000	5040000	I'm not now. I'm not so sure that now I'm not so sure that it has to be some country where a political movement comes to power that wants to try it.
5040000	5045000	I'm not sure that it couldn't be.
5045000	5053000	I mean, in Athens, there were probably 50,000 people who lived in that section of Athens.
5053000	5065000	I think it probably would be possible for 50,000 people, you know, in a city like Athens to say we want to actually run the economy in this part of the city this way.
5065000	5074000	And we even know how to interact in terms of trade with other parts of the city, other parts of Greece that we know aren't running this way.
5074000	5079000	And does it have to be a geographical unit?
5079000	5084000	So, I mean, there are cooperatives all over the world.
5084000	5098000	There are information and communication technologies that absolutely hold the potential to kind of mediate between those.
5098000	5120000	And so one might think another possibility could be to have some kind of parallel system that is not defined through a specific geography, a specific place where people would have to where everybody would have to agree that this is the way to go.
5120000	5131000	But that there could be, as I said, some kind of parallel system that defines itself through the people who already want to participate in such an experiment.
5131000	5142000	That's an interesting idea. In the Internet era, I think that that is a possibility that would never have occurred to me in the past.
5142000	5146000	But they can't, but not with a cryptocurrency, please.
5146000	5151000	OK, just don't go to the don't don't go to a cryptocurrency on me.
5151000	5156000	I get a rash as soon as somebody says cryptocurrency.
5156000	5166000	There's one way that you can connect up that I do believe has not been taken advantage of to the extent that it should be.
5166000	5169000	There is an international cooperative movement.
5169000	5175000	It's been around for hundreds of years now.
5175000	5183000	And the international cooperative movement, one of its principles is that co-ops should help other co-ops.
5183000	5197000	And the form in which that's taken has basically been, well, a well established, long established co-op that's basically on pretty firm financial ground.
5197000	5200000	Maybe it should, you know, it has an obligation.
5200000	5210000	It has a duty as sort of a member of the international cooperative movement to establish advice for people trying to start up a new co-op.
5210000	5218000	You know, we've got experience, we've got advice or even establish some sort of, you know, financial aid, you know, help give them startup money.
5218000	5221000	That's been around for a long time and it's good.
5222000	5231000	And I published an article in the Eastern Economic Journal, probably about 10 years ago, saying, you know, we could take that a further step.
5231000	5243000	And it's very similar to what you're talking about, because these co-ops are not even in the same country.
5243000	5252000	You know, who are members of this international association and who do engage in this solidaristic type of behavior.
5252000	5256000	Why don't they when trading between them?
5256000	5264000	But what they do is they all trade to the extent that they trade amongst themselves.
5264000	5268000	They trade through markets.
5268000	5274000	And we know that's actually not a good way to do it.
5274000	5287000	So why couldn't they agree to trade amongst themselves in a way that is essentially.
5287000	5297000	Giving the majority of the efficiency gained from the trade to the weaker of the co-ops.
5297000	5304000	Now, in order to do that, you have to have some way of sort of empirically establishing what are the weaker of the co-ops.
5304000	5317000	But I wrote an article in the Eastern Economic Journal saying, you know, I think that the international cooperative movement could take a further step in a direction that they've always shown themselves inclined to want to go.
5317000	5327000	And this would actually be materially far more advantageous to the new co-ops and the weaker co-ops.
5327000	5332000	So just from the point of view of, are you going to grow your movement more successfully?
5332000	5335000	I think I can recommend it on those grounds.
5335000	5339000	And does it take you in the direction of.
5339000	5341000	That is the problem.
5341000	5348000	Most people who work in the co-ops don't see anything wrong with markets.
5348000	5355000	So it's a hard sell because what I want to sell them is you never really like market exchange.
5355000	5357000	You always wanted to do.
5357000	5361000	You always would have rather have done it another way, but you never had the opportunity.
5361000	5368000	But amongst yourselves, amongst yourselves, you can create the opportunity.
5368000	5374000	But that would require you to have already come to the conclusion that part of the problem is markets.
5374000	5383000	And part of what prevents us from achieving our cooperative goal is that we unfortunately have to operate in the markets.
5384000	5390000	Because what I was proposing is I can pose a way for you to get out at least amongst your interrelations.
5390000	5399000	I can I can free you from the sort of market exchange process that is always problematic for you.
5399000	5404000	If you don't think it's problematic, then the idea isn't that interesting.
5404000	5410000	But I think it's very in some ways, it's similar to what you were talking about, which is.
5411000	5422000	Like minded people don't have to be geographically, you know, contiguous necessarily in order to to engage in some sort of
5422000	5430000	collaborative activity that starts to look like participatory economic practices.
5430000	5439000	Oh, and I wrote it at the time that I was consulting in Venezuela because they were creating all these co-ops.
5439000	5446000	And so one of the things I wanted to talk to them, I did talk to them about, I said, look, you're doing a great job of creating the co-ops.
5446000	5449000	Good thing you got all that high oil price right now.
5449000	5451000	Don't worry about the failure rate.
5451000	5463000	But if the ones that aren't failing, look, here's a next step that and there I had an audience that at least for a period of time was not the typical.
5463000	5474000	I mean, the international cooperative movement basically sided with the United States and denounced the Chavez government.
5474000	5482000	They took the Western pro-U.S. attitude on Venezuela.
5482000	5496000	And it was sort of embarrassing because the Venezuelans reached out to that movement, invited them to come in Venezuela and help them think about how to establish a bunch of co-ops.
5496000	5508000	And the leaders of the international cooperative movement were busy agreeing with US State Department evaluation of this whole social experiment in Venezuela.
5508000	5514000	But I was there at the same time.
5514000	5525000	And that's when I said, look, I now remember why I wrote the whole damn article and published it in the Eastern Economic Journal was because I was actually thinking the Venezuelans,
5525000	5533000	unlike a lot of people in the cooperative movement who find no problem with markets, they do have a problem with markets.
5533000	5539000	The Venezuelan government and movement, the Bolivarian revolutionaries.
5539000	5542000	And yet they're very busy setting up all these co-ops.
5542000	5545000	So they are an ideal audience to talk with.
5545000	5556000	Is there a way that you can start to establish relations amongst these workers co-ops that is a non-market exchange process amongst them?
5556000	5571000	And since we are already touching upon the subject of digital mediation, information and communication technologies and how they might inform such experiments,
5571000	5584000	I also did an episode of Future Histories with Daniel E. Saros, who wrote a book that you at least commented on in your last book yourself and called it Amazon Socialism.
5584000	5600000	So he does propose a so-called general catalog in which he proposes that everybody, every workers council should post the use values that it produces.
5600000	5618000	And then everybody would also have a so-called needs profile in which one could place one's needs in a certain order in order to communicate how important these needs are for myself
5618000	5626000	and thereby also informing the production process of the workers councils.
5626000	5633000	What do you think about his proposal and where would you see connections to Perricon?
5633000	5639000	I mean, he states pretty clearly that his proposal is very much informed by Perricon.
5639000	5652000	So there are like considerable overlaps, but what are the strengths of his proposal from your point of view and what are the weaknesses?
5652000	5659000	Well, first of all, there's an appendix to democratic economic planning.
5659000	5681000	And in the appendix, I present and then evaluate from my perspective, the strengths and weaknesses of other people's proposals about how to go about
5681000	5685000	socialist planning or democratic, socialist economic planning.
5685000	5693000	And so one of the, I think I do Cotshot and Cottrell.
5693000	5697000	David Labrum's proposal.
5697000	5702000	Dan Saros' proposal.
5702000	5706000	Pat Devine and Frick with Adam's proposal.
5706000	5722000	And then I also review, I call them the sort of autonomous community, the autonomous community sort of approach.
5722000	5726000	Because most people associate that with Schumacher.
5727000	5740000	So I actually, and I don't want to try and recreate that sort of, because part of the problem with Dan's proposal is it's not his fault.
5740000	5743000	It's very complicated.
5743000	5754000	And it really, it takes a lot of work to figure out exactly what he's proposing and how it works.
5754000	5763000	I mean, I had to communicate with him back and forth for a year and a half, just asking him questions about, am I understanding this right?
5763000	5772000	And so it took me a long time to figure out exactly how his proposal works.
5772000	5784000	But I think I did, and I got him to confirm that, because I don't want to evaluate something where the person who, because I've had this happen to me all the time.
5784000	5791000	Somebody is saying they're criticizing participatory economics, but they're criticizing something I didn't propose.
5791000	5799000	So I wanted to be careful that at least I understood what he was proposing before I said, well, this is what I think is, here's where I think this is good.
5799000	5800000	This is what I think is good about it.
5800000	5804000	And this is what I find problematic.
5804000	5808000	First, let me say that I think everybody should read it.
5808000	5831000	I mean, he has gone farther in the direction of saying, new information technologies have created a new technological situation in which we can now think about what is possible and not possible.
5831000	5854000	So I think he is the part that I find most, most helpful and most insightful is the degree to which he is telling all of us, wake up and rethink everything that you thought could be done or couldn't be done.
5854000	5863000	And ask yourself, were you thinking about that in the context of a pre-information technology revolution?
5863000	5864000	Because guess what?
5864000	5866000	We've had one.
5866000	5878000	So I think that's the strength, that he is the, he's the first one who's come along among socialist planner type thinkers to say, we need to take advantage of new information technology.
5878000	5890000	In some ways it's very similar to what Kopp, Schott and Cottrell said in terms of, well, you know, central planning really should take advantage of the new computational powers that came into being after World War II.
5890000	5894000	And so those are, it's important in that way.
5894000	5898000	I don't think it works as well as participatory planning.
5898000	5914000	One of the things that I'm constantly having to try and convince people who worry about participatory planning that it wouldn't be so burdensome for consumers to sit down.
5914000	5930000	And what I say is take the same number of hours it takes you to fill out your federal and state tax returns to at least put in some sort of, you know, rough proposal about what you want your consumption activity to look like in the next year.
5930000	5939000	He puts a much higher burden, you know, on people in terms of what information they have to convey.
5939000	5952000	So I think in that area, just in terms of practicality, and whether this is the kind of thing you could expect people to reasonably do, that he's demanding much more in that regard.
5952000	5961000	So if there's a problem with what I'm demanding in that regard in terms of whether people would be able to do it or happy to do it or unhappy doing it.
5961000	5970000	I think there's a much bigger problem from a practical point of view, you know, with his proposal in that regard.
5970000	5979000	The other part of the critique I have is it's more or less technical. I'm proud of the fact that our proposal will reach a feasible plan.
5979000	5986000	I'm pretty sure his won't. I mean, not a feasible plan, but an optimal or an efficient plan.
5986000	5990000	Economists use the word optimal. When they say optimal, they just mean efficient.
5990000	6001000	So I'm proud of the fact that I know that our proposal, that our planning process would be an efficient plan, and I'm pretty sure his wouldn't.
6001000	6005000	But that's kind of a technical issue.
6005000	6023000	Another place we're on the same grounds is his reaction to market socialists is, well, you're proposing market socialism because you claim it's impossible to do the planning.
6023000	6030000	I mean, you can't really do the detailed planning, but I'm showing you can. And so on that, we're really on the same wavelength.
6030000	6038000	We're both saying you can do planning and you can do planning in a participatory way.
6038000	6046000	Planning that bears no resemblance to the kind of central planning that was done in the Soviet type economies in the 20th century.
6046000	6055000	It's not, Ove was wrong when he said either markets or there's sort of central allocation, central planning.
6055000	6066000	There is no alternative. So I think Dan has proved that he was wrong because his proposal is sort of proof positive.
6066000	6075000	At least in theory, we could do this. And our proposal, I think, is also proof wrong because a different proposal says you can do it.
6075000	6083000	You can do something. You can coordinate a modern economy, you know, without either markets and without central planning.
6083000	6092000	So in that regard, I also think of it as an important contribution to people's thinking about all these things.
6092000	6100000	I will restrain myself not to get into the technical questions of your criticism because I'm actually also interested in those.
6100000	6107000	But I think these would really very much go too deep for the general audience. And so let's move on.
6107000	6118000	And I mean, I already said it, I'm very much appreciative of how Paragon is flexible, as you rightly pointed out, in certain regards,
6118000	6125000	specifically those which I had my troubles getting along with, as I already stated.
6125000	6132000	You know, I can make this, you know what? I'll make it very easy. I'm getting to be in a somewhat joking mood at the moment.
6132000	6143000	But, you know, I can promise you we will find a workers council whose system of evaluation you are comfortable with.
6143000	6152000	I can promise you that there will be many such councils that will handle that situation the way that you are comfortable with.
6152000	6154000	Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.
6154000	6159000	You know what? Let me make one further comment on this.
6159000	6169000	I think there's a similarity here. This analogy might sort of ring with people.
6169000	6183000	In any family, there are sort of disagreements and controversies, differences of opinion, and some families handle this by
6183000	6192000	We're not going to talk about it, because if we talk about it and we argue about it, we're just going to end up feeling worse.
6192000	6199000	So it's sort of the sweep it under the rug approach, you know, to family problems.
6199000	6204000	And then there are other families that basically take a very different tact.
6204000	6211000	They say, you know what? Sweeping it under the rug just makes it worse. It just festers.
6211000	6221000	It's better to just get it out there. And, you know, and I think in some sense, that's what we're talking about.
6221000	6232000	To what extent is it going to be helpful to sort of just live and let live?
6232000	6239000	And to what extent is it actually going to be more healthy?
6239000	6247000	Not to let resentment, so I don't think you're working as hard as I am, but you're getting paid as much.
6247000	6256000	Not to let resentments fester. To what extent is it going to just work out better?
6256000	6266000	If everybody agreed, I mean, if there were never any differences between self-evaluations and others evaluations, there would be no problem.
6266000	6272000	But it's important to realize in the real world that will not happen. In the real world, there will be disagreements.
6272000	6275000	And then it's a question of what's the best way to handle it.
6275000	6282000	And one way to handle it, I think, comes down to glossing over and just sort of ignoring.
6282000	6289000	And the other way of handling is, no, we're going to get up in each other's faces and have it out and then we'll all feel better afterwards.
6289000	6292000	Of course, the concern is maybe we won't feel better afterwards.
6292000	6297000	Maybe we'll actually really, you know, feel even worse about each other afterwards.
6297000	6303000	But I think that's I think essentially this is what we're sort of.
6303000	6309000	I guess I think this is what the discussion comes down to. I just wanted to throw that out there.
6309000	6330000	Well, I mean, this is kind of connected to the question that I wanted to pose, actually, because the way that you describe it already establishes a certain image of how people are and that they would, as you said before, at some point,
6330000	6343000	like you believe that the most of the people would react in ways in which they would get kind of angry if they had the feeling as if people who worked less than themselves would be paid the same.
6343000	6352000	And that you, as you just stated right now, think that it's better to address this resentment instead of glossing over it.
6352000	6358000	But this already operates on a level of assumptions that I maybe would not share.
6358000	6379000	Throughout reading Paracon and about the model, I had the feeling as if all of the aspects that I'm having trouble getting along with are in some way, shape or form connected to, I guess, some assumptions that that Paracon might share with,
6379000	6385000	I'd say, neoclassical economics and I would, or microeconomics to be specific.
6385000	6392000	So I would be interested in what is this connection and how do these assumptions inform Paracon?
6392000	6403000	Because, as I said, I had the feeling as if there was some type of, I would say, methodological individualism at play within how the model itself is structured.
6404000	6417000	And not only in terms of how you frame questions of efficiency or equity or fairness and stuff like that, but also on the level of how it is built.
6417000	6427000	So you build it kind of from the ground up, I would say, and the ground is some specific image of humans, so to speak.
6427000	6443000	And at some point in the book, I'm not sure, I guess, in the book or somewhere else, you quite clearly say that this nucleus, this image of how humans are being modeled on the ground of Paracon is actually the idea of homoeconomicus.
6443000	6450000	And that this is something that informs how this model is being built.
6450000	6470000	And I really had the strong sense that the elements with which I had a hard time agreeing and the fact that this type of modeling is somewhat close to how Paracon is being built, that this overlay is very informative.
6470000	6472000	I would be interested in this connection.
6472000	6476000	What is the connection between Paracon and neoclassical economics?
6476000	6483000	And why do you use some of these ideas and types of modeling?
6483000	6489000	Okay, I'm going to say a couple of things that sort of get at this.
6489000	6518000	Most people interpret when neoclassical economists model individual behavior as utility maximizing, most people interpret this as and most neoclassical economists themselves think of this as the only reasonable approximation we can make in theory to how people will behave.
6518000	6539000	That people have priorities and preferences and what they try to do is maximize their satisfaction, their enjoyment, given their preferences and given the opportunities available to them.
6539000	6559000	So most mainstream economists defend the use of the models of utility maximization as our best approach theoretically to predicting human behavior.
6559000	6573000	Now, if you then go and challenge a neoclassical economist and say, do you really think that that's a good predictor of people's behavior?
6573000	6579000	What the smart ones will say is, no.
6579000	6583000	Sometimes people don't behave that way.
6583000	6589000	They don't behave in their own self-interest, but that's the best we can do.
6589000	6598000	If we're trying to explain behavior and we start with the assumption that the behavior is irrational, well then we're not going to be able to explain it.
6598000	6604000	Now that's what a mainstream economist, I'm giving you the mainstream economist mindset.
6604000	6607000	Here's how my mindset differs from that.
6607000	6611000	First of all, I completely agree.
6611000	6615000	Sometimes people behave in their own self-interest and sometimes they don't.
6615000	6619000	I'm not interested in predicting how people will behave.
6619000	6625000	I'm interested in evaluating economic institutions.
6625000	6640000	So whether or not we can predict people, how good a job we can do in predicting how people behave by assuming that they will act in their rational self-interest given their preferences.
6640000	6645000	I'm not interested in that.
6645000	6653000	The answer might be we'll do a pretty good job of predicting behavior or it might be we'll do a pretty bad job of predicting behavior.
6653000	6662000	Certainly for some people we'll do a better job of predicting their behavior and for other people we'll do a terrible job of predicting their behavior if we do that.
6662000	6666000	But my job is not to predict people's behavior.
6666000	6671000	My job is to evaluate economic institutions.
6671000	6682000	And what economic institutions is, they promote some kinds of behavior and they discourage other kinds of behavior.
6682000	6694000	So if I'm going to evaluate an economic institution from the perspective of what kind of behavior does it promote, what kind of behavior does it discourage?
6694000	6707000	The only way I know how to answer that is what kind of behavior does the economic institution make rational for people to engage in?
6707000	6713000	So that's why I assume that people will behave rationally.
6713000	6717000	Not because I think they'll behave rationally.
6717000	6733000	But because the way that any social institution encourages some kinds of behavior and discourages other kinds of behavior is it encourages the behavior that it would be individually rational for people to engage in.
6733000	6741000	And it discourages or penalizes the behavior that would be irrational for people to engage in.
6741000	6744000	Now let me say one other thing.
6744000	6751000	So my goal is to evaluate the predictable effects of economic institutions.
6751000	6756000	Does it promote people, does it encourage people to behave in solidarity with one another?
6756000	6761000	Or does it discourage people from behaving in solidarity with one another?
6761000	6782000	I mean in the case of public goods, does it provide incentives for people to consume too little, choose to consume what we can demonstrably demonstrate is too little public goods?
6782000	6792000	So markets basically promote behavior because it's individually rational for everybody to demand too few public goods.
6792000	6800000	And therefore we will get an inefficient amount of public goods in market economies unless we have some other procedure for deciding how much there's going to be.
6800000	6803000	I'll give an example from centrally planning.
6803000	6818000	I think that the institution of central planning discourages people from trying to seek self-managed work opportunities.
6818000	6829000	It basically penalizes you if you try and seek that and it rewards you for not deciding you don't care.
6829000	6836000	So those are the reasons that I use what I constantly get criticizing for decades now.
6836000	6853000	I am criticized by many of my leftist colleagues as Robin you're always engaging in individualistic methodologies that are neoclassical.
6853000	6862000	I'm saying there's a certain part of what they do that's useful for us.
6862000	6865000	They misplay it.
6865000	6876000	They use it to answer a question that's actually rather boring, which is how much will people behave in their own self-interest and how much will they actually not?
6876000	6878000	And I already know the answer to that question.
6878000	6883000	The answer is sometimes they will, sometimes they won't, some people more, some people less.
6883000	6886000	There's nothing less that's interesting about that.
6886000	6901000	But if you want to know what kind of behavior an institution is going to promote, the only way to answer that is what kind of behavior would it make it rational for people to engage in and what kind of behavior would it make it irrational for people to behave in?
6901000	6908000	And I'm interested in judging institutions, not judging people in terms of how they behave or don't behave.
6908000	6925000	So now there's one other thing I'll add, and that is mainstream economists tell us we should just take we should just take people's preferences as given.
6925000	6935000	And this goes back to Jeremy Bentham, and it's sort of ours is not to reason why somebody likes something.
6935000	6942000	The job of an economist is to sort of you like what you like, you don't like what you don't like.
6942000	6945000	I do not stand in judgment of you.
6945000	6951000	I'm just supposed to be telling you whether we can give you whatever it is you want.
6951000	6954000	Are we doing a good job of helping you get it?
6954000	6958000	And neoclassical economists have taken that lesson.
6958000	6964000	I would say, you know, it's almost the bedrock that they stand on.
6964000	6967000	It's their Bible.
6967000	6972000	And there is something good to that Bible.
6972000	6986000	For instance, if the alternative is that Joseph Stalin is going to decide what the Russian people want, well, then I'd much rather go with Jeremy Bentham on that,
6986000	6990000	which is the Russian people want whatever they want.
6990000	6993000	Do not sit in judgment on that.
6993000	7001000	Do not say I, the revolutionary philosopher king, know better what people want than they know themselves.
7001000	7012000	So in that regard, you know, I think the tendency of the economics profession, you know, to abandon the whole notion
7012000	7021000	that there's somebody else who knows better what people should, what there's somebody else who knows better than people themselves
7021000	7027000	what it is that they should have and they should want and what will make them happy.
7027000	7029000	We really need to abandon that.
7029000	7033000	That should go into the dustbin of history.
7033000	7042000	However, isn't it obvious that people's preferences change over time?
7042000	7051000	And do you really think that people's preferences change over time randomly?
7051000	7054000	Here's what I think happens.
7054000	7060000	At any point in time, people have certain preferences and they'll act on them.
7060000	7065000	They'll act on them by choosing to work here and not there.
7065000	7070000	They'll act on them by choosing to buy this and not that.
7070000	7083000	Well, once they make those choices, today's preferences lead me to make choices.
7083000	7089000	When I make those choices, I consume certain things and I do certain work and I don't do other work.
7089000	7099000	Well, I have a model of human development that says you sort of start at birth, you have a genetic endowment,
7099000	7107000	and then in large part what you become through life is dependent on what activities you've engaged in.
7108000	7115000	So I'm going to engage in a whole bunch of activities over a 20-year time period.
7115000	7125000	Isn't it predictable that whatever activities I engage in are going to have some effect on what preferences I come to have at the end of the 20 years?
7125000	7131000	So here's the way I would put it.
7131000	7141000	When we make choices today, we satisfy our preferences more or less,
7141000	7151000	but we also, in some degree, sometimes we are transforming what I call our human characteristics.
7151000	7156000	We develop human characteristics over time.
7156000	7161000	And those human characteristics have an effect on our preferences.
7161000	7168000	So this is what I call a model of endogenous preferences or preference formation.
7168000	7175000	It says at any point in time, we have preferences based on whatever our human characteristics are.
7175000	7178000	We make our choices.
7178000	7181000	Two effects of the choices.
7181000	7186000	Given our characteristics, our choices more or less satisfied our preferences today.
7186000	7193000	But when we engage in the activity of those choices we've made,
7193000	7198000	we modify over time what our characteristics happen to be.
7198000	7203000	And when we have different characteristics two or three years down the road,
7203000	7210000	then we'll probably have some different preferences based on those different characteristics.
7210000	7223000	So one way I approach an economic institution is not only what behavior it makes rational for people to engage in,
7223000	7233000	when they engage in that behavior, will it have a predictable effect on what kinds of human characteristics they develop
7233000	7236000	and therefore what sort of preferences they'll have in the future.
7236000	7243000	So let me go back to the question of central planning and worker apathy.
7243000	7246000	So you put me in a centrally planned economy.
7246000	7256000	I very quickly discover that having any sort of preference over what we're going to produce, how we're going to do it, is totally pointless.
7256000	7259000	The institution discourages that.
7259000	7262000	There's no reward for that.
7262000	7271000	So I go ahead and I develop preferences that are rational in that context.
7271000	7277000	I develop characteristics where I'm pretty apathetic about work.
7277000	7280000	It was rational to do that.
7280000	7286000	But it's part of understanding what the problem with central planning is that that'll be the predictable effect.
7286000	7296000	So those are the ways in which I use what is highly criticized on the left as methodological individualism.
7296000	7301000	I don't use it as a predictor of actual human behavior.
7301000	7306000	Instead, I use it as a way to evaluate institutions.
7306000	7313000	And I also think that it's important for us to ask the question.
7313000	7326000	These institutions create certain biases in terms of how expensive certain things are going to be and how easy certain things are going to be to get.
7326000	7334000	And those biases have a predictable effect on what sort of characteristics of people are going to develop over time.
7334000	7341000	And I think that's even the most fundamental thing we want to ask ourselves about economic institutions.
7341000	7345000	Economic institutions are going to create certain kinds of people.
7345000	7352000	And in the end, we're going to have to sit there and ask ourselves, but were those the kinds of people we wanted to become?
7352000	7360000	So that's that's my long-winded answer on this subject.
7360000	7365000	My defense is mostly to feel aggrieved by my...
7365000	7371000	I feel aggrieved that most of my fellow leftists, I think, falsely accuse me.
7371000	7374000	Let me put it that way.
7374000	7381000	I'm in that position of feeling like the misunderstood child, you know, the child that feels like I'm so misunderstood.
7381000	7388000	And I feel on this subject, nine out of ten people who find themselves critical of me.
7388000	7391000	I feel like the aggrieved child who is misunderstood.
7391000	7394000	But that's not a defense.
7394000	7397000	Yeah, well, I'm not sure.
7397000	7404000	This would be, of course, very much interesting to find out whether or not I misunderstand you actually.
7404000	7411000	Because, I mean, maybe we can at least try to find it out.
7411000	7415000	Because, I mean, a couple of different things, I would say.
7415000	7419000	One of them would be that the way that you describe it,
7419000	7429000	even the endogenous preferences that actually take into account that preferences change over time,
7429000	7435000	even those when you describe them, you do acknowledge that people change.
7435000	7440000	You do acknowledge that they change through their actions in some way.
7440000	7450000	But what you do leave out is this huge area of what might call collective preference formation.
7450000	7460000	So it is not only me that is involved in forming my own preferences, neither in the here and now or over time.
7460000	7470000	So, and this is if you take this kind of thinking in terms of preferences and then look at the way paracorn is set up,
7470000	7475000	then I do see some analogy because you do have these worker councils
7475000	7481000	and they interact with each other on a higher level only through parametric mediation.
7481000	7486000	And from my perspective, one would say, all right,
7486000	7495000	it's nice and fine that worker councils within their internal structures are structured democratically and self-organized and stuff like that.
7495000	7503000	But the preference formation on a higher scale is always and needs to be also a political process,
7503000	7514000	not only a communication, but a very much political process because this aspect of collective preference formation needs to be that, exactly that, collective.
7514000	7521000	But through modeling these actions in paracorn in the way that you do,
7521000	7532000	you will necessarily lead yourself into a position where you can only argue for workers councils acting with each other on a parametric level
7532000	7538000	because you do not want to interfere with the, so to speak, personal integrity of the workers councils.
7538000	7540000	So there you have this analogy.
7540000	7544000	And this is interesting to me how one relates to the other
7544000	7550000	and how I would argue both on the individual level as well as on the societal level
7550000	7556000	for an aspect which I would then call maybe collective preference formation,
7556000	7564000	which would always entail certain political aspect and political mechanisms
7564000	7573000	that are not addressed sufficiently through, for example, mere parametric mediation, I would say.
7573000	7575000	I hope I'm a bit clear.
7575000	7578000	I think I hear you.
7578000	7585000	I mean, one thing I would say is that there's actually a difference of opinion between Michael Albert and me on this subject.
7585000	7596000	Michael would accuse me of saying, Robin, you want things just to be decided, as you put it, parametrically.
7596000	7602000	And that doesn't provide enough interpersonal communication.
7602000	7612000	And interpersonal communication is both an information sharing and a learning process.
7612000	7625000	And my reaction back to him is not everybody wants to sit in meetings all day arguing with you, Michael.
7625000	7638000	And so there is a tension on this subject, even amongst those of us who advocate for a participatory economy.
7638000	7641000	Here's a second thing I'll say.
7641000	7651000	And I've said this to Michael also, which is, hey, anytime people want to have meetings and talk, I don't care.
7651000	7655000	People should have meetings and talk as much as they want.
7655000	7658000	So you can add as much inter-community.
7658000	7677000	Another way of thinking of it is, in my view, you can add as much interpersonal communication where people are sharing information and trying to come to an understanding of one another,
7677000	7682000	which is always, in some sense, search for, can we find more common ground?
7682000	7685000	Can we find consensus?
7685000	7690000	I'm not ever opposed to as much of that as anybody wants to engage in.
7690000	7705000	On the other hand, I don't want to design a system that can't work reasonably
7705000	7728000	and come to decisions in a timely way and that don't allow people to choose how much of that further discussion and communication to engage in.
7728000	7737000	And I'm also concerned that, here's again, I think there's a bias, if you take a look at progressives and leftists and socialists,
7737000	7748000	and then you look at the entire population, how much time the typical leftist wants to spend in meetings and discussions and argumentation,
7748000	7757000	compared to what a normal person is willing to put up with, normal people are ready to go fishing after an hour.
7757000	7760000	And most leftist will stay till two in the morning.
7760000	7776000	So I worry about designing a system that fits our preferences, but predictably not the preferences of a lot of other people who just aren't like us in that way.
7776000	7790000	So I am constantly looking for ways to get things done more quickly with less discussion.
7790000	7806000	I'm also looking for ways where whatever discussion goes on, there's an agenda for the discussion that somehow has a logic to it that doesn't just end us up with,
7806000	7818000	will you think this and I think that, or you feel this and I feel that, because those kinds of discussions can go on until the cows come home.
7818000	7830000	And particularly if you set up a decision making process where the decision is going to be made by whoever stays latest in the morning,
7830000	7841000	then that I really have a serious objection to. Then that one is where I'm going to stand up on my hind legs and say, no, no, no, no, there's a serious flaw there.
7841000	7845000	So those are just some thoughts on this subject.
7845000	7867000	I think there's a huge difference between our proposals about annual participatory planning in terms of how much information sharing, debate and argumentation has to go on and our proposals about investment and long term development planning.
7867000	7885000	That, although again, even in that regard, where we concentrate on is trying to identify who would have best access to information and how would they be motivated in terms of empowering them to make estimates of things that are used to draw up a plan
7885000	7896000	and involving people at the point where they have to decide the major things like just how much difference between consumption of average consumption over time.
7896000	7910000	Are we willing to tolerate the generational equity constraint and involving people with after we've got the most credible estimates of various things that are important to calculate,
7910000	7916000	what an efficient investment plan or plan over time would be.
7916000	7927000	Then I want political bodies to sit down and look at that and debate that and discuss that political bodies and eventually vote on it through legislatures or referendum.
7927000	7932000	So there's a huge difference in terms of how these development and investment plans.
7932000	7940000	We are proposing now and I've already said that that's more provisional parts of our proposals.
7940000	7950000	So I do think and we have clashed with people such as yourself over the past in this particular area.
7950000	7954000	The clash is greatest about the annual planning.
7954000	7969000	And in some ways, I think that we are more on the same wavelength and some of the sort of nagging doubts about whether this is really the process you really think is the best process.
7969000	7985000	I think that what we've now proposed about the investment and the development planning in some sense diminishes the difference between us, this sort of traditional difference between us.
7985000	7993000	Absolutely. And if you would not have said that, that was the other thing that I just wanted to add.
7993000	8008000	I think that this is a very important remark and that through these aspects of long-term planning and so forth, I think there are very important aspects being included into Paragon.
8008000	8023000	I think what I would suggest is that what I would suggest is to people like yourself, and you already have, but to other people like yourself, look at those and see whether they don't assuage one's fears in this regard to some extent, at least.
8023000	8039000	And just to get that right, I mean, in the traditional Paragon model, there was no additional political structure that accompanied a Paragon economy, is it?
8039000	8050000	There was only the model of the different elements that you sketched. There was no additional political institutional framework, no?
8050000	8076000	If you go back to our actual overall methodology, we talk about four spheres of social life, the economic sphere, the kinship sphere, which is basically gender relations and reproduction, what we call the community sphere of social life, and then the political sphere of social life.
8076000	8083000	And so participatory economics was originally really only a proposal about the economic sphere.
8083000	8096000	And without saying it was the be-all and the end-all, without saying it was necessarily more important than the political sphere or the kinship sphere or the community sphere.
8096000	8109000	And community, what we mean is historically defined communities via race or ethnicity or religion. That's what we mean by community. I don't mean community as in neighborhood.
8109000	8125000	So what's happened is now for the first time, we've sort of made some proposals about reproductive labor after very, very self-consciously not doing anything about that for a while.
8125000	8144000	And not me, but somebody named Steve Schallem has made some very specific proposals about the political sphere, which since participatory economy was called per econ, that got called per polity.
8144000	8157000	And I have not been very involved in that. I mean, I did get involved in sort of as one of the people working on the reproductive labor or reproductive activity.
8157000	8172000	I've been uninvolved really, you know, with trying to think through proposals about how the political system should work as being quite distinct from representational democracy.
8172000	8183000	And so I would recommend, I mean, what I can do in that regard is simply recommend what Steve Schallem has written on that subject.
8183000	8189000	There's also somewhat of a division in terms of websites out there for where you can find it and where you can't.
8189000	8201000	So on the www.participatoryeconomy.org website, there really isn't any material there about her polity.
8201000	8212000	Whereas if you go to the real utopia website, they feature, I mean, there's more material on the participatory economy,
8212000	8221000	but they certainly have a lot of the material up there about, you know, Steve's proposals that are in some way.
8221000	8235000	I mean, the way I would characterize them is people find our participatory economy proposals sort of in some ways outside the mainstream, even on the left.
8236000	8243000	And I think in some way, and so they're sort of bold and innovative in that sense.
8243000	8249000	I'm trying to now, I'm not trying to sell them as, well, they're bold and innovative, but they make all the sense in the world.
8249000	8253000	They're going to become majoritarian within two decades.
8254000	8259000	I also think is some very bold and innovative recommendations.
8259000	8266000	And what it's an attempt to deal with is the even in representative democracy.
8266000	8271000	The average person just feels like this has nothing to do with me.
8271000	8275000	And so I think that's that's the dilemma.
8275000	8282000	That's the problem that Steve and others who've worked on on on pair polity.
8282000	8284000	That's their starting point.
8284000	8297000	And they're basically asking, can we can we propose something that's rather dramatically different from what people most people are, you know, even have heard of or even thought about to address that issue.
8297000	8301000	And in that regard, I think that's a very, very worthy task.
8301000	8308000	But I just am not personally able to speak to it in any kind of in any sort of detailed way.
8309000	8313000	Robin, there's a last question I ask all of my guests.
8313000	8318000	And it is if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
8320000	8323000	I find the human species interesting still.
8323000	8326000	I find the human species interesting.
8327000	8339000	And I do not, despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic that we may just figure things out.
8340000	8342000	Fantastic, Robin.
