Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and my guest today is Daniel E. Sarrows,

00:06.960 --> 00:12.080
with whom I will be talking about digital socialism and the abolition of capital.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.560
Before we get to the interview, I'd like to say a few words on this.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.640
What you are about to hear is an in-depth discussion of Daniel Sarrows' proposal of

00:22.640 --> 00:28.800
a socialist political economy with its own socialist laws of motion and a socialist mode

00:28.800 --> 00:35.680
of production. More than anything, this is an invitation to everybody out there longing for

00:35.680 --> 00:42.400
fundamentally different political economies to please join the discussion. And if I say everybody,

00:42.400 --> 00:47.680
I do mean everybody and specifically people coming from other traditions of thought and

00:47.680 --> 00:53.760
political orientation. I'm really honestly interested in your opinion on that. This whole

00:53.760 --> 00:58.880
thing here is meant to be an open and honest investigation of how fundamentally different

00:58.880 --> 01:04.720
kinds of futures can be brought about. And I do believe that Dan's work is an important

01:04.720 --> 01:10.880
contribution to this. Since he dares to do what many shy away from, he puts out a concrete

01:10.880 --> 01:17.200
proposal. Such a proposal can only be seen as a starting point, of course, and I can't stress

01:17.200 --> 01:24.000
this enough. This is a wholehearted invitation to engage with these ideas. I put an extra effort

01:24.000 --> 01:29.360
in creating the show notes for this episode, so you'll find a lot of resources for further

01:29.360 --> 01:35.920
engagement with the topic there. We will cover the proposal as well as its historical foundations

01:35.920 --> 01:42.960
in great detail, so much so that I had to split the three-hour interview into two episodes.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.960
The second part will be released in episode 32 of Future Histories in two weeks time.

01:49.600 --> 01:55.440
Patreon supporters, however, can listen to it already starting today. So if you are super

01:55.440 --> 02:01.440
fixed by what you hear today and can't stand waiting another two weeks, every support on

02:01.440 --> 02:09.520
Patreon is greatly appreciated. But now please enjoy today's episode with Daniel Seros on

02:09.520 --> 02:13.200
digital socialism and the abolition of capital.

02:19.200 --> 02:25.840
Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and my guest today is Daniel E. Seros. Daniel is

02:25.840 --> 02:32.000
a professor of economics at Valparaiso University and author of the book Information Technology

02:32.000 --> 02:37.760
and Socialist Construction, The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism, which we will

02:37.760 --> 02:44.320
discuss at length in today's episode. Welcome, Daniel. Thank you. It's great to be here. Great

02:44.320 --> 02:50.000
to have you. First of all, thank you, Daniel, not only for taking the time for this interview, but

02:50.000 --> 02:55.840
also for writing this book. I think it's really of vital importance that we develop very concrete

02:55.840 --> 03:04.160
proposals for alternative political economies, yet many shy away from exactly that and end up in

03:04.160 --> 03:10.240
vague appeals to solidarity that might be more immune to criticism, but at the same time,

03:10.240 --> 03:16.240
they do not provide answers to the crucial question of how exactly an alternative to

03:16.240 --> 03:21.920
the capitalist mode of production should be organized. So I was delighted to read your

03:21.920 --> 03:27.680
very concrete proposal, which addresses basic questions of political economy and its mode of

03:27.680 --> 03:35.920
production head on. What is it that you aimed for with your book? Well, ever since I was a graduate

03:35.920 --> 03:42.480
student at the University of Notre Dame, I've been studying Marxian economics. And around 2008,

03:42.480 --> 03:48.560
it became clear to me that I could not continue working in this tradition unless I answered the

03:48.560 --> 03:54.640
question for myself, just how the socialist mode of production would operate. So it's really not

03:54.640 --> 04:01.040
enough to criticize capitalism. One must have something concrete to offer in its place.

04:01.760 --> 04:09.760
And so I began working on that question. And it became clear to me that a socialist society

04:09.760 --> 04:14.480
would need to find an alternative movement that could replace the movement of capital,

04:14.480 --> 04:20.800
as Marx described it in volume one of capital. So it would need to have its own logic, its own

04:20.800 --> 04:27.440
dynamic that would be self-sustaining and allow for the continued development of

04:27.440 --> 04:34.000
society's productive forces. So most importantly, it would need to eliminate the exploitation of

04:34.000 --> 04:37.840
labor power, which is the defining feature of the capitalist mode of production.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.440
So I think we need an entirely new method of economic organization.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.480
We don't want to simply focus on interventions within the capitalist system, such as minimum wage

04:50.480 --> 04:57.600
laws and Keynesian macroeconomic management. As much as those kinds of interventions might be

04:57.600 --> 05:05.280
important in a capitalist society to achieve equity, economic stabilization, what we need

05:05.280 --> 05:11.360
is a full-blown alternative that can really stand on its own. And even though it will emerge from

05:11.360 --> 05:18.720
capitalist society, it's going to be something entirely different. And in order to build a

05:18.720 --> 05:25.360
sketch of how this could look like, your book has four parts. First, the logic of capital,

05:25.360 --> 05:31.600
second, the defense of capital, third, the renewed challenge to capital and fourth,

05:31.600 --> 05:38.080
the end of capital. These are all very much relevant for the investigations of this podcast.

05:38.080 --> 05:44.880
So please let's take a look at each of them. In part one, you first describe the capitalist

05:44.880 --> 05:51.280
laws of motion. You then argue that while Marx did indeed provide an analysis of the capitalist

05:51.280 --> 05:58.240
mode of production, he did not provide a concrete answer or idea of what socialism would actually

05:58.240 --> 06:04.080
look like and how it would be organized in practical terms. First things first, what is

06:04.080 --> 06:09.200
the logic of capital and what does it mean to abolish capital as such?

06:09.200 --> 06:15.840
Well, I think to understand the logic of capital, you really need to read volume one of Marx's

06:15.840 --> 06:22.160
capital. There's no substitute for it. It's very difficult to read the first time, especially part

06:22.160 --> 06:29.600
one on commodities and money, but it's worth the effort. And so capital obeys certain rules or laws

06:29.600 --> 06:36.160
of motion. And that is what I mean when I refer to its logic. So Marx describes how commodity

06:36.160 --> 06:42.640
exchange within capitalist economies can be represented symbolically as CMC prime.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.840
So that is commodities are sold for money and then they're used to purchase other commodities.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.040
This is the sphere of circulation where Adam Smith's invisible hand operates.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.880
People pursue their own self-interest and they exchange their property for the property of

06:58.880 --> 07:04.160
another person. And then that leaves both sides to the exchange better off than previously.

07:05.120 --> 07:10.400
At the same time, Marx identified another movement that can be easily overlooked.

07:11.600 --> 07:18.880
And this movement is capital and is symbolically represented as MCM prime. So in that case,

07:18.880 --> 07:24.240
money is used to buy commodities and then the commodities are sold for a larger sum of money.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.920
And the difference is surplus value, the difference between the amount of money initially

07:29.920 --> 07:35.600
spent and the amount that's realized at the end. That difference is surplus value.

07:35.600 --> 07:41.600
So it's realization and appropriation or what motivates capitalists to set capital in motion.

07:43.040 --> 07:48.240
So how is this surplus value possible? Well, Marx argued that there is a special commodity

07:48.240 --> 07:54.480
that's available in the marketplace in capitalist societies. And this is the commodity labor power,

07:54.480 --> 08:01.120
which is the capacity to work during a specific period of time. So it's sold as a commodity

08:01.120 --> 08:06.800
in the marketplace. And it has this special property that when it's consumed, it actually

08:06.800 --> 08:13.280
creates new value since human labor is the source of value. So the really amazing feature of this

08:13.280 --> 08:20.960
commodity labor power is that its value depends on the values of the commodities that the worker

08:20.960 --> 08:27.920
needs to live and work. But its value creating power is actually larger. So during the course

08:27.920 --> 08:34.480
of a working day, a worker will create new value equivalent to what they need to live and work.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.160
But then because they work during the entire working day, they create value in excess of that.

08:40.160 --> 08:47.360
And that surplus value is what motivates capitalists to pursue capitalist production.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.400
So the basic movement that I just described has been this driving force throughout the history of

08:52.400 --> 08:59.040
global capitalism. And this accumulation of capital has really revolutionized the means

08:59.040 --> 09:06.400
of production and created this world that we have today. So to come back to your question,

09:06.400 --> 09:12.640
what does it mean to abolish capital? It means to bring an end to this economic category,

09:12.640 --> 09:19.120
as Marx defined it. And so we want to identify an alternative movement that can positively

09:19.840 --> 09:26.240
develop society's productive forces and better serve human needs. So it is possible, of course,

09:26.240 --> 09:32.240
to abolish capital and destroy human civilization. But that's obviously not what most of us want.

09:32.240 --> 09:37.520
And so what we want is a positive substitute for this thing that Marx called capital.

09:37.520 --> 09:45.600
Well, you're right that it is important for us to, and I quote here, recognize the crucial point

09:45.600 --> 09:51.840
that even if everyone on the planet adopted Marxism, socialism would not be possible unless

09:51.840 --> 09:57.600
certain objective conditions were met. What these conditions are is the key question that

09:57.600 --> 10:04.480
must be answered. And on this question, Marx and Engels had precious little to say. According to

10:04.480 --> 10:10.560
your book, there is a silence both about these objective conditions for socialism as well as on

10:10.560 --> 10:16.960
the question of how a socialist political economy would be organized in practical terms. You call

10:16.960 --> 10:25.040
this the great silence. Could you maybe explain this a bit to us? Sure. I argue in the book that

10:25.040 --> 10:30.320
there are really two essential conditions that must be met for socialism to be possible.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.720
So the first is what I'm referring to as the acquisition of social consciousness

10:34.720 --> 10:40.080
throughout the human population. So this means that we need to become conscious of the fact that

10:40.080 --> 10:45.920
we are members of the human species and that we work together to achieve some sort of balance

10:45.920 --> 10:51.280
between our productive activities and the natural environment. And furthermore, we must recognize

10:51.280 --> 10:57.920
capitalism involves a conflict between social classes and that will never achieve this balance

10:57.920 --> 11:02.880
as long as this conflict continues. So one condition then is that we become conscious

11:02.880 --> 11:08.880
of these things. The problem, however, is that even if we all become committed Marxists and

11:08.880 --> 11:13.920
acquired this species consciousness, it would still not be sufficient to alter the mode of

11:13.920 --> 11:20.880
production, I argue, because certain objective conditions must also be met. So specifically,

11:20.880 --> 11:26.480
our productive forces must be sufficient to produce an abundance of use values for consumption.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.800
That is a condition that socialists, I think, have long recognized that we'd be able to produce a

11:32.800 --> 11:41.120
huge abundance of use values of material wealth. Without this ability, we would enter into conflict

11:41.120 --> 11:46.400
with one another over what is available. We would also not produce enough beyond what's needed to

11:46.400 --> 11:51.840
satisfy our basic needs to then further develop the social forces of production. So in other words,

11:51.840 --> 11:59.680
it wouldn't be anything left for investment. So more is needed then. And what we also need is to

11:59.680 --> 12:06.640
be able to communicate our needs to each other in a way that is conscious and planned and then use

12:06.640 --> 12:13.360
that information to efficiently allocate resources to produce what we need. So socialists have long

12:13.360 --> 12:20.640
argued that the ability to produce an abundance of use values is a key requirement for socialism

12:20.640 --> 12:27.600
to be established. But again, this emphasis on the communication of social needs has been given

12:27.600 --> 12:33.760
less attention, I think. So I argue that Marx and Engels did not specify these conditions clearly,

12:34.320 --> 12:41.440
and they argued instead that speculation about the socialist future was a utopian exercise.

12:42.720 --> 12:47.200
They had really very little to say about the subject of socialism, especially in comparison

12:47.200 --> 12:52.480
with how much they wrote about capitalism. And I think this silence on the question,

12:52.480 --> 12:58.080
it appears as a contradiction in Marx's worldview. And this is something I bring up in the introduction

12:58.080 --> 13:04.480
to the book. That is, the proletariat is supposed to consciously establish socialism,

13:05.360 --> 13:12.960
and yet we cannot describe what socialism is in any detail. And there seems to be a conflict there.

13:12.960 --> 13:20.720
So really, the whole book, I would say, is about trying to resolve this apparent contradiction.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.880
How could Marx hold both views simultaneously that we're supposed to consciously bring about

13:26.880 --> 13:33.840
socialism, but at the same time, we should not describe how it is to function in any detail?

13:33.840 --> 13:40.000
That seems contradictory. So really, to resolve this contradiction,

13:40.960 --> 13:46.320
I think what we need to do is recognize that Marx's vision was limited due to the insufficient

13:46.320 --> 13:52.240
development of society's productive forces or its technological capability. In other words,

13:52.240 --> 13:59.440
modern information technology was not available or even conceivable in Marx's time. And so I argue

13:59.440 --> 14:04.480
that this modern information technology is one of the essential objective conditions that must be

14:04.480 --> 14:10.640
in place for the socialist mode of production to be possible. So whereas it was once utopian

14:10.640 --> 14:16.960
to describe how socialism would function, it's really no longer utopian because we possess the

14:16.960 --> 14:23.040
means now to make it a reality. So I think Marx was really honest in that he didn't offer a false

14:23.040 --> 14:29.360
solution, but only identified the features of what he called the lower and higher phases of communism

14:29.360 --> 14:35.520
that could be only perfectly described at that moment in history. So this seems to me to be the

14:35.520 --> 14:41.040
only way to really resolve this apparent contradiction in Marx's thought unless we just

14:41.840 --> 14:47.840
accept the view that there is no alternative to capitalism and that Marx was simply wrong in what

14:47.840 --> 14:58.480
he wrote. And isn't it a classical retreat to say, oh well, no, he didn't specify it in that much

14:58.480 --> 15:04.480
detail because this would have been a kind of, I don't know, paternalistic act where you have

15:04.480 --> 15:11.040
this blueprint of the future and that instead it should kind of organically evolve out of the

15:11.040 --> 15:18.800
movement itself and that anything else would be some kind of authoritarian act somehow?

15:19.520 --> 15:25.440
I think that's a good point. And one could maybe argue that that's another way to resolve the

15:25.440 --> 15:34.720
paradox, that Marx didn't want to establish the blueprint and as you put it, in a paternalistic

15:34.720 --> 15:40.640
manner, tell the working class what it should be doing. You certainly can take that position.

15:42.000 --> 15:51.760
But it seems to me that that leaves the questions just so open-ended and with so much disagreement

15:51.760 --> 15:58.640
about what to do. It's hard to imagine the working class ever, and maybe that's part of the problem

15:58.640 --> 16:07.920
is that there needs to be unity among the workers as they pursue this. If there's such widespread

16:07.920 --> 16:13.440
disagreement within the working class, how could they ever transform the mode of production

16:13.440 --> 16:20.960
completely? So I think that may be a potential problem with that way of resolving the paradox.

16:21.280 --> 16:27.440
One certainly could try to do it that way. I totally agree with you, actually, because

16:27.440 --> 16:37.680
I also believe that it is necessary to have this imaginary of a different kind of future.

16:37.680 --> 16:44.720
And also, I think the point is quite valid that this imaginary future should not be

16:45.520 --> 16:54.640
utopian in essence, in the sense that the basis for its realization is actually not

16:54.640 --> 17:02.320
existent. So I like your point or your twist that you're saying, all right, we need this image

17:02.960 --> 17:10.480
and we do have the means of production now to make it possible. That's kind of the punchline

17:10.480 --> 17:17.920
that I got from your book and I really enjoyed it, actually. Thank you. Okay, so now let's get

17:17.920 --> 17:25.600
to the juicy stuff. Let's get to the socialist calculation debate. You have a long chapter

17:26.240 --> 17:32.960
on this topic and I very much enjoyed this chapter as well. Throughout the first half of the 20th

17:32.960 --> 17:38.400
century, there has been quite an argument about the question of whether or not an autonomous

17:38.400 --> 17:45.120
socialist mode of economic calculation is possible or not. This has been labeled the

17:45.120 --> 17:51.840
socialist calculation debate. What were, from your perspective, the key arguments within the debate?

17:51.840 --> 17:58.880
Who were the participants and what can we learn from it? Well, this debate took place primarily

17:58.880 --> 18:06.400
between market socialists like Oskar Lange and H. D. Dickinson and Austrian economists such as Ludwig

18:06.400 --> 18:13.440
von Mises and F. A. Hayek. I give much credit to Mises in the book for arguing that socialists

18:13.440 --> 18:19.600
lack a method of economic calculation. In his view, without competitive markets, it would not

18:19.600 --> 18:25.920
be possible to have a rational economic system. That is, without market prices, we are left

18:25.920 --> 18:31.280
fumbling around in the dark without a rational guide for our decision-making processes.

18:32.080 --> 18:37.280
This point was very important and I believe it is what Hayek referred to as the unseen problem

18:37.280 --> 18:42.800
facing socialist alternatives. This fumbling in the dark, of course, opens the door to the use

18:42.800 --> 18:48.640
of coercion or a command system which many socialists rejected at the time and even more

18:48.640 --> 18:56.880
reject the use of command now. Mises thought it was logically impossible to solve the problem

18:56.880 --> 19:02.720
any other way than through voluntary exchange. Hayek found it to be logically possible to solve

19:02.720 --> 19:07.920
the problem, but the information processing requirements were so massive that it could not

19:07.920 --> 19:14.400
be solved in a practical sense. It was also not possible to even acquire as much information as

19:14.400 --> 19:19.440
would be needed in his view. Market socialists, on the other hand, wanted to have some form of

19:19.440 --> 19:23.760
socially owned property while relying on the competitive market to allocate resources.

19:24.560 --> 19:30.960
So some economists argued that the problem of market socialism could be resolved in a variety

19:30.960 --> 19:38.160
of ways. One of the early papers by Enrico Barone described a trial and error method of solving the

19:38.160 --> 19:43.920
problem so we could adjust prices. A central authority could adjust prices in the face of

19:43.920 --> 19:50.400
surpluses and shortages and in that way commodity markets could be cleared. The same method could

19:50.400 --> 19:55.440
be used to clear the money capital market. Hayek rejected this solution on the grounds that

19:55.440 --> 20:00.640
competition could lead to more rapid price adjustments than a central planner could achieve.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.920
H.D. Dickinson argued that an elite planning body could estimate supply and demand equations

20:07.920 --> 20:13.120
and then solve a system of simultaneous equations to determine the optimal market clearing prices.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.880
So I want to make a couple points here. That's kind of an overview of the debate as I understand

20:20.880 --> 20:26.960
it. But first I want to say that I interpret the socialist calculation debate as stemming from the

20:26.960 --> 20:32.400
same problem that Marx and Engels encountered and thus why they did not say more about the socialist

20:32.400 --> 20:39.760
future. So that is Marx and Engels hesitated to describe the future socialist society because they

20:39.760 --> 20:45.680
lacked the means to do so and only modern information technology allows for this socialist

20:45.680 --> 20:54.720
calculation problem to be solved. So the debate, I argue, stemmed from the combination of Marx's

20:54.720 --> 21:00.880
superior theory of capitalism but his inability due to historical constraints to describe how

21:00.880 --> 21:06.800
the problem would be solved. So it's understandable then that there would have been such a lengthy

21:06.800 --> 21:13.840
debate in the early 20th century about how to resolve this problem. And second, if socialists

21:14.640 --> 21:20.880
have adopted Marx's theory of capital, why are they striving to achieve the ideals of perfect

21:20.880 --> 21:27.200
competition as neoclassical economists define them? If neoclassical economists possess a flawed theory

21:27.200 --> 21:33.200
of how capitalism functions by, for example, omitting class exploitation, then why would you

21:33.200 --> 21:38.720
strive to achieve their efficiency results? Schubert, for example, was very critical of

21:39.360 --> 21:46.800
market socialists for choosing this path and I agree that this is kind of an odd way to try

21:46.800 --> 21:52.480
to solve the problem. Why would you build on a theory you disagree with in an effort to resolve

21:53.440 --> 22:00.880
a problem with your own theory? I'd actually make a really bold claim and that listeners might

22:00.880 --> 22:07.760
not agree with. But I would argue that both sides in that debate were interested in it because both

22:07.760 --> 22:13.200
actually wanted to know if a solution exists. Market socialists favored Marx's theory and they

22:13.200 --> 22:20.160
were eager to put forward a solution. Austrian economists, I would argue, also they recognized

22:20.160 --> 22:26.160
the problem and they were interested in whether there was a solution but they were skeptical that

22:26.160 --> 22:31.440
a solution would be found. And so even though I think Austrian economists recognized the strength

22:31.440 --> 22:38.800
of Marx's theory but they didn't want to publicly acknowledge it, which would certainly be a

22:38.800 --> 22:45.840
controversial claim for some, I include some references to Hayek's statements in my book

22:45.840 --> 22:53.840
where it suggests that he at some point tried to kind of pull back from some of those views

22:53.840 --> 23:00.720
because he didn't feel there was a resolution to these problems. So I think mainly that's what

23:00.720 --> 23:08.160
I think we can learn from it. And just out of curiosity, I really liked it that at some point

23:08.160 --> 23:14.560
in your book you point towards the need to look at the base of the argument and as you already

23:14.560 --> 23:21.280
explained right now, you think that Marx did a proper analysis of the capitalist mode of production

23:21.280 --> 23:26.400
but did not provide an alternative to the question of economic calculation and then Hayek,

23:26.400 --> 23:33.200
on the other side, cleverly uses this omission as the base layer of his argument while at the same

23:33.200 --> 23:39.120
time not providing a proper alternative analysis of the capitalist mode of production. But this

23:39.120 --> 23:44.720
still leaves open the question if there has been an attempt to fill Hayek's omission and develop

23:44.720 --> 23:50.800
an Austrian analysis of the capitalist mode of production. I don't know if anybody did this,

23:50.800 --> 24:00.160
maybe Rothbard or anything, because if you say that they saw what Marx did right and they had

24:00.160 --> 24:05.120
a valid point in the question of economic calculation, then they must have had the

24:06.160 --> 24:14.560
urge to make it complete, to come up with their own idea of how to interpret the capitalist mode

24:14.560 --> 24:21.920
of production. Yes, and I think the roots of Austrian economics go back to the late 19th

24:21.920 --> 24:27.680
century, the work of Karl Menger, and they do possess a theory of capitalism. But I would

24:27.680 --> 24:33.600
argue it's inferior to Marx's theory because like neoclassical economics, it avoids class conflict

24:34.160 --> 24:38.800
and so it really has less to work with in its analysis of capitalism and that's really at the

24:38.800 --> 24:46.400
root of its inferior nature relative to Marx's theory. However, it has much to say about

24:46.400 --> 24:51.440
monopolistic firms and their behavior, capital theory, the theory of the business cycle.

24:52.400 --> 24:57.440
My textbook actually, which is available online for free, includes quite a bit of this material.

24:58.080 --> 25:03.680
It's available at principlesofpoliticaleconomy.pressbooks.com for anyone who's interested

25:04.320 --> 25:09.760
in looking at it. So Roger Garrison, actually an Austrian economist, gave me permission to

25:09.760 --> 25:15.200
summarize in my textbook his diagrammatic representation of Austrian macroeconomic theory

25:15.760 --> 25:20.720
and I also include Rothbard's discussion of an Austrian measurement of the money supply.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.840
So even though I ultimately favor Marx's theory, I do respect

25:24.640 --> 25:28.800
theories that have been developed within other schools of thought, including the Austrian school.

25:29.760 --> 25:35.360
That's nice because I think it had some... When I was reading your book,

25:35.360 --> 25:41.760
I had the sense of intellectual honesty somehow. So I think it's important to engage

25:41.760 --> 25:48.480
in the arguments of the different fashions. I don't want to say the other side because

25:48.480 --> 25:55.840
that would be too dualistic, but I very much enjoyed that you obviously take this serious,

25:56.800 --> 26:03.440
the argument of the Austrians. And there would be a second question relating to that.

26:04.080 --> 26:08.480
And that is actually going into the other direction, not in the direction of how to

26:09.280 --> 26:17.040
complete the theory by providing an autonomous interpretation of the capitalist mode of

26:17.040 --> 26:23.200
production. But if Hayek... Because I was then looking at Wikipedia, when did he die?

26:24.160 --> 26:33.440
He died in 1992. So he must have experienced the advent of computer technology. And if it was,

26:33.440 --> 26:41.200
as you said, that he at some point kind of opened this loophole that there might be a way to

26:42.960 --> 26:48.560
provide a different type of economic calculation, but that it is just not discovered yet, then he

26:48.560 --> 26:54.880
actually must have considered computers and information technology at some point. Did he

26:54.880 --> 27:00.480
write about it or are there some public statements about this? Yeah, you've asked an interesting

27:00.480 --> 27:06.080
question here. And I have to confess. I mean, the truth is, I don't know for sure. I'm really not

27:06.080 --> 27:11.040
an expert on all of Hayek's work. My interest was in the factors that influenced the debate in the

27:11.040 --> 27:17.680
1920s and the 1930s. And I do regard it as an error to think that computer solving systems of

27:17.680 --> 27:23.040
demand and supply equations could bring about socialism. The kind of solution that I propose

27:23.040 --> 27:28.240
really relies on information technology, but in a very different way. And I don't think that this

27:28.240 --> 27:36.000
use of computer technology could have been imagined in the early 1990s, much less in the 1930s.

27:37.760 --> 27:45.040
So my suspicion is that Hayek would have thought that the problem of acquiring

27:45.040 --> 27:50.560
so much information and processing it would still remain, even with the kind of computer

27:50.560 --> 27:58.160
technology we have in the 21st century. But, and I guess here's coming back to my punchline,

27:58.720 --> 28:09.360
I think that the kind of system that I have proposed is not one that any of the contributors

28:09.360 --> 28:15.840
to this debate had in mind at all. It's completely different from what they were

28:15.840 --> 28:21.040
talking about or even how they were imagining how computers might be used in the future.

28:22.000 --> 28:31.200
So I think that's probably what sets my proposal apart. And yeah, but as far as whether Hayek

28:31.200 --> 28:38.400
actually commented on that question, I really don't know. When it comes to popular positions

28:39.040 --> 28:43.920
that defend capitalism, you pick them. For me, curious candidate, Iain Rand,

28:44.560 --> 28:50.720
you picked her as your sparring partner. This came somewhat of a surprise to me because I knew

28:50.720 --> 28:56.480
about her influence on the early Silicon Valley elite. And I have seen a documentary by Adam

28:56.480 --> 29:02.720
Curtis, where her philosophy is explained as well as her influence on, for example, Alan Greenspan,

29:02.960 --> 29:10.560
the former head of the Federal Reserve. Yet I always thought of her more as a pop cultural

29:10.560 --> 29:16.960
phenomenon or even a sectarian, actually, to be honest, than a serious thinker. Could you

29:16.960 --> 29:22.240
introduce our listeners to her philosophy and maybe explain a bit why you picked her in order

29:22.240 --> 29:29.440
to make your point? That is a great question. The truth is that Rand actually challenged me the most

29:29.440 --> 29:35.120
of any of the pro market writers that I've encountered. I was not very familiar with

29:35.120 --> 29:41.120
Rand's work when I started this project. And I discovered that she defended capitalism in a way

29:41.120 --> 29:45.920
that sharply deviated from the free market economists that I had been reading for years.

29:46.720 --> 29:53.120
Rand's theory is a moral theory of capitalism. And to use morality as a starting point for

29:53.120 --> 29:58.320
thinking about capitalism was completely new to me. Rand thought of herself as someone who

29:58.320 --> 30:04.160
celebrates what humans are. And in her view, they are creative and capable of extraordinary feats.

30:05.440 --> 30:10.960
And because of the nature of human beings, they possess rights, in her view. Specifically,

30:10.960 --> 30:17.680
the individual possesses a right to life and to property. And only if these rights are protected

30:17.680 --> 30:24.000
will an individual be able to realize who he or she is and unleash his or her creative potential.

30:24.880 --> 30:31.440
So when governments interfere with these rights, these rights derive from nature. And so governments

30:31.440 --> 30:37.200
then act immorally when they interfere with them. Since capitalism protects these rights,

30:37.200 --> 30:42.240
it's a moral system, in her view. So this whole way of thinking was really new to me.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.520
And I knew that I would need to settle for myself. What if anything was wrong with her world view?

30:48.400 --> 30:53.040
Also, my book is ultimately about what humanity should do at this point in history.

30:53.520 --> 30:59.520
And Marx and Rand both speak directly to that extremely broad question in a way that is openly

30:59.520 --> 31:06.240
political. And so I wanted to take on a position that did not try to conceal its normative biases

31:07.120 --> 31:13.440
while posing as objective and neutral. And this fight sort of seemed like an open and honest fight

31:13.440 --> 31:21.120
between thinkers. So that's mainly why I chose to devote so much attention to her view in my book.

31:23.200 --> 31:31.520
We've touched upon the subject of market socialism before. But since it is still a

31:31.520 --> 31:36.720
very popular position within the socialist movement, I'd like to hear your general take

31:36.720 --> 31:43.760
on why many still favor market socialism today. And I'm also interested in a specific question

31:43.760 --> 31:49.280
related to that. Because in your book, you write about the historical socialist calculation debate,

31:49.280 --> 31:55.600
and I quote here, in fact, in my opinion, the Austrians forced the debate and they received a

31:55.600 --> 32:03.440
neoclassical answer, end quote. And you already talked about this. What I'm asking myself then is,

32:03.440 --> 32:09.680
does this hold true for today's market socialists as well? Do they provide a neoclassical answer

32:09.680 --> 32:17.520
as well? Or did they come up with a different rationale? Market socialism seems to possess the

32:17.520 --> 32:24.000
best of both worlds. And I think that's a major part of the reason why so many still favor market

32:24.000 --> 32:30.480
socialism. It offers freedom of choice of consumer goods and of occupation. It promotes efficiency

32:30.480 --> 32:36.560
through competition. At the same time, it eliminates private ownership of the means of production. And

32:36.560 --> 32:43.120
so it's aimed at eliminating the capitalist exploitation of labor power. So in addition,

32:43.200 --> 32:46.800
it can also involve Keynesian demand management to lessen business cycles.

32:47.680 --> 32:54.480
It can offer corrective taxes and subsidies to address externalities in markets. It will ensure

32:55.680 --> 33:00.640
sufficient attention to the production of public goods. So it's a mix of characteristics that is

33:00.640 --> 33:05.840
supposed to retain what we like about capitalism while eliminating the rest of it, the things we

33:05.840 --> 33:13.200
don't like or that many of us don't like. It appears to many socialists to be the only answer

33:13.200 --> 33:17.920
that really avoids command central planning on the one hand or capitalism on the other hand.

33:19.040 --> 33:24.000
And so it's like a third way between the two extremes. So I think that's the main reason why

33:24.000 --> 33:34.800
it's been so popular. But in terms of whether market socialists have their views evolved or

33:34.800 --> 33:40.800
changed, I think the rationale for it is still pretty much the same since the socialist calculation

33:40.800 --> 33:46.960
debate, except that maybe less emphasis is placed now in the neoclassical efficiency results.

33:47.520 --> 33:53.520
Now I think emphasis is placed more on issues like equality and solidarity and democracy as

33:53.520 --> 33:59.120
outcomes that are also achieved in addition to efficiency. But to the best of my knowledge,

33:59.120 --> 34:02.400
I don't think the basic position has changed all that much.

34:03.520 --> 34:09.680
And what are, from your position, the shortcomings of market socialism? What are the strongest

34:09.680 --> 34:18.880
arguments against it then? I think market socialism might be able to achieve self-management

34:18.880 --> 34:25.040
within enterprises, although there's no guarantee of that. It has a chance of achieving that,

34:25.600 --> 34:29.680
as well as direct appropriation of profit by the workers within an enterprise.

34:30.320 --> 34:35.040
I think that's probably its greatest strength. But the problem is that it does not eliminate

34:35.040 --> 34:40.000
profit as an economic category, which is a shortcoming. So it really does not abolish

34:40.000 --> 34:47.200
capital as an economic category. So therefore, competition between enterprises will continue,

34:47.200 --> 34:52.240
along with the macroeconomic instability that is experienced within capitalist societies.

34:52.960 --> 34:59.360
Needs will continue to go unmet in the system because profit is really the basic objective

34:59.360 --> 35:04.720
of enterprises still and not the fulfillment of needs. And finally, as the Hungarian economist

35:04.720 --> 35:09.440
Janos Kornia explained, it's likely to slip towards either market capitalism or towards

35:09.440 --> 35:15.200
command central planning. Failure to replace capital with an alternative sort of self-sustaining

35:15.200 --> 35:20.640
dynamic is going to cause its strength to grow to the point where market capitalism is revived

35:21.440 --> 35:24.880
or coercion will be needed to stop its resurgence.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
All right. And that's why you had to come up with a different solution, actually. So

35:32.000 --> 35:39.360
let's get to the end of capital. First of all, let's talk about the socialist laws of motion

35:39.360 --> 35:45.200
that you propose. I think what has become clear by now is that you argue for the abolition of

35:45.200 --> 35:50.960
capital as such and that if we abolish the capitalist mode of production, we of course

35:50.960 --> 35:56.800
need to propose a different mode of production with different laws of motion. In your case,

35:56.800 --> 36:03.040
these would be socialist laws of motion in a first socialist mode of production and later on,

36:03.040 --> 36:07.440
a communist mode of production. Let's do this step by step. First of all,

36:07.440 --> 36:13.120
what does it mean to have socialist laws of motion in place? What are their characteristics

36:13.120 --> 36:20.560
and their logic? By socialist laws of motion, I mean a self-sustaining mechanism that allows

36:20.560 --> 36:27.600
individuals within a complex organic economy to pursue the fulfillment of needs while it also

36:27.600 --> 36:32.880
guarantees them compensation for their useful labor. So if I were to summarize it in one

36:32.880 --> 36:38.480
sentence, that's how I would put it. There's obviously a lot more to it, but it will provide

36:38.480 --> 36:44.240
people with a set of rules and specific forms of interaction that will allow them to cooperatively

36:44.240 --> 36:50.640
work towards needs fulfillment without the social relationships becoming exploitative.

36:51.360 --> 36:57.920
So this mechanism has to be elaborated and understood before it is introduced. We can't

36:57.920 --> 37:03.520
really discover its inner workings after it is brought into existence the way that we must do

37:03.520 --> 37:10.160
with capitalism. The reason again is that the socialist mode of production must be a conscious

37:10.160 --> 37:15.840
creation if it ever exists. It's not going to emerge on its own without anyone's conscious

37:15.840 --> 37:22.560
direction. It's something we have to create. So we need to understand what this social mechanism

37:22.560 --> 37:27.920
is before we actually live in such a society. That's what I argue.

37:28.400 --> 37:35.840
And what is it that you propose? What are the general properties that a socialist mode of

37:35.840 --> 37:42.000
production should have? I argue that the socialist mode of production must place the

37:42.000 --> 37:48.880
self-conscious individual human being at the center. So the individual recognizes the importance of

37:48.880 --> 37:55.200
communicating his or her needs to others and responding to the needs of others when making

37:55.200 --> 38:01.280
decisions about production. It's a society without the capitalist exploitation of labor power.

38:02.080 --> 38:07.760
Labor power does not exist as a commodity, and since markets give rise to labor power as a

38:07.760 --> 38:15.040
commodity, markets do not exist. So the wealth of society does not consist of commodities,

38:15.040 --> 38:21.200
as Marx described capitalist society in volume one of Capital, because commodities are unities

38:21.200 --> 38:27.360
of use value and exchange value. They're both useful things, but they also have a value in the

38:27.360 --> 38:32.800
marketplace. And since there are no markets, then things are not going to be exchange values. They

38:32.800 --> 38:38.560
won't be considered commodities. So every product and service consumed then would only be a use

38:38.560 --> 38:45.520
value. And so the trick is in trying to explain how society can use modern forces of production,

38:45.520 --> 38:51.680
how society can use modern forces of production, including our very extensive division of labor

38:51.680 --> 38:59.600
to produce use values that do not become commodities. So again, I need to make that

38:59.600 --> 39:04.160
more concrete, which I hope to do later in this interview, but that's essentially it.

39:04.720 --> 39:11.600
Yeah, great. I hope so too that we will get to the concrete propositions and we will for sure.

39:12.240 --> 39:19.280
At some point in your book, you quote a neoclassical economists economics textbook by

39:19.280 --> 39:25.360
Samuelson and Nordhaus, which says that, and I quote here, every society must have a way of

39:25.360 --> 39:31.440
determining what commodities are produced, how these goods are made and for whom they are produced.

39:33.920 --> 39:39.840
And that these are the quote, three fundamental questions of economic organization. So here we

39:39.840 --> 39:45.520
have our concreteness actually. I think that's fair enough as a basic practical standard,

39:45.520 --> 39:50.960
or at least I think it absolutely makes sense to expect these questions to be answered in a

39:50.960 --> 39:59.920
socialist economy as well. So let's use these three fundamentals, fundamental questions

39:59.920 --> 40:06.240
in order to go through your proposal. The first one would be how do you determine what is being

40:06.240 --> 40:14.080
produced? I'm really glad you asked this question because these are the questions that show up in

40:14.080 --> 40:20.320
every neoclassical economics textbook, Samuelson and Nordhaus and every other one. All students

40:20.320 --> 40:28.480
of economics are introduced to economics in this way. How can we organize the economy to address

40:28.480 --> 40:32.480
these questions and what are the different ways of organizing an economy to address these questions?

40:33.280 --> 40:39.360
So it's going to be difficult for me to explain the mechanism completely without the use of tables,

40:39.360 --> 40:45.200
but I'll do my best. I refer listeners to a paper on my selected works page that has

40:45.200 --> 40:50.240
the details. It goes into a lot of depth about how this would work. But within the socialist

40:50.240 --> 40:55.440
mode of production, workers councils would post use values in a general catalog or a universal

40:55.440 --> 41:01.520
catalog of use values. And then consumers would select these use values and place them in something

41:01.520 --> 41:07.040
called a needs profile to which they have electronic access. These use values would be

41:07.040 --> 41:12.080
arranged in order from most desired to least desired and given rankings in descending order

41:12.080 --> 41:18.000
as you move down the profile. You can leave empty spaces in the profile that will help one to kind

41:18.000 --> 41:23.360
of rank some needs much more than others. Every person's need is ranked the same as every other

41:23.360 --> 41:30.000
person's need. And this information is used to determine how much of each type of use value

41:30.000 --> 41:35.760
a workers council will produce. And so this really answers the question of what to produce.

41:35.760 --> 41:41.280
Information is collected from consumers as they register needs in their needs profiles.

41:41.280 --> 41:47.200
It'll determine what's produced and the quantities produced. Then how to produce is really the next

41:47.200 --> 41:54.080
question. And the point rankings that are assigned to the use values in the needs profiles are going

41:54.080 --> 42:00.880
to be communicated to the workers councils that posted the use values. So each workers council

42:00.880 --> 42:06.560
will develop its own target mix of inputs that it needs for production and the points would be used

42:06.560 --> 42:14.000
to cooperatively allocate inputs from workers councils that supply inputs. The points then

42:14.000 --> 42:20.480
can be used to allocate inputs according to where the need is greatest. So this method of allocating

42:20.480 --> 42:26.160
scarce inputs provides the answer, I think, to the Austrian critique that socialists lack a method

42:26.160 --> 42:33.120
of economic calculation. Once the inputs are received, it's also necessary to adjust membership

42:33.120 --> 42:39.040
in the workers council to acquire the amount of labor power needed. I have a mechanism for doing

42:39.040 --> 42:45.360
this that involves adjustments in the length of the working period, given income that's based on

42:45.360 --> 42:52.240
experience and effort. So at least this gives you kind of a general overview of how I answer the

42:52.240 --> 42:59.040
question of how to produce these use values. And then a special workers council will also be

42:59.040 --> 43:04.960
established that sets resource consumption limits in each region, which ensures environmental

43:04.960 --> 43:11.440
sustainability. I refer to this as a council of scientists. It has a very special role in the

43:11.440 --> 43:19.440
system because natural resources are available in such huge quantities that when this process of

43:19.440 --> 43:25.920
allocating resources reaches the natural resource base, we need to have some limits on that, some

43:25.920 --> 43:32.960
global limits on how much we're using so that we can meet our environmental goals, which are becoming

43:32.960 --> 43:39.360
more pressing all the time. So finally then, for whom are the use values produced? Well, workers

43:39.360 --> 43:45.200
are paid with credits for their work. And when consumers purchase use values for which they

43:45.200 --> 43:50.720
registered in need, they also receive a bonus in my proposal, which becomes part of their income.

43:50.720 --> 43:56.560
And that's also in the form of credits. So the use values are primarily going to be produced with

43:56.560 --> 44:02.320
those people in mind who registered in need. Others can purchase the use values using credits,

44:03.120 --> 44:07.760
even if they did not register in need, but that action would negatively affect their bonus.

44:08.400 --> 44:15.760
So again, I go into a lot of detail in my online paper and in the book about how all this works,

44:15.760 --> 44:25.440
but those are the concrete details of the system. Okay. So I guess I will have to play the role of

44:25.440 --> 44:32.560
a Advocatus Diabuli a bit, because if you put out a proposal like this, some questions will come up,

44:33.280 --> 44:39.600
for example, relating to the Council of Scientists that you mentioned.

44:41.520 --> 44:47.360
I guess there are two concerns there. One would be the question of elitism, because they have a

44:47.360 --> 44:53.840
powerful role within your proposal. They decide upon the ultimate amount of resources that can

44:53.840 --> 45:00.640
be used for the economy in total, which is of course great because it is a way to deal with

45:00.640 --> 45:07.280
questions of ecological collapse. So this is a plus actually, but still it's a very powerful

45:07.280 --> 45:16.000
position and people do have different ideas towards this question. So I think this will be

45:16.000 --> 45:22.480
a kind of a battleground, of course. And I think the second question that relates to the first one

45:22.480 --> 45:30.640
as well is that maybe it's because of the name. It kind of suggests as if there was such a thing

45:30.640 --> 45:39.600
as one objective truth or even one science, but that's of course not the case. There are

45:39.600 --> 45:48.080
many different sciences. There are different approaches towards the same field of a specific

45:48.160 --> 45:53.360
science. It doesn't mean that there are just many, many different fields for science, but

45:53.360 --> 46:01.200
that there are different approaches towards what science actually is and that there is no such

46:01.200 --> 46:08.720
thing as one objective truth. So I guess my question would be, is there, how do you deal

46:08.720 --> 46:17.280
with this? Is there maybe a bit more, I don't know, more grayish approach and less black and

46:17.280 --> 46:24.480
whitish approach to this question of a council of scientists? This is a great question and

46:26.320 --> 46:32.400
I guess I want to emphasize that this council of scientists has a very limited role to play.

46:32.960 --> 46:39.680
It's really only to identify the quantities of these resources in each region that can be

46:40.480 --> 46:48.720
sustainably extracted and employed in production. The role pretty much ends there and certainly

46:49.760 --> 46:55.600
I have not specified how the decisions within the council would be made.

46:57.280 --> 47:03.760
One can certainly imagine trying to establish rules based on

47:04.720 --> 47:12.000
consensus decision making or majority rule. I haven't come to any firm conclusions about that

47:12.000 --> 47:19.520
on my own. Certainly these scientists would need to defend their positions. They would need to

47:20.160 --> 47:27.840
produce reports defending their claim that we cannot exceed these resource consumption limits

47:28.560 --> 47:35.360
and if we do, this is the likely impact. So there would be checks, there would be scrutiny,

47:36.080 --> 47:42.160
and there wouldn't be much incentive for these scientists to misrepresent their views. There

47:42.160 --> 47:50.240
may be disagreement about how far we can go, but I'm not quite sure how else we, the alternative

47:50.240 --> 47:56.800
is to allow capital accumulation to continue, allow private owners of the means of production

47:56.800 --> 48:03.200
to make these decisions, which I think is a far worse outcome for the planet than if we have

48:03.200 --> 48:08.880
scientists who are thinking about environmental sustainability making these decisions. And we can

48:08.880 --> 48:15.360
also have regional councils so that it isn't all being decided at the global level. That might be

48:15.360 --> 48:24.640
another way to kind of create less centralized power within that council. Or maybe like competing

48:24.640 --> 48:30.800
councils. If you have three councils that each have maybe also different approaches,

48:30.800 --> 48:36.480
scientific approaches towards looking at the question and then later on is democratically

48:36.480 --> 48:42.560
decided upon which path we want to choose. I think at many points within your book,

48:42.560 --> 48:49.520
I was thinking, okay, you have this general body that is described with great detail and then there

48:49.520 --> 48:56.880
are some peripheries that somebody else will have to look into a bit more and then work out

48:56.880 --> 49:03.280
in greater detail because it's actually not possible to have it all. And maybe not a good

49:03.280 --> 49:09.440
way to approach it. If everything is written down in the greatest detail, every aspect,

49:09.440 --> 49:20.560
it's not possible, I think. I think we still have to do some work in order to create this image

49:21.280 --> 49:30.240
within our listeners' minds to get an idea of how this society and how my individual life would

49:30.240 --> 49:36.560
look like. Because I mean, we talked about this general catalog, I can register my needs,

49:36.560 --> 49:41.120
I will have to go to work. That's an important point. I think that you made, I will have to go

49:41.120 --> 49:49.120
to work. But how much I will have to work will depend upon how tedious, actually how popular

49:49.120 --> 49:55.040
the work is that I'm doing. So if the work is really very popular, then I will have to work

49:55.040 --> 50:00.000
a bit longer than the person who is doing the shitty work that nobody wants to do.

50:00.000 --> 50:07.200
We already talked about that everybody will be organized in workers council. That is actually

50:07.200 --> 50:15.200
the name for the socialist enterprise. I think in the book, you also mentioned subcommittees

50:15.200 --> 50:21.280
for different works within the workers council, employment subcommittees and stuff like that.

50:22.000 --> 50:29.280
I think one important point that we will have to mention is the legal right of guardianship,

50:30.080 --> 50:38.400
that would be an interesting point that you maybe can explain a bit more. And I think another one

50:38.400 --> 50:48.400
would be the question of price formation, because that was a very important point. I think who decides

50:48.400 --> 50:58.800
upon how much a given use value actually costs. So maybe let's start with the legal right of guardianship

50:58.800 --> 51:02.560
within the workers council. What is that legal right of guardianship?

51:03.600 --> 51:11.680
Well, within the Marxian tradition, a mode of production also gives or has an associated

51:11.680 --> 51:18.960
superstructure, which includes all of the cultural and legal and religious and political

51:18.960 --> 51:26.320
aspects of society. So I felt the need to in defining the socialist mode of production

51:26.320 --> 51:34.800
to explain at least to this some of the elements of the superstructure that would go with it. And

51:34.800 --> 51:41.680
so one of these is the legal relationship between the workers and the means of production.

51:42.560 --> 51:48.560
In capitalist societies, it's the right of private property that is the dominant form of property.

51:49.120 --> 51:56.480
Means of production are privately owned. So I felt the need to specify a type of ownership

51:56.480 --> 52:02.640
for the socialist mode of production. And it's based on collective or communal ownership,

52:02.640 --> 52:10.480
but that doesn't mean that everyone just simply owns every factory. Instead, it's the workers

52:10.480 --> 52:16.720
councils, the workers who are members of that workers council who work at a particular workplace

52:17.360 --> 52:22.640
are considered guardians. And this is the legal form of ownership in the socialist mode of

52:22.640 --> 52:27.840
production, as I've defined it. So each member of a workers council is also a guardian. They

52:28.480 --> 52:35.040
are charged with using those means of production in the direction of the fulfillment of social needs

52:35.680 --> 52:41.360
and in making sure that those means of production are used properly and for that end.

52:42.320 --> 52:48.400
As I understood it, it's a bit like a cooperative, but without being the owner of the means of

52:48.400 --> 52:53.600
production, actually. So you have these responsibilities, you have rights assigned to

52:53.600 --> 53:00.400
it, but it's just not a ownership of means of productions, no?

53:01.280 --> 53:06.880
Yes, that's right. Because if the workers, for example, couldn't decide, hey, we want to sell

53:06.960 --> 53:11.600
our means of production to a private owner, that's not an option.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.600
But there's still, and I think that's very important for our listeners as well,

53:17.600 --> 53:25.600
there is still personal property, no? So apart from the ownership of means of productions,

53:25.600 --> 53:32.720
if you buy something from the general catalog, it will still be yours.

53:32.720 --> 53:41.680
Yes, that's correct. And I think for me, that was one of the important discoveries that made me

53:41.680 --> 53:50.960
understand what socialism means. Many people, I think, have a fear that even personal possessions

53:50.960 --> 53:57.280
wouldn't be privately controlled or owned anymore. And so I think this distinction between private

53:57.280 --> 54:01.920
ownership or private property and personal property is very important. When you purchase

54:01.920 --> 54:07.600
a use value, it becomes yours. Your relationship to that is a private relationship. You're going

54:07.600 --> 54:13.920
to consume that privately, and therefore, that kind of property right should be different from

54:13.920 --> 54:20.320
the right of private ownership of the means of production. Because private

54:20.320 --> 54:27.200
ownership of the means of production is really what creates these class conflicts. When someone

54:27.200 --> 54:33.600
owns them, then they're in a position where they can appropriate the surplus labor of other people.

54:33.600 --> 54:38.000
And that's what's giving rise to these problems, these huge systemic problems.

54:39.760 --> 54:48.880
I think another huge problem is the profit motive as such. And you have a kind of clever move, I

54:48.880 --> 54:57.760
think, to eliminate this as well. And that is that you detach the question how much people are being

54:57.760 --> 55:06.560
paid within the workers council. You detach this from the question of how much is being produced.

55:06.560 --> 55:13.280
So this kind of tries to escape this destructive logic actually of for-profit orientation. Maybe

55:13.280 --> 55:18.000
could you explain this a bit more? Because I think this is a really crucial point actually.

55:19.360 --> 55:26.080
Sure. The way I describe it is that workers would be paid according to a formula,

55:26.080 --> 55:31.840
basically. There would be a base income when they first enter a profession, and then their

55:31.840 --> 55:37.760
income would grow as they remain in that line of work and become more experienced at it.

55:38.800 --> 55:44.800
So workers councils don't have control of that part of work income. But what they do have control

55:44.800 --> 55:50.160
of is effort ratings. So within a workers council, there would be an effort rating subcommittee

55:50.160 --> 55:59.840
where workers would evaluate the performance of their co-workers. So within some limits that I

55:59.840 --> 56:07.520
think would be global limits, a workers council could assign a percentage increase, let's say,

56:08.240 --> 56:16.160
annually for performing one's work well, or it could be lower, so within some limits.

56:16.720 --> 56:22.240
So incomes then are being determined in this way, and that's completely separate from

56:22.960 --> 56:30.480
enterprise revenues. There is no sense in which workers councils, socialist enterprises would be

56:30.480 --> 56:39.200
selling use values and receiving revenues, and then some of those revenues are used for expenses

56:39.200 --> 56:44.640
and then for profit. Those categories don't exist in this kind of society. People's incomes are

56:44.640 --> 56:50.480
entirely being driven by work and by the bonus income from registering their needs, and so it

56:50.480 --> 56:56.720
abolishes profit. And it has to, because if this is going to be a society that abolishes capital,

56:56.720 --> 56:59.040
you can't have profit as an economic category.

57:00.720 --> 57:07.440
And how is price being determined? I already touched upon it before, but this is a crucial

57:07.440 --> 57:12.000
question for many and I like the way you approached it. How is it being done?

57:13.680 --> 57:19.760
When workers perform work and they receive income, I say that they receive it in the form of credits

57:20.320 --> 57:26.480
and also the bonus income from registering needs and purchasing the use values for which

57:26.480 --> 57:34.000
one registered in need that's paid in credits to. These credits are used to purchase the use values

57:35.040 --> 57:41.280
and when the use values are being priced, they're being priced entirely to

57:42.640 --> 57:52.320
sell the total amount during that purchase period. So the goal is to just clear the market

57:52.320 --> 57:57.920
essentially and also to pursue the steady and complete sale of the use values. So the workers

57:57.920 --> 58:04.960
council might raise the prices if the use values are being sold very quickly. If they're not being

58:04.960 --> 58:12.400
sold quickly, it can reduce the prices of the use values. If they look like they won't be all sold

58:12.400 --> 58:18.720
by the end of the purchase period, then they could be even reduced to zero. So some use values may

58:18.720 --> 58:24.080
be given away freely. It helps to resolve one of the contradictions I think that we see in capitalist

58:24.080 --> 58:30.720
societies where you'd have a depression, people in need and then you'd have goods on shelves that

58:30.720 --> 58:37.040
can't be sold. It eliminates that because now workers councils would see that and they would

58:37.040 --> 58:43.600
have no incentive. They're not making profit from the sale of these use values so they can just

58:43.600 --> 58:48.880
put the prices down to zero and people who need these use values can acquire them.

58:49.680 --> 58:55.440
And the reason why they didn't overproduce in the first place is that their production was

58:56.240 --> 59:02.240
oriented towards the communicated needs from the consumers, no?

59:02.800 --> 59:07.200
Yes, that's right. Actually, I think that's a great point and that would help to cut down

59:07.200 --> 59:13.440
on the problem of overproduction as well. The fact that planning is being done in such a careful way

59:13.440 --> 59:19.520
at the individual level. I think we didn't say that because that's an important information for

59:19.520 --> 59:26.160
the listener as well. If you register your needs within the general catalog, you shouldn't register

59:26.880 --> 59:32.160
like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of needs that you actually do not need because if you do

59:32.160 --> 59:39.520
so, then you won't be getting the bonuses because how much bonus you get is oriented towards the

59:39.520 --> 59:45.120
medium of how much needs were registered by everybody, no? Something like that.

59:45.120 --> 59:52.480
Yes, and actually in the paper that I have on my Selected Works page, I include some different

59:52.480 --> 59:59.200
parts of this bonus and one part is a conservation bonus. So a person who actually includes fewer

59:59.200 --> 01:00:06.400
needs in their profile will receive a bonus for that. So there's flexibility in the system.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.160
The way I've set it up, maybe people would decide to do it differently,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.080
but I'm at least proposing some ways in which to tackle certain problems and one is by creating

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.760
an incentive for people to limit how many needs they register. They're putting less strain on

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:30.000
society's resources and so they deserve a bonus for that. So that's another element.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:39.840
How is the superstructure being decided upon? Because for me, the question of how to approach

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:46.480
these bonus schemes and how people are being disciplined through penalties and such,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:55.120
it's something I intuitively tend to reject, I have to say. I think it's because of the implicit

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:04.000
image of humans that is kind of evoked there. I think I get the point that you're making

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.360
because you're kind of trying to not be utopian but realistic somehow. It's not a communist society

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:19.840
yet, but a socialist one, people will have to go to work and they will not be 100% altruistic

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:28.320
all the time. Of course, one will still have these capitalist logics internalized as well.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:35.520
Of course, there are limits to our resources. I kind of read the whole thing as saying,

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.480
come on, people, let's be honest here. We need some kind of rules. We need some kind of mechanism

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:52.080
to organize our behavior towards a behavior that is better for all of us. But still,

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:01.040
something within me is struggling with this approach of market design and mechanism design.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:07.520
Somehow, I feel that. I think we will get there within the interview, but first, how would this

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:14.800
be decided upon in the superstructure, as I said, the schemes of bonuses and stuff like that?

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:26.240
Yes, that is a great question. I think it would need to be decided through open and democratic

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:34.560
debate. During this transition period, there would be the need for a socialist state or a

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.080
proletarian state to actually implement all this. There would be democratically elected

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:47.200
representatives who would work out these details. I think the important point is that everyone,

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:56.400
every single person, would be subject to the same incentives. Whatever ends up being decided,

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.000
everyone will be affected in the same way. I think that is very important. The bonus for

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:09.200
registering your need and then actually making the purchase. The bonus for leaving items out

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.720
of your needs profile if there is a penalty for purchasing use values for which you did not

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:21.360
register a need. As long as all of those incentives are the same throughout the population,

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.000
I think it will avoid becoming the kind of authoritarian solution that we might fear.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.240
Okay, so let's try to tackle the underlying question of freedom and the individual there,

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:45.120
because I think even though I kind of stumble over some of these market design elements and

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:53.120
incentive logics, I get your point. I think, I hope, but there will be people out there who

01:03:53.120 --> 01:04:01.360
will be saying, oh, come on, that's the next Stalin coming up and stuff like that. The question

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:09.680
of freedom and the question of the individual is a crucial one, I think, if you want to bring in as

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:17.440
many people as possible. Let's try to kind of work out your position on whether or not this is a

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:26.800
free society or not. So which conception of freedom is emphasized within your proposal

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:33.760
and to which conception of the individual does it relate? The individual is free to communicate

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:39.760
one's needs and to know that those needs have an equal impact on the use of global resources.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.880
So that's a new kind of freedom, I think, that doesn't currently exist in our society and one

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:55.360
that people will appreciate. They don't recognize that we could even have such a freedom. So I think

01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:01.520
that's something I want to emphasize. Also, the individual is free to receive compensation for

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.880
work that contributes to the social product. So labor that is performed in serving human needs,

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.840
there is a right to compensation for that. But there are freedoms that are lost, I will

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.560
acknowledge. I mean, the freedom to acquire income at the expense of other people, that goes away.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.000
That's a sad loss.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:31.440
All right. So some of what is considered liberty in capitalist societies goes away.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.960
People will not own businesses. They won't hire workers and then live off the profits. Now,

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:42.720
for some, that will be a major loss, especially small business owners who are also workers

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.960
in those businesses. They will feel that as a tremendous loss. I think that we have to recognize

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.520
that there will be some tradeoffs if we move to something radically different. And it seems like

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:02.720
we're in some ways being forced to pursue these different alternatives. In addition, people will

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.960
not own shares of stock and collect dividends as distributions of profit that have been produced

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:15.280
by workers. That will go away, that kind of stock ownership, because compensation will be based on

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:20.400
work as a member of a worker's council. It won't be based on ownership of means of production,

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.240
which is essentially what stock ownership represents. And finally, the individual will

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:32.000
live and work in a manner that forms a harmonious connection to other human beings and to the

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.640
natural world. That's really what we're kind of striving for with this sort of society,

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.680
that kind of harmony that defenders of capitalism say applies to capitalism, a kind of social

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.320
harmony. But critics of capitalism have always denied that. And so this is aimed at trying to

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.040
create that sort of harmonious connection. So there will be freedoms that are gained

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:01.280
in the new society, self-management in the workplace, workers who currently have no power

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.400
and no say in what happens will have a voice. But there will be freedoms that are lost.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.160
And so I think we need to be honest about that as well.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:19.200
So, I mean, obviously, if you have a general catalogue and you have this administrative body

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:29.440
that is administering this general catalogue, the question of privacy immediately pops up.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:35.520
There's only credit, so this means everything is registered, no? And would there still be

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.960
some way to purchase stuff anonymously?

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:49.120
That's a good question. I think anonymous purchases of use values will be possible.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.840
All purchases really can be anonymous, but the information will enter the system. So there's

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:01.680
a difference there. And are you concerned about the information being communicated to the system

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.520
or it being made public?

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.160
Well, I don't think that it will be made public because that would be a definite privacy breach.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:18.640
But I think there's the concern of misuse. That's one side. And then there's a subjective feeling

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:25.120
of being surveilled or not. Right now, if I want to purchase something that I

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:33.600
want, for whatever reason, if I'm sick and I don't want my employer to know

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.960
whatever, this and that, and I can purchase the medicine anonymously and nobody will ever know,

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:48.960
or there are other things that people just don't want to communicate via consumption

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.080
to whatever system, I guess. So there are both sides to that, at least, I guess.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:05.920
If this became a widespread way of organizing economic activity, if this became the dominant

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.440
mode of production, then opportunities to make purchases in the way you're describing

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:18.000
would diminish greatly. And so that may be something that we would lose.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:24.800
However, I do think that in this system where people's incomes are not derived from

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:33.840
profit or ownership of capital, that there would be much less reason for someone to try to

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:42.400
use the information or even care about the information. If you want to make a specific

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:48.480
purchase, there isn't someone who's going to want to really aggressively market to you.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:55.120
And so I think the potential for abuse would be greatly diminished as well.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.400
I'm not sure about that. I think there will still be a danger there. There are different kinds of

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:11.760
misuse as well, but maybe one should consult the cryptography folks there and try to find some

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.960
technological rerouting because there are things like, I think it's called zero knowledge proofs

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:25.840
and stuff like that. So where it is possible to communicate a certain type of information,

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.200
but still sealing another type of information that is kind of bound to it.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:39.200
So maybe there are some technological workarounds for providing privacy, but still

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:47.680
implementing a system like that. I think that would be an open question to me, that privacy

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:55.440
concern, I think. I think those are good ideas. Yeah. Let's talk to the crypto folks.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:08.320
I guess. Another question is that of coercion. So if somebody does not want to work in your

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:17.440
proposed scheme of things, they say, oh, come on, you socialist guy. I don't support your system.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.920
I don't want to work in that kind of society. I have my small business. I laughed at it and

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:33.280
you took it away. I'm angry. Yeah, I'm glad you brought that scenario up. I'm not suggesting that

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:41.120
there would be that kind of coercive intervention where the state would take someone's business. In

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.560
fact, I want to avoid that kind of coercive intervention as much as possible in this kind

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:52.800
of transition. If a person owned their own business and were the only worker in that business,

01:11:53.440 --> 01:12:01.600
then nothing would change for them. If they employ other workers, then the one

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:08.800
coercive element in this whole thing, if you want to use the word coercion, it would occur in the

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:18.800
transition because at some point the workers at a workplace would need to establish their right of

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.080
guardianship. And so they would need to seize the property. They would need to take control of the

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:31.200
property. That's where it happens. It could happen in a small business if there were enough workers

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.040
who wanted to run it themselves. But yeah, it couldn't happen in a business where there was

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.680
just one person because they already control those means of production. But also, workers don't need

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.400
to participate in this revolution either. They can choose to work for privately owned capitalist

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.000
firms and continue to buy and sell commodities. Their ability to do that is going to decline as

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.520
more workers participate in the transition to a new mode of production. So it's really just this

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.760
coercive element only comes in when the workers take possession of the means of production

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.720
and workers establish this right of guardianship.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:13.040
Okay, that's interesting. So you're already kind of pointing towards the question of transition.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.880
We will get there. But first, I'm very interested in the point that you were raising.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:26.640
How small can a workers council actually be? Is it okay if it's just two people, but both of them

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:32.960
have equal rights within this workers council? So they have what today would be called a small

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:42.480
business, but it's a small cooperative slash workers council. Would that be possible?

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.920
Yes, I think it could be. Now, the system can involve some limits on this. So

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:58.720
let's suppose that a very small workers council is formed and posts to use values. And then

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:05.200
consumers start to include those use values in their needs profiles. Points then would be

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.360
communicated to that small council and the council could use the points to get inputs

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:17.280
to produce those use values. One could, I think, say that since those workers are receiving income

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:24.560
for that work, we might not want the points to fall below a certain level in order for them to

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:32.560
qualify as a workers council to earn that income. So maybe as a minimum number of points per worker

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.920
that has to be achieved before you can even have this happen. Otherwise, there'd be abuse, right?

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.800
I mean, you could have workers who are just really not doing anything or are only receiving a few

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:48.080
points and doing very little work and getting a full year's income every year, and we wouldn't

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.840
want that. So we would have to have, again, probably some global limits on what the minimum

01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:00.800
number of points would be per workers council so that we're ensuring that actually there is

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:07.920
useful work being done towards fulfillment of needs. And that actually touches on upon

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:18.160
another aspect that is kind of interesting. It is possible for workers councils to post new ideas

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:24.240
into the catalog. So I think that's a really important point to make because it's not about

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:30.640
a centralized authority that comes up with, oh, we need 100 of this and 100 of that. But it's

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:40.240
the information and also the ability for innovation is placed within the workers council. So they can

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:46.320
post a new use value in the catalog, and then people can scroll through the catalog. And if

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:52.960
they like it, they will eventually put it on their needs profile. And then it will, if it's

01:15:52.960 --> 01:16:00.400
not just one person, but you know, as you said, some amount is involved, then it will be produced.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:09.280
And I really like that about your proposal. Another question that relates to the overall

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.280
topic of freedom and individuality that we're talking about right now is the question of

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:23.440
unconditional universal basic income, actually, because that is something that does not exist in

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:29.760
your proposal, actually, but it is something that is getting quite some traction right now.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:37.600
And many people are in favor of because it kind of it seems to provide a different kind of freedom,

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:43.680
you know, and I actually I like that about the idea of unconditional basic income as well,

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:50.480
that I get the sense of, okay, I do not have to think about my existential needs anymore.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:17:00.000
These are covered. And from this, I get a very, you know, energizing prospect of okay, now I can

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:12.320
really put my my energy to use wherever I think it might fit the best. And, and but you're kind of

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.200
proposing something different, you have a base income, but it's not unconditional, you have to

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.720
you will have to work for that. Why did you decide against the unconditional basic income?

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:30.400
Yeah, it's a great question. I think the aim of this new mode of production is to ensure that

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.600
people receive compensation for their useful work, and not that they receive compensation,

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.680
regardless of what they do. So the idea behind a universal basic income, I think it's an

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.840
ethical principle that's not really consistent with my understanding of socialism, which,

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.200
which many might find surprising. But I think it's and I even think it's inconsistent with

01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:01.040
Marxism, actually, because I think Marx's description of the lower phase of communism

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.360
was consistent, even though he didn't put it quite in these terms, with the principle from

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:13.760
each according to one's ability to each according to one's work. And so within the socialist phase,

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:20.160
keeping the incentives there to continue working and producing is important. I think when you move

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:25.920
to the higher phase of communism, what Marx Marx described as higher phase of communism described

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.800
as from each according to one's ability to each according to one's need, then you move closer to

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:39.200
something like that, where all you need to do is register your needs in order to have access to

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:44.960
the things you need. Although, although even there, because you have to contribute as you're able,

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:50.320
you do need to engage in some kind of productive work. But this can be broadly defined. And I think

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.960
you know, care work is one possibility, a person need not go to a traditional workplace away from

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.400
the home in order to do this. You know, even though I appreciate the idea behind a universal

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.640
basic income, I think in trying to stick to those ethical principles that I understand,

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:15.760
that relate to socialism, communism, it didn't seem to fit. And that's why I didn't don't have that

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.600
as part of the proposal.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.920
This has been the first of two episodes on the topic of digital socialism and the abolition of

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.880
capital with my guest, Daniel E. Saros. I hope you enjoyed it. Please let me know what you think

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.840
about the topic and write me if you know about interesting thinkers or practitioners for that

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:40.720
matter, that might bring in important contributions to the discussion. This is an ongoing engagement,

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:47.440
matter that might bring in important contributions to the discussion. This is an ongoing engagement.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.240
So there will be more episodes that explore different aspects of what I'd like to call

01:19:52.880 --> 01:20:00.160
the socialist calculation debate 2.0. You can write me via future underscore histories at

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.400
protonmail.com. And you can be a part of the discussion on Twitter or on the future histories

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.720
subreddit. So long, have a good time. Hear you in two weeks.
