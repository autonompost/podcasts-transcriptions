1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Welcome to Huge Histories.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Jan Groos, and it is my great pleasure

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,080
to welcome Robin Hannell in today's episode.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,840
He is professor of economics at Portland State University,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,740
and together with Michael Albert,

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,000
he developed Paracon, short for participatory economics,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
which is one of the most popular models

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,080
for democratic economic planning there is,

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,040
and it has been around for more than 30 years now.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,240
I really wanted to cover Paracon as thoroughly as possible,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,160
leading to more than four hours of material

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
of which you will hear roughly the first half

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,720
in this episode.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,760
The second part will be released in two weeks.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,480
And just to give you some orientation,

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,360
we begin by going through the model bit by bit,

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,280
and I kind of spared my critical questions

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,360
for after the model has been laid out in full.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,440
This conversation is part of a small series

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,840
in which I cover some of the classical models

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,600
of democratic economic planning

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,960
by talking to their creators.

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,920
I already did an interview with David Leibman

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
on multi-level democratic iterative coordination

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,960
in episode 19 of season two,

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
and soon there will be a double episode

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,660
with Pat Devine as well.

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,880
Since all of these episodes are in English,

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
and since there are quite a couple

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
of other Future Histories episodes in English by now,

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,000
we created an English episode only feed

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,840
that you can subscribe to.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,480
So if you don't speak German

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,720
and you are simply waiting

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
for the next English episode of Future Histories,

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,240
please go ahead and take a look at the show notes

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,520
where you will find a link to the English only RSS feed

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,160
as well as the newly created English version

39
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
of the homepage.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,320
Please share among your English speaking friends.

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm always very grateful for propaganda.

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,720
This is really very helpful

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,480
and maybe share in all of your different networks too.

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Thank you so much.

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,120
And speaking of thanks, thank you Bernhard, Fabian

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,440
and Wilfried for their kind donations.

47
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,400
And there's a special kind of Patreon support that happened.

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Happy birthday to Daniel from Malte

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,960
who became a Patreon supporter of Future Histories

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,160
as a birthday gift to Daniel.

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,360
And this is very heartwarming to me.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,640
And I feel honored that this was gifted.

53
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,240
So double thanks to Malte and Daniel.

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,040
But now please enjoy today's episode

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,320
and in-depth interview with Robin Hanell

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,880
on participatory economics.

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Welcome Robin.

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,600
Good to be with you.

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,040
It's a pleasure.

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,000
We will hopefully get into quite some detail

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
about Perikan today,

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,640
but let's start with an overview and broad definition.

63
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,080
What is Perikan?

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,040
It's an attempt to say something concrete

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
about what it is that we think that socialists

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,640
should be proposing as the kind of economic system

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,720
that we wanna replace capitalism with in the 21st century.

68
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,920
In the light of all of the experiences

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,720
with different attempts to create a socialist economy

70
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,480
in the 20th century, what lessons have we learned

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,320
and what should we now be proposing?

72
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,960
It's our proposal of what we left us

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,600
who wanna replace capitalism

74
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,360
with a far better economic system,

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,440
a kind of socialism that's very democratic

76
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,240
and that encourages popular participation.

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,480
And the other thing is that we thought that for too long,

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,920
anti-capitalists have just been very vague

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,920
about what it is they want in light of the Soviet experience

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,800
in the Eastern European countries and Cuba.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,320
In light of all that, we felt like reasonable people

82
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,160
would expect, you have to say something

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,440
a little more concrete than just your values

84
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,400
and your wishes for how the economy should work.

85
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,000
So we thought, well, let's begin that process

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,240
by making some very, very concrete proposals

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
about how all the different kinds of decisions

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,680
that have to be made, how they might best be made,

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
and then we can all talk about it.

90
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,040
So that was the motivation, that was the purpose

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
for putting something out there.

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,400
And then we had to discuss what label to put on it,

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,000
and we ended up with, well, let's call it

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,520
a participatory economy.

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,420
So that was the origins.

96
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,000
Michael and I were very much together on that wavelength

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and the first books we published about it were back in 1990.

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,120
So at this point, it's been around a while.

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,360
And after the fall of the wall

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,720
and the sort of crumbling of the centrally planned economies

101
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,840
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,

102
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,000
there's now been a 30-year debate

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,440
about what should socialists be championing.

104
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,460
And there's various schools of thought.

105
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,580
There's a lot of proposals about market socialism.

106
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,840
There's basically proposals about taking

107
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,540
social democratic capitalism as far as you can take it.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,180
I would call that's Alec Nove.

109
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,320
And then there are other people who have continued to say,

110
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,560
no, we want a lot more planning than that.

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Market socialism isn't really what we socialists

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
should be championing in the future.

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
We really need to talk seriously about planning

114
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,560
and different forms of planning.

115
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,560
So this proposal is one of the proposals that's out there

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
that sort of fits into that 30-year debate.

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,800
And in that context, it's been argued about

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,120
in various journals and at various conferences

119
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,100
over the past 30 years.

120
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,060
And there are some basic principles that inform pericon.

121
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,620
And these are in short, self-governance

122
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,700
through democratic councils of workers and consumers

123
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,460
and their respective federations.

124
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,620
That's the first one.

125
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,780
The second one would be jobs balanced for empowerment,

126
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,460
desirability and caring labor.

127
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,260
The third one would be remuneration according to sacrifice

128
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,660
or effort as judged by coworkers.

129
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,980
And the fourth one would be economic coordination

130
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,980
through a participatory planning procedure.

131
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,860
I would very much like to go through all of them.

132
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,180
Let's start with self-governance.

133
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,700
How would democratic self-governance

134
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,740
be achieved in pericon?

135
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
You did a brilliant job of summarizing

136
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,400
the major features of the proposal,

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,500
so I don't have to, thank you.

138
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
First, we've argued that it's very clear

139
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,660
that it's very important to think very hard

140
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,040
about exactly what you think economic democracy means.

141
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,140
And there's two different views

142
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,260
about what economic democracy means

143
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,900
that are really dominant.

144
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,140
One is, well, it's like politics.

145
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,160
I mean, democratic politics is everybody gets a vote.

146
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,500
Everybody gets a vote and everybody gets the same vote.

147
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
How else can you do this?

148
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,220
In economics, there's also this concept

149
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,780
that's been around for a long time

150
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,580
that right-wingers like Milton Friedman

151
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,060
called economic freedom.

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,420
And that is, well, I should be free to do

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,100
with my person and property whatever I want.

154
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,760
And we want a system that allows people to do that.

155
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,180
And so we have begun, we try to begin the discussion

156
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,420
by pointing out that both of these approaches

157
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,940
to what economic democracy or economic freedom means,

158
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,180
they don't apply in most situations

159
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,180
because particularly when economic decisions are made,

160
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,480
what will happen is any economic decision you look at

161
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,820
will affect some people more than other people.

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,380
So one person, one vote works

163
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,940
as a notion of economic democracy in those cases

164
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,320
where everybody is affected more or less equally

165
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,260
by the decision.

166
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,020
And economic freedom works for decisions

167
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,420
that really only affect me.

168
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,900
I mean, what color underwear should I put on today?

169
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,700
So yeah, of course, we want economic freedom

170
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,440
is the right way to make that decision.

171
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,880
I get to decide, nobody gets to tell me that.

172
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,020
On the other hand, most economic decisions

173
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,940
are decisions where some people will be affected,

174
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,140
more than one person will be affected,

175
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,860
but some people will be affected more than others.

176
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,980
So we have begun by saying,

177
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,800
let's be clear what the goal is here.

178
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,280
The goal is we want to design procedures

179
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,860
for making economic decisions

180
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,340
so that people would approximately have influence

181
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,900
over a decision to the degree that they are affected.

182
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,780
And that's sort of, that's our starting point

183
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,340
in terms of how we go about thinking

184
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,780
about what a democratic economy means.

185
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,980
And we call that self-management.

186
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,900
We define self-management as decision-making input

187
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,660
over things to the degree that you're affected.

188
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,580
And in some cases, that means I'll have more

189
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,500
decision-making authority or input

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,980
than somebody else does.

191
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,860
And in some cases, it'll mean I have some input,

192
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,500
but I don't have as much input as other people.

193
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,720
And in the particular context of workplaces,

194
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,660
what a workplace produces and what technologies they use

195
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,260
and how they go about organizing their work process,

196
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,560
clearly those decisions affect people

197
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,920
in what we propose to be a worker's council,

198
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,520
far more than they affect all sorts of other people.

199
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,980
But it's not that,

200
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,540
their decisions clearly affect other people as well.

201
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,300
What they decide to produce is going to affect consumers.

202
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,060
And if they use these inputs rather than those inputs,

203
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,060
it means, well, if they use particular parts of land,

204
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,020
if they use a piece of land,

205
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,660
that means somebody else can't use it.

206
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,940
So we start with that.

207
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,680
We start with that.

208
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,620
You mentioned that we also start with sort of a position

209
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,380
about, well, what would be a fair way

210
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,180
to distribute the burdens and benefits of economic activity?

211
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,760
And this is something that's hotly contested

212
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,560
by socialists and has been for,

213
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
since socialism first became

214
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,480
some sort of an ideology in a movement.

215
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,320
What is a fair, just how should workers be rewarded?

216
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,260
On what basis should people be rewarded?

217
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,020
And we've argued that when you go through all of that,

218
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,960
and you think it through clearly,

219
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,760
that a desirable economy would be one

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,760
in which workers are rewarded according

221
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,260
to the sacrifices they make when they work.

222
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,760
We've also used the word effort.

223
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,980
Sometimes some people, I mean,

224
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,780
I know there are times when I'm working harder.

225
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,100
I know when there are times when I'm working less hard.

226
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,500
And those who work harder

227
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,740
probably deserve more compensation.

228
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,340
And certainly people who work,

229
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,420
who make greater sacrifices than they work.

230
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,540
I mean, neoclassical economists

231
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,380
call it the disutility of labor.

232
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,420
You're working right now,

233
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,500
but your disutility isn't very high.

234
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,140
You're doing something that you find more,

235
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,100
you're doing something you find more or less pleasant.

236
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,680
The coal miner who goes down a shaft

237
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,300
and exposes themselves to coal dust

238
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,860
and is sweating and coming home sore at the end of the day

239
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,900
is making more sacrifices than somebody who,

240
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,420
somebody like you or me is

241
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,840
during most of the time when we're working.

242
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,860
So we just think those things should be taken into account.

243
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,340
Those are legitimate reasons

244
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,140
for why some people should sometimes be compensated

245
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,420
by more than others.

246
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,060
Now, how you go about doing that.

247
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,900
So how you go about arranging for economic decisions

248
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,940
to be made according to this principle

249
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,660
or goal of self-management

250
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,340
and how it is that you arrange for people to be compensated

251
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,820
according to their sacrifice.

252
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,180
Well, but at least we understand

253
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,540
what we're trying to accomplish.

254
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,460
And we were very self-conscious from the very beginning

255
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,820
and coming up with proposals

256
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,520
for how you would actually achieve those goals.

257
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,500
Now, one thing I'll be very honest about,

258
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,780
we did not think about very much back in 1990

259
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,820
was environmental sustainability.

260
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
So I will plead guilty

261
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,940
as long as most of my socialist comrades of my age

262
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,460
are willing to plead guilty along with me

263
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,620
because we really should.

264
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,940
Leftists and socialists, I believe,

265
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,300
where Johnny come lately to environmental awareness.

266
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,740
We were just so concerned

267
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,540
with all sorts of other things we cared about.

268
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,360
Oh, economic self-management and economic justice

269
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,220
that we sort of took environmental things for granted.

270
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,320
And in many ways, we're just like everybody else

271
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,700
in terms of being woefully un-woke

272
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
on the subject of what was happening with the environment.

273
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,700
But one of the things I'm really proud of is,

274
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,300
and this was, I will give my wife credit for this.

275
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,460
My wife is an environmental economist

276
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,320
and she brought her leftist husband

277
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,040
to awareness about just how negligent

278
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,820
me and my fellow comrades were

279
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,440
in our thinking about environmental issues.

280
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,580
And now I have become, as a professional economist,

281
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,260
I teach political economy, I teach economic theory,

282
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,900
but for more than 20 years,

283
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,760
I've also taught environmental economics.

284
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,700
I can almost prove my point about negligence on the left.

285
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,780
So I taught in an economics department

286
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,460
at American University,

287
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,740
known as sort of a heterodox school of economics,

288
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,580
a PhD program that studied political economy

289
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:39,000
as well as mainstream economics.

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,840
We didn't have a professor, you know,

291
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,680
who was a specialist in environmental economics

292
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,060
for the first 15 years I taught in that program.

293
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,240
And I became an environmental economist

294
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
because somebody had raised their hand

295
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
and said, who's gonna teach

296
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,560
the environmental economics class?

297
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,920
And I said, you know, okay, so I'll do that.

298
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,760
So that's how I became somebody

299
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,740
who actually learned enough about environmental economics

300
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,740
to realize that you have clearly in the year 2020,

301
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,940
clearly any economy to be desirable

302
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,940
has to be an economy that's designed in ways

303
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,860
that is going to help us protect

304
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,900
and preserve the natural environment

305
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,580
far better than any economic system

306
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,540
that people have used up until now.

307
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,820
So I very self-consciously now add the goal

308
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,060
of environmental sustainability, you know,

309
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,660
to economic democracy and economic justice.

310
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,460
And we will get to the mechanisms

311
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,300
that have been incorporated into Perrican

312
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,980
in order to address this question.

313
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,700
Before we go there, maybe you could like guide the audience

314
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,540
through this basic setup of institutions within Perrican.

315
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,740
So this is sort of a thumbnail sketch

316
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,600
of what the major features of a participatory economy are.

317
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,420
We propose that,

318
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,880
that the first is workers councils.

319
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,300
So we don't have private corporations.

320
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,940
Workplaces are governed by a workers council

321
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
where every worker has one vote.

322
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,400
And we can go back to our suggestions or proposals

323
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,320
for how it is that workers councils might want to proceed

324
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,640
in their own process of self-governance.

325
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,960
But we have workers councils.

326
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,020
We also have proposed that consumers,

327
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,540
that consumers be organized

328
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,220
into what we call neighborhood consumer councils.

329
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,620
Because we want to enfranchise consumers

330
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,060
in our planning processes.

331
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,780
And if they act as individuals,

332
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,020
it's very difficult for us to incorporate them

333
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,340
into planning procedures.

334
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,780
But if we simply say

335
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,020
that we organize neighborhood consumption councils

336
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,620
where we're talking about maybe 5,000

337
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,740
or 6,000 families that are living in a neighborhood.

338
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,000
So these are geographically defined neighborhoods.

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,940
And we just want the size of the council to be such

340
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,020
that you could reasonably participate

341
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,940
by going to meetings in your neighborhood

342
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,460
consumption council.

343
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,100
So that's another sort of major institutional proposal

344
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,500
that we have.

345
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
It's a way, we think it's important

346
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,580
to enfranchise consumers in planning procedures

347
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,420
along with workers in their workplace.

348
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,700
What's probably most innovative about our proposal,

349
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,260
I believe, is that there's two different ways

350
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,180
that people have thought you could integrate

351
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,820
the interrelated activities

352
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,360
of hundreds of thousands of workers councils

353
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,980
and hundreds of thousands of consumer councils.

354
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,180
And one would be simply through the market.

355
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,760
Because consumers have to buy what workers,

356
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,360
consumers have to get what workers councils are producing

357
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,360
and different workers councils have to receive inputs.

358
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,440
So there is a, you have to coordinate all this.

359
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,240
And the two ways that the dominant thinking

360
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,620
about how to coordinate all this is,

361
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,440
well, you either have to coordinate it

362
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,640
through market exchanges,

363
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,460
or you're gonna need some sort of central agency

364
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,640
that gathers all the information

365
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
and then puts together a coherent plan

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
for how all this could work out.

367
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,680
And what we have said is both of those are a disaster

368
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,880
that we now can foreseeably predict sort of some,

369
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,920
at least with the, I mean, hindsight's perfect,

370
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,000
but we have the 20th century of hindsight

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,720
to see what happened when socialists tried

372
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,960
to somehow have a central planning agency,

373
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,640
be in charge of this coordinating process.

374
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,560
And it's not a good outcome.

375
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,260
And then the question is, but is there an alternative?

376
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,360
And our answer was, there is an alternative.

377
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,180
And what's I think particularly interesting about it is,

378
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,080
I think the alternative is exactly what early socialists

379
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,160
always thought would go on if you go back

380
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,520
to the late 1900s and early 20th century.

381
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,000
What they always thought was, well, these workers councils,

382
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,720
of course they have, their activities are interrelated.

383
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,840
They're gonna have to plan together

384
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,700
how that interrelation works out.

385
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,720
And so we very self-consciously tried to design procedures

386
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
that would essentially take that view

387
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
of what it is we're attempting to do.

388
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,880
Is there some way that we could have workers councils

389
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,000
proposing what they wanna do,

390
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,760
consumer councils saying, this is what we wanna consume?

391
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,640
And is there some way that they could make

392
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,160
what I call sort of self-activity proposals

393
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,160
and then discover what the consequences of that are,

394
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,600
and then go back to the drawing board

395
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,440
and revise the proposals and resubmit them

396
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,520
so that we could find a feasible plan in this way.

397
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,800
And we wouldn't have a central planning agency

398
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
sitting on top of everybody saying,

399
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,080
well, what you propose doesn't work,

400
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,620
you're gonna have to do this.

401
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,720
And we wouldn't have market forces driving the outcome.

402
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,960
Is there really any reason

403
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,360
that we couldn't do things that way?

404
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,620
So we've worked on it sort of theoretically,

405
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,200
and now we've worked on it with sort of computer simulations

406
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,640
to see whether something that we can prove

407
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,300
under certain assumptions would reach a feasible

408
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,260
and desirable and efficient plan under.

409
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
This is what economists do.

410
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
We say, well, if you make certain assumptions

411
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
about preferences people have,

412
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,360
if you make certain assumptions about technologies

413
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,000
that producers have, then under those assumptions,

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,640
you can prove that some procedure

415
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,160
will reach a particular outcome.

416
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,600
And way back in 1990, we essentially said

417
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,440
under far less rigorous assumptions

418
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,800
than you need to prove that a market capitalist economy

419
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,120
will reach an efficient outcome.

420
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,960
We can say this process,

421
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,520
which we think was what early socialists

422
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,760
and most people drawn to socialism always wanted instead.

423
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,640
This process will work out.

424
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,840
This process could, it works in theory.

425
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,460
Now that left the issue of, but is it practical?

426
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
And we'll come back to this,

427
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,780
but I mean here to put the issue very, very bluntly.

428
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,960
Well, in theory, if we still have,

429
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,680
if we allow the workers and the consumer neighborhood

430
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,060
consumer councils to keep making proposals

431
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,380
and revising their proposals enough times,

432
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,540
in theory, we'll come to a feasible plan

433
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,100
that we can start the year with.

434
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,180
But what if it takes 1000 revisions?

435
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,560
Well, then it becomes a practical impossibility.

436
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,700
So that question was left aside until,

437
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,060
I mean, the best way to answer it

438
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,960
is to convince some country they wanna try it.

439
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,860
But until that happens, then the only answer is

440
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,960
you try and do some computer simulations

441
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,900
to see what happens.

442
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,580
And we now basically have done that

443
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,020
and we have some, I think some pretty interesting,

444
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,460
at least preliminary reporting

445
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,260
that we can do on that subject.

446
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,300
Besides the workers councils that are self-managed,

447
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,500
the consumer councils that are also sort of self-governing

448
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,880
and participate in the planning procedure,

449
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,220
our specific proposal for how it is

450
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,180
that annual participatory planning can substitute

451
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,700
for a central planning board and markets

452
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,140
as a way to come up with a plan.

453
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,140
I think that's the sort of unique and it is unique.

454
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,100
And I think it's a very central part

455
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,780
of what our overall proposal is.

456
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,540
And maybe just for the audience

457
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,060
in order to give some orientation,

458
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,620
the mechanism that is an essential part

459
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,860
of this participatory planning procedure

460
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,900
that will take up all of this information

461
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,460
and process it in a way in order to provide

462
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,100
some first estimates on how to proceed.

463
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,500
This institution is called the IFB,

464
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,860
the Iteration Facilitation Board, isn't it?

465
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,540
Yes, you know, when you're creating things

466
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,300
and you have to put names on them,

467
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,460
some choices are felicitous and some are less so.

468
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,580
And Michael Albert and I remember we talked for,

469
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,780
I mean, we had long conversations

470
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,780
about what name do we wanna give to this system or proposal?

471
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,260
And I mean, I remember one of the early ones we thought of

472
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,980
was decentralized socialist planning.

473
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,700
And I'm the economist and Michael's the political activist.

474
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,960
So that appealed to me.

475
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,980
And Michael argued in this time,

476
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,220
I mean, we've had various arguments over the decades

477
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,860
and sometimes I think I've been right

478
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,540
and sometimes I think he was right.

479
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
And on this one, he was dead right.

480
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,420
He said, you know what?

481
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,940
I mean, we should call it a participatory economy.

482
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,940
If people wanna call it participatory socialism, that's fine.

483
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,020
If people wanna say, well, how does it fit in

484
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,420
to left ideology?

485
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,940
We can say it's libertarian socialism.

486
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,380
In Europe calling something libertarian socialism,

487
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,060
it works because everybody knows what you mean.

488
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,340
In the United States, that's a huge problem

489
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,580
because the only people who call themselves libertarians

490
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,620
in the United States are right-wing libertarians.

491
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,140
So if you say libertarian socialism,

492
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,900
you mostly just confuse people in the United States.

493
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,380
But in any case, we had to come up

494
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,220
with some sort of a name and he was the one

495
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,020
that was just very insistent.

496
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,700
We really decentralized socialist planning, no, no, no.

497
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,900
We should just call it a participatory economy.

498
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,340
I think he was right about that.

499
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,300
The iteration facilitation board

500
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,120
is a very unfortunate name.

501
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,380
And in anarchist circles,

502
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,380
it's also a very hotly contested issue exactly what it is.

503
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,500
So besides the name being unfortunate, it's clunky.

504
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,460
The real issue is, well, what does it do?

505
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,400
And I'll just go straight to the issue here.

506
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,260
Anarchists are suspicious

507
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
that it's just a different name

508
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,500
for the central planning bureau,

509
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,160
that it's a central planning bureau in disguise.

510
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,240
You told us you didn't have a central planning bureau.

511
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,400
You told us that this was an alternative

512
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,880
to central planning,

513
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,020
but you really just sort of hoodwinked us.

514
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,160
You gave it a different name,

515
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,320
but it really is doing what central planning bureaus do.

516
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,160
And so I wanna take care of that immediately.

517
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,120
This thing, whatever you call it,

518
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,360
we haven't got a better name yet,

519
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,220
iteration facilitation board.

520
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,920
This is what it does.

521
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,400
At the beginning of the annual planning process,

522
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,160
it announces whatever the current estimates are

523
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,920
of the opportunity costs of using different resources,

524
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,140
the opportunity cost of using different kinds of labor,

525
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,920
the opportunity cost of using machinery,

526
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,340
stocks of machines that we have,

527
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,580
and whatever estimates the current estimates are

528
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,160
of the social cost of producing different things.

529
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,460
So for an economist,

530
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,440
what it does is it announces an initial price vector.

531
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,860
Now in left circles, I don't wanna use the word price

532
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,100
because as soon as you talk about a price,

533
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,400
somebody thinks there's a market.

534
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,460
As a matter of fact, as soon as you talk about a price,

535
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,400
some people don't even wanna talk to you.

536
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,720
On the other hand, as an economist, I can insist,

537
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,220
well, in order to make a sensible proposal

538
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,220
about what our workplace wants to do,

539
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,360
we have to have some idea of what does it cost society

540
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,760
to use different things we're asking permission to use,

541
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,060
different inputs.

542
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,880
And we have to have some sort of idea

543
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
of whether or not consumers would rather have shoes

544
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,580
or shirts.

545
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,760
So you can't make a sensible proposal

546
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,480
without some sort of information along those lines.

547
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,560
So this is what the iteration facilitation board does

548
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,480
in our annual planning process.

549
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,480
It announces some initial estimates of what those are.

550
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,460
Now in our simulations for the first year,

551
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,320
we said it's just gonna have to announce something arbitrary.

552
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,980
But in the real world, of course, what it would do is

553
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,740
it would begin, it would have a much better initial estimate

554
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,220
to offer than just an arbitrary answer

555
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,820
to what those things are.

556
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,320
It could take whatever they were from last year

557
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,740
and say, let's start with those.

558
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,580
So in either case, and I can tell you something

559
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,140
about when we did the simulations,

560
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,340
how much difference it makes.

561
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,900
You know, if you start from last year,

562
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,960
take advantage of some information you already have

563
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,420
instead of assuming you have no information.

564
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,620
But anyway, they make the announcement.

565
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,780
At that point, all of the workers councils respond

566
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,860
with what I call a self-activity proposal.

567
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,660
We wanna produce this much of these different outputs

568
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,660
and we want permission to use all these different inputs

569
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,800
in order to do that.

570
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,320
The neighborhood consumer councils submit

571
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,020
on behalf of everybody in the neighborhood.

572
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,520
So the neighborhood consumer council is gonna have

573
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,880
to approve individual consumption requests.

574
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,240
And we can come back to whether or not

575
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,700
that's an intrusive process or not.

576
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,000
But in any case, people don't participate

577
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,240
in annual planning as individual consumers.

578
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,740
It's the neighborhood council that participates.

579
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,640
So it sends in, it says, this is the sum total

580
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,480
of all the approved consumption requests

581
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
of the people living in the neighborhood.

582
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,640
And this is the sum total income that all those people have.

583
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,680
And that income can either come,

584
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,160
it's either income because they worked

585
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,440
and their sacrifice effort ratings gave them

586
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,720
that much income or we're gonna, I mean,

587
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,280
obviously you're gonna have social security payments

588
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,880
and disability payments.

589
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,120
You're gonna have need-based payments.

590
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,040
So all that income basically,

591
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,240
and so the consumer council responds to

592
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,960
how much are the consumers,

593
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,880
what's the social cost of making different things?

594
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,720
Responds to that by saying,

595
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,080
here's what the neighborhood consumption council

596
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,760
wants to consume, we've approved,

597
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,720
and here is the total income that we all have.

598
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,200
When those come in, supplies and demands

599
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,140
for everything will not be equal.

600
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,580
So there'll be, when all those proposals come in,

601
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,420
there'll be excess demand for a whole bunch of things,

602
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,100
and there may be excess supply,

603
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,060
offers to supply or availability,

604
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,940
not everything is being used of something.

605
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,380
All the iteration facilitation board does

606
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,100
is adjust its estimates of any price

607
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,580
where there was excess demand, it adjusts the estimate up.

608
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,540
And if it's excess supply, they adjust the estimate down.

609
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,060
That's all they do.

610
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,780
So, I mean, that has been my answer to the anarchists who,

611
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,100
look, given the history of socialism,

612
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,260
it's very sensible to be paranoid

613
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,180
about whether anything called an agency

614
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,900
in charge of a planned economy

615
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,620
is gonna turn into one of those evil

616
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,420
central planning agencies.

617
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,420
So I applaud the fact that somebody really wants to,

618
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,940
that somebody wants to be very careful about that.

619
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,940
On the other hand, my answer is what authority

620
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,420
did this agency exert?

621
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,140
What decisions did they make?

622
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,420
They didn't tell anybody what they had to propose.

623
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,380
They didn't say, your proposal is unaccepted.

624
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,300
They didn't say, well, your proposal doesn't fit

625
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,980
and we need a plan that's feasible,

626
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,460
we're gonna revise your proposal for you.

627
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
They don't do any of those things,

628
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,660
which is exactly what central planning agencies did.

629
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,380
All they do is adjust the estimates that they send out

630
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,980
for the next round of revisions and proposals.

631
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,980
They adjust the estimates to give us more accurate,

632
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,620
to basically give us more accurate estimates of social,

633
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,260
of opportunity costs of using things

634
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
and the social costs of producing things.

635
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,620
That's all the iteration facilitation board does.

636
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,460
And maybe you could dig a little deeper into the question

637
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,540
of how these indicative prices

638
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,460
are actually being calculated.

639
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,100
You state that they are basically estimates

640
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,180
of opportunity costs and social costs,

641
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,340
but how are these measured in concrete terms

642
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,340
and how does one measure opportunity costs,

643
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,140
which is foregone benefit basically,

644
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,020
for all goods and services if individual benefit

645
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,500
is actually a highly subjective and context specific

646
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,700
and also dynamic value.

647
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,100
And this is all additional to the question

648
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,020
whether or not individual benefit

649
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,540
is really the right measure to begin with.

650
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,660
So I was asking myself how this is being done

651
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,900
in very concrete terms,

652
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,300
maybe also for someone who's not an economist

653
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,980
and doesn't really know about the concept

654
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,700
of opportunity costs.

655
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,540
Okay, I'm gonna smile a little bit

656
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,860
and be a little facetious.

657
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,860
I mean, and so I'm gonna be a little facetious and say,

658
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,860
part of the brilliance is that it happens organically.

659
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,020
So there's two sort of ways you can think about

660
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,580
where do these estimates of opportunity

661
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,780
and social costs come from?

662
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,140
And one way of thinking about it,

663
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,740
which is the common sense way to think about it.

664
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,980
And it's the way most people do think about it.

665
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,460
And I think it's the way that most people approaching

666
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,180
socialism have always thought about it is,

667
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,140
well, somebody would have to sit down

668
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,180
and sort of try and calculate that

669
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,540
and take all sorts of factors into account

670
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,300
as part of their calculation.

671
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,420
And that's not what, that's not how it happens at all.

672
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,580
That's not how it happens at all.

673
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,900
Instead, I told you that the initial estimates

674
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,060
can be arbitrary.

675
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,700
And then I said, we start with initial estimates,

676
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,740
the workers councils and the consumer councils respond,

677
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,540
that gives us some excess demands and excess supplies

678
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,220
that tell us the plan isn't feasible yet.

679
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,780
We know to make the plan feasible,

680
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,540
the way to do it is to increase the estimate of things

681
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,260
that are in excess demand and decrease the estimate

682
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,380
of the things that are in excess supply.

683
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,860
An agency does that, but it's a mechanical thing.

684
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,860
It's not sitting down and trying to actually do some study

685
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,140
that leads to the answer.

686
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,900
Now, and the other reason I'm gonna smile and claim

687
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,540
there's a certain genius at work here was,

688
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,740
is well, but what we proved

689
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,220
and all the economists have had to acknowledge

690
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,780
is that, yeah, you did prove this,

691
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,860
is that under standard assumptions

692
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,180
about what people's preferences are like

693
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,060
and standard assumptions about what technologies are like,

694
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,300
the kinds of standard assumptions every economics has

695
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,980
to make in order to do any theoretical study

696
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,780
of what would happen in case.

697
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,740
Under standard assumptions, actually more lax

698
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,100
and there's some assumptions we don't even have to make

699
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,140
that are made to sort of do this kind of analysis

700
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,340
for a market system,

701
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,900
that this process will lead to two outcomes.

702
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,580
The first outcome is, and this is the one

703
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,540
that I would think is the most important,

704
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,420
and this is the one that I would think

705
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,740
is more important to us is,

706
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,020
the first outcome is it'll lead to a feasible plan

707
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,060
where everything that somebody's counting on,

708
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,700
I've been authorized to do this,

709
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,500
but that means I have to be,

710
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm also authorized to receive this in order to do it,

711
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,740
that everybody will be able to actually carry out

712
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,860
the last thing that they proposed.

713
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,700
That's the first thing.

714
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,180
We've demonstrated that you'll get to a feasible plan.

715
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,940
We've also demonstrated that the plan will be efficient.

716
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,540
You won't be misusing resources.

717
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,700
You won't be using a resource to do something

718
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,940
where you're producing something less valuable,

719
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
whereas if you'd used it for something else,

720
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,420
it would have produced something that was more valuable.

721
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,820
More valuable to whom?

722
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,780
More valuable to consumers,

723
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,180
given what it is they're telling you they want

724
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,020
and they don't want.

725
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,300
The third thing is that your final estimates

726
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,620
of these opportunity and social costs

727
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,100
will be as accurate as any estimates

728
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,100
of social opportunity and social costs you can expect.

729
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,420
So it's not that non-economists approach this

730
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,820
in a very sensible, straightforward way.

731
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,940
While you're saying that we're not going to be able

732
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,380
to do that, while you're saying that we need

733
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,140
to know the opportunity cost of using a piece of land,

734
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,900
that's probably a hard thing

735
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,580
to figure out what that would be.

736
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,580
And if somebody were sitting down

737
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,700
and trying to calculate it, it would be hard.

738
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Basically, it would be impossible.

739
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,820
But that doesn't mean that certain procedures

740
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,740
will not generate that information.

741
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,260
And that's what's happening.

742
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,300
It's not that somebody's calculating it,

743
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,820
it's that that answer is being generated.

744
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,620
And it's generated by the process I've described

745
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,100
as the annual participatory planning process.

746
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:41,020
And at some point, there will be a situation

747
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,820
where all of the councils will have to decide up on

748
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,060
whether or not the different proposals

749
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,020
are being accepted or not.

750
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,340
So maybe let's move a step further

751
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,700
within the planning process

752
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,300
so the audience can kind of understand the different steps.

753
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,860
So we reach the point where there will be a feasible plan,

754
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,980
as you call it.

755
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,980
So how are the next procedural steps then?

756
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,500
Yes, if there isn't a central planning agency

757
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,500
that says no, well, then who says no

758
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,700
if a worker council proposes to do some,

759
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,500
they're the only ones allowed to make proposals

760
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,420
and nobody gets to revise their proposals other than them.

761
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,780
So what's gonna prevent a worker council

762
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,580
from doing something that really isn't fair

763
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,620
to the rest of us?

764
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,660
And what's gonna prevent a consumer council

765
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,700
for doing something that isn't fair to the rest of us?

766
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,940
Let's first figure out, well, what would it mean

767
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,780
to do something that isn't fair to the rest of us?

768
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,460
For a worker council, what it comes down to is

769
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,460
you're making a proposal to produce certain outputs,

770
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,860
but you're also proposing that you would be allowed

771
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,340
to use certain inputs.

772
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,940
Well, those inputs have a cost to society

773
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,380
because if you use them, somebody else can't.

774
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,140
And those outputs are presumably

775
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,500
for some other worker council

776
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,100
that finds them more or less valuable

777
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,940
or for consumers who find them more or less valuable.

778
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,620
So there's sort of the social benefits

779
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,540
of all the outputs that you have proposed

780
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,140
and there's the social cost of all the inputs

781
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,660
that you've proposed.

782
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,340
An irresponsible proposal,

783
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,900
I'm gonna call it socially irresponsible.

784
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,020
It would be socially irresponsible for a worker council

785
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,860
to make a proposal where the social benefits

786
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,180
of their outputs aren't at least as large

787
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,700
as the social cost of their inputs.

788
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,660
Because if they do that,

789
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,260
the rest of us are gonna be worse off

790
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,860
if they go ahead and do what they're proposing.

791
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,700
What would it mean for a consumer council

792
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,060
to be irresponsible?

793
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,020
So for a worker's council, the real issue is,

794
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,340
are you gonna contribute more to social benefits

795
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,020
than you do to social costs?

796
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,900
And before I move on, let me point out,

797
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,980
as long as you're not,

798
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,100
as long as the social benefits of your proposal

799
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,220
are at least as large as the social costs,

800
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,780
the rest of us are not any worse off

801
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,100
if you go ahead and do it.

802
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,620
You're not making any of the rest of us worse off.

803
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,700
And so why would we care what you do?

804
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,780
As long as you don't make me,

805
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,780
as long as the rest of us are not made worse off,

806
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,140
go ahead and do whatever the hell you want to.

807
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,100
Now the consumer councils.

808
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,260
So the neighborhood consumer councils are saying,

809
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,020
we wanna consume all this stuff.

810
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,100
Well, it costs society a lot to make all this stuff.

811
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,900
Social responsibility for them amounts

812
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,020
to comparing their aggregate income,

813
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,060
that is their right to consume socially costly goods

814
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,980
and services to the social cost

815
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,500
of their consumption request.

816
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,260
So as long as the income, the sacrifices from work

817
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,580
and the allowances and disability and all,

818
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,500
as long as that is sufficient to pay for

819
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,860
the social costs of a neighborhood

820
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,660
consumption council request,

821
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,220
well then they're not asking for anything

822
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,860
that's not fair for them to have.

823
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,660
If they're asked, if it turns out the social cost

824
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,380
of that neighborhood consumption council request

825
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,780
is greater than their income is,

826
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,140
then they're being greedy.

827
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,580
And the rest of us have every right to say,

828
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,500
no, you can't do that.

829
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,220
Unless you can make some special argument

830
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,500
about why it is this year.

831
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,220
There were a bunch of people who got sick

832
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,300
and they had medical expenses.

833
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,900
Of course, we're gonna have medical expenses free anyway.

834
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,940
But so there are special circumstances that might come in.

835
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,620
So the basic point is,

836
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,580
there is an easy way for everybody to evaluate

837
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,860
first their own proposal.

838
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,300
When you make a proposal,

839
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,540
presumably you'd like to know

840
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,020
if it's socially responsible.

841
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,420
So the only way you know that is to look and see

842
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,780
is our social benefit to social cost ratio

843
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,180
at least one, if not higher.

844
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,660
And then you'd like to know if your consumption proposal

845
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,180
is socially responsible.

846
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,660
And that basically comes down to is the social cost

847
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,980
of what you're asking to consume,

848
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,340
greater than what your income and your fair income

849
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,180
based on sort of efforts and needs and things

850
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,180
and various things that we've worked out.

851
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,380
So you wanna know that about your own proposals,

852
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,740
but there's a way to do it.

853
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,060
We've got these estimates of social costs

854
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,620
and opportunity costs that allow the proposers

855
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,140
to figure out whether their own proposal

856
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,940
is socially responsible.

857
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,060
And importantly, it lets all the other councils

858
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,180
do the same, which is why you don't need

859
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,940
central planners to say no.

860
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,060
We've provided the councils with the information

861
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,100
necessary so that they can self-police

862
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,180
and do it fairly quickly without a lot of,

863
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,340
you know, debate and discussion.

864
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,580
And I think that's the thing that I'm sort of most anxious

865
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,260
to emphasize that aspect of it.

866
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,340
Because I think a large part of the reason

867
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,220
that people are drawn to sort of models

868
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,140
of market socialism is well,

869
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,700
the market takes care of all this for us.

870
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,660
And the only alternative is just going to be

871
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,980
a tremendous amount of arguing.

872
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,900
That's just gonna go on forever.

873
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,380
I mean, one of my colleagues here in the United States,

874
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,300
a socialist feminist economist named Nancy Fulbright.

875
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,860
And early on her reaction to participatory,

876
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,540
you know, the participatory economy proposal was,

877
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,060
Robin, you're a really nice guy.

878
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,020
I understand what you're trying to do here.

879
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,140
We're all in favor of all that,

880
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,940
but this is gonna lead to the dictatorship of the sociable

881
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,220
by which she meant, and as anybody who's been in the,

882
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,420
as anybody has participated in left politics long enough,

883
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,060
you know, one of the nightmares is that the meeting comes,

884
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,300
the meeting is called to order,

885
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,540
probably starts an hour late,

886
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,540
and there's arguing and debating and back and forth.

887
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,140
And we've gone on for two or three or four hours

888
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,540
and sensible people have to go home.

889
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,060
And in the end, the argument goes on and on and on.

890
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,940
And it's whoever was most stubborn

891
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,900
and whoever stayed till two in the morning

892
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
who finally ends up deciding things.

893
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,820
And you don't want a system that comes down to that.

894
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,420
And one of the things that I think is very important

895
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,460
about our proposal is,

896
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,460
we think we have made the central planning agency obsolete.

897
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,580
You don't need it.

898
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,980
And yet we have not burdened people

899
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,820
with endless amounts of meeting time and discussion time.

900
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,860
And we haven't put people in a situation

901
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,780
where the only criteria for making the decision

902
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,700
is who was just most stubborn and held out the longest.

903
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,700
That there's sort of objective ways to quickly decide

904
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,980
was that proposal socially responsible or irresponsible.

905
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,020
And as long as it's socially responsible,

906
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,340
whether it's coming from a neighborhood consumption council

907
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,900
or a workplace,

908
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,700
the rest of us should be totally happy to let them do it.

909
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,980
And there's an easy, and we think that this can all,

910
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,100
I mean, we now know from the simulations

911
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,740
that this shouldn't take more than five or six simulations

912
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,180
to come up with an annual plan,

913
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,860
which can easily be done in the month of December.

914
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,940
That's not to say that there won't be

915
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,660
some special circumstances

916
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,700
that need to have further discussion.

917
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,500
And we can talk about that,

918
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,940
but unless you can take care of the bulk of the decisions

919
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,100
in a way that doesn't require a long trial of some sort,

920
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,860
or a tremendously long and long set of meetings,

921
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,900
as long as you're only using those procedures

922
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,940
for a very small number of cases

923
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,900
that really are special circumstances

924
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,300
and deserve special attention,

925
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,380
we think then it's not a practical impossibility.

926
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,340
Maybe as a quick follow-up question,

927
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,340
so I absolutely understand that you have this notion of,

928
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,460
let's call it parametric coordination

929
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,420
that makes all of these processes very much easier

930
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,020
as you just stated,

931
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:59,260
but within these situations where the councils decide

932
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,020
over the proposals of each other,

933
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,140
and they do have these parametric indicators

934
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,340
that are at the end boiling down

935
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,580
to a ratio of social benefit and social costs,

936
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,260
which makes it easier to decide

937
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,820
whether something is really of social benefit or not.

938
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,500
What would be the mechanisms that allow

939
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,540
for going beyond this kind of parametric decision-making?

940
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,700
Because as you just stated,

941
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,900
there might be situations in which this is not sufficient.

942
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,580
This is not like addressing the specific context

943
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,980
of a given situation,

944
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,740
whether in a council or a workers council

945
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,540
or consumers council for that matter,

946
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,020
it might not be sufficient to address

947
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,180
the complete context of the situation.

948
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:52,180
So what would be the mechanisms to address things

949
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,300
that go beyond this parametric evaluation?

950
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,140
Yes, but there will be situations

951
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,260
where some sort of special consideration is warranted.

952
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,780
So what might that look like?

953
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,260
Before I answer that,

954
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,220
let me just summarize what it is that any worker council

955
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,860
or neighborhood consumer council has to do or not do.

956
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,820
It has to make its own initial proposal.

957
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,060
It has to revise that proposal, its own proposal.

958
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,700
And it has to revise that proposal maybe five or six times.

959
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,940
It also has to vote thumbs up or thumbs down

960
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,380
on all the other proposals.

961
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,380
Now, ordinarily thumbs up or thumbs down

962
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,620
is just if the other proposal

963
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,940
didn't have a social benefit to social cost ratio

964
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,900
that was at least one, our vote is thumbs down.

965
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,180
So it doesn't take a big thinking process.

966
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,060
So that's all that any worker council

967
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,300
or consumer council has to do for itself

968
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,780
and its own proposals.

969
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,780
And it's when they're voting thumbs up or thumbs down

970
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,500
that they're doing what a central planning agency

971
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,500
would do in a different kind of economy, okay?

972
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,700
But it shouldn't take any time.

973
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,980
Now, what about,

974
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,860
so here would be an example.

975
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,980
We have a worker's council and they've made their proposal

976
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,340
and if their social benefit to social cost ratio

977
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,220
is one or higher, they don't have to make any appeals.

978
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,700
They're gonna be approved.

979
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,140
It's not, it's only 0.9.

980
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,900
So it looks like somehow the social costs

981
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,940
of all the inputs they're using are larger than the social,

982
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,300
but they know that's wrong.

983
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,340
They believe this is wrong.

984
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,580
They believe the numbers lie.

985
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,940
I think we need to set up what I call appeal procedures.

986
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,380
So while the whole plan is being made,

987
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,140
it should be possible for a worker's council to say,

988
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,620
look, we know there's something going on

989
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,260
where the numbers are lying

990
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,820
and our proposal really is socially responsible

991
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,940
and we want the opportunity to explain that to somebody.

992
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,420
And so I think that you need to include that.

993
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,140
I mean, in a real world version of this,

994
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,820
you would have to allow for councils

995
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,740
to do that kind of appealing.

996
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,740
But notice what a successful appeal

997
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:36,260
isn't going to be presenting a whole long description

998
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,940
of how wonderful they think their workplace is

999
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,300
and how wonderful their ideas are.

1000
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,100
No, no, a successful appeal will have to take the form of

1001
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,620
the estimates of the social benefits and the social costs

1002
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,100
is accurately, inaccurately measuring

1003
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,500
something that we're doing.

1004
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,900
And I think therefore, appeals,

1005
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,020
as long as appeals are a small fraction

1006
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,860
of what we have to deal with,

1007
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,060
and as long as the appeal procedure

1008
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,660
takes a very coherent form,

1009
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,660
which is the applicant has to basically make a case

1010
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,780
that they're being charged.

1011
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,660
I mean, here being an easy example,

1012
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,460
there's an opportunity cost

1013
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,820
of using a particular kind of machine.

1014
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,260
And they can say, well, it's right for most of the machines

1015
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,220
of this kind, but ours are dilapidated.

1016
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,020
So it looks like we're using things

1017
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,580
that have a higher opportunity cost than it does,

1018
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:46,580
because so essentially the appeal process

1019
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,980
takes a form of challenging the accuracy

1020
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,180
of what's being used to measure in the particular case.

1021
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,340
The appeal procedure for a neighborhood consumption council

1022
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,220
might also be on the grounds that,

1023
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,500
although they could do this out of savings too.

1024
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,780
So a neighborhood consumption council could say,

1025
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,940
we were hit by a flood.

1026
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,820
And sure, we could go ahead and say,

1027
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,020
we need a lot of stuff for repairs,

1028
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,900
and it comes out of our income,

1029
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,380
and we can even go ahead and be approved to borrow,

1030
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,140
but we really shouldn't even be charged for this.

1031
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,740
I mean, we are victims of the disaster,

1032
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,980
and therefore there needs to be an exception in our case

1033
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
of what it is that we're asking for,

1034
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,620
and we shouldn't have to pay for all of that

1035
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,500
out of our entire income.

1036
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,900
I mean, you could handle that

1037
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,580
through disaster relief programs too,

1038
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,020
but something that's not a disaster relief program magnitude

1039
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
that might not qualify for it,

1040
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,580
still is something that a neighborhood

1041
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,740
consumption council could appeal.

1042
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,620
For me, the trick is design a procedure

1043
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,660
where it's only a tiny fraction of cases

1044
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,780
where you would need appeals,

1045
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:03,380
and then make sure that the appeal process is one

1046
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,220
where the appeal process has some grounds for adjudication

1047
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,820
that are sort of rational and make sense.

1048
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,860
So we do have a feasible plan right now.

1049
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,220
This plan has been approved by all of the different councils,

1050
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,140
consumer councils and worker councils.

1051
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:26,140
So maybe as an addition that the audience

1052
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,860
has not yet have as an information,

1053
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,900
the information that the different consumer

1054
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,500
and producer councils have provided into the process,

1055
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,420
this information is aggregated information.

1056
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,340
It's not detailed information.

1057
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,540
It's not that every consumer council has proposed

1058
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,060
every detail of each good

1059
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,260
and provided this information for the process,

1060
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,180
but it's aggregated information.

1061
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,580
So we are now within our imaginary planning process

1062
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,140
at the point where we have a feasible plan.

1063
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,580
It has been approved,

1064
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,220
but the plan entails more or less broad informations

1065
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,660
about what has to be produced.

1066
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,780
What are the next steps?

1067
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,500
How is this aggregated information transformed

1068
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,940
into detailed products by the worker councils?

1069
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,940
So on January 1st, we have a feasible,

1070
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,540
efficient annual production plan,

1071
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,100
but there's two problems.

1072
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,500
There's still two problems.

1073
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,940
One is at plan says the categories are gonna be categories

1074
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,660
such as women's dress shoes.

1075
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,780
It's not going to be size such and such.

1076
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,100
It's not going to be, I don't remember what I called it,

1077
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,260
but I had a funny name for it.

1078
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:01,260
You know, the woman's leather high-heeled shoes

1079
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,740
with the yellow toes problem.

1080
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:10,620
So the plan is going to be in terms of sort of

1081
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,340
broad categories of goods and services.

1082
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:19,260
And yet you have to produce a particular shoe

1083
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,500
that might be a little bit different.

1084
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,020
How does that all get worked out during the year?

1085
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,380
That's one question.

1086
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,780
And another question that's, it's related.

1087
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,860
It's a little different, but it's related.

1088
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,860
And that is by January 15th,

1089
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,580
something we assumed when we made the plan

1090
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,980
isn't gonna be true anymore.

1091
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:45,980
So there's both the, how do you translate

1092
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:51,540
broad categories of goods into detailed categories of goods,

1093
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:56,100
and how do you adjust for things that happen

1094
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,140
that were not foreseen when the plan was drawn up?

1095
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,620
And here's where the conversation has been very difficult

1096
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,940
amongst leftists.

1097
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,940
And I'll give you two examples.

1098
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,940
The Jacobin dismissed the whole idea

1099
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:22,020
of a participatory economy entirely on the grounds

1100
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,020
that obviously planning, you know, for an economy

1101
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,020
that has, they use the example on Amazon alone,

1102
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,700
there's so many millions of different goods.

1103
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,020
So how could you have a broad category of goods

1104
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,900
so how could you ever plan for how much

1105
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,220
of those millions of goods?

1106
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,700
And that's just Amazon alone.

1107
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,980
David Schweikert, who is a proponent of market socialism,

1108
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,220
where he says, well, markets can handle this, but you can't.

1109
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,580
Basically said, well, the whole thing is very interesting.

1110
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,460
This idea of a participatory economy,

1111
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,100
but it's just nonsense on stilts

1112
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,820
because it can't handle this.

1113
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,140
It's been 30 years now since there were any planned economies.

1114
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,580
Now there's still a planned economy in Cuba.

1115
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,340
I don't know what they have in North Korea,

1116
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,620
but I think it's a planned economy.

1117
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,060
So, but nobody knows anything about them anymore.

1118
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,980
So in popular consciousness,

1119
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,980
there's no memory anymore apparently that, you know,

1120
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,060
the Soviet economy did actually manage, you know,

1121
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,220
to plod along for, you know, going on 50 years

1122
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,260
in the Eastern Europe.

1123
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,420
And as anybody should now realize,

1124
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,020
I'm not a proponent of that system,

1125
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,420
but the whole notion that comprehensive planning

1126
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:48,420
is just a practical impossibility is belied by the fact that,

1127
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,700
well, it obviously wasn't a practical impossibility.

1128
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,620
It might've been a very undesirable way to do things,

1129
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,620
but it wasn't a practical impossibility

1130
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,900
There must be some way to translate, you know,

1131
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,900
from broader categories to more refined categories.

1132
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,500
And there must be some way to make adjustments

1133
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,340
during the year,

1134
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,860
because there were a whole bunch of economies

1135
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,020
that managed to do that for decades and decades.

1136
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,420
Not to say they did it well,

1137
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,540
and not to say that it wasn't,

1138
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,820
and that some of the sort of obvious problems

1139
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,580
that those economies had,

1140
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,900
which, I mean, the major problem

1141
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,620
that the centrally planned economies was that,

1142
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,780
I mean, one major problem

1143
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,180
was they really disenfranchised consumers.

1144
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,260
So everybody's aware of the, oh yeah,

1145
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,620
I mean, in the Soviet Union, you know, you could get shoes,

1146
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,740
but everybody's shoes all look the same.

1147
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,100
Well, by the end of the Soviet Union,

1148
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,580
that wasn't really true.

1149
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,860
On the other hand, the variety that capitalists

1150
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,340
and market systems had to deal with,

1151
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,940
the variety that capitalists

1152
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,300
and market systems had to offer,

1153
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,660
I don't think that variety was ever offered

1154
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,460
by any centrally planned economy.

1155
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,220
So it's a reasonable idea that maybe planned economies

1156
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,220
are not as nimble in these regards.

1157
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,540
But that's what it comes down to.

1158
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,660
It's not like it's a practical impossibility.

1159
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,940
We know that's the case.

1160
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,220
Well, here's how you would translate.

1161
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,340
So you have a plan,

1162
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,420
you're a workers council and you're making shoes.

1163
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,620
And you have a plan that's approved to you,

1164
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,060
you know, that's been approved for you

1165
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,780
to make certain amounts of shoes, you know, for adult women.

1166
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,700
And you go ahead and make them.

1167
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,420
And they get shipped to the distribution centers

1168
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,380
and people start picking them up.

1169
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:40,860
And it turns out that the red ones are going like hotcakes

1170
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,380
and the yellow ones are just sitting on the shelf.

1171
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,140
Well, you do just exactly

1172
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,620
what any capitalist shoe making business does.

1173
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,260
You know, you shift over

1174
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,460
and you start making more of the red ones

1175
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,620
and you make fewer of the yellow ones.

1176
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,580
So in terms of detail,

1177
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,260
it works out in a planned economy,

1178
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,220
just the way, there's no reason it can't work out

1179
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,540
in a planned economy that is sensitive

1180
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,500
to what the consumers want.

1181
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,140
Now, I mean, this is an interesting question.

1182
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,780
And I do think that one of the things

1183
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,780
that capitalism has done has disempowered consumers

1184
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:28,060
relative to producers in all sorts of important ways.

1185
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,460
So what it's gonna come down to is,

1186
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:34,300
so I'm shipping shoes,

1187
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,420
but the shoes I'm shipping aren't being picked up.

1188
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,420
What if I don't change?

1189
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,060
What if I continue to ship the yellow shoes

1190
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:47,020
when the red ones are going like hotcakes?

1191
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,820
Well, then the issue is, well, do I get credit for that?

1192
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,300
And another issue is,

1193
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,460
and this is sort of relevant to sort of empowering consumers.

1194
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,620
One of the problems consumers face in market systems is

1195
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,620
you didn't get something that you thought you were getting.

1196
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,860
Now, of course, every capitalist business

1197
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:16,220
mouths the slogan, the consumer is always right.

1198
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,020
But it's totally insincere.

1199
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,500
I mean, what they mean is,

1200
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,660
we're gonna tell you you're always right,

1201
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:27,500
but we're gonna make sure that we don't have

1202
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,980
to exchange your product unless we absolutely have to,

1203
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,020
and we're gonna make it as difficult as possible for you.

1204
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,620
So, I mean, one of the things we've suggested is,

1205
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:42,380
wouldn't it be nice if as a consumer,

1206
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,940
something you get delivered isn't what you expected.

1207
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:49,540
Instead of you fighting with the workers council

1208
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,380
that produced that and delivered that,

1209
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,660
you just turn it back over to your consumer federation,

1210
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,620
say, it's unacceptable,

1211
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,940
and let your consumer federation battle

1212
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,980
in a much more powerful position with the workers council

1213
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:09,220
and its federation about whether or not this was up to specs.

1214
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:14,220
So my answer is, there are answers to these problems.

1215
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,260
The popular consciousness,

1216
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,940
we now have 30 years when none of these economies

1217
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,700
that were comprehensively planned have existed.

1218
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,140
And so people are having a hard time imagining

1219
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,740
how it's even possible.

1220
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,540
There's an analogy to this.

1221
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,420
Before Adam Smith came along,

1222
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:41,340
popular consciousness was, how could it possibly work?

1223
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,980
How could a market system possibly work?

1224
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,900
I mean, how will the producers know

1225
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,180
what the consumers want?

1226
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,020
So, I mean, feudalism made economic decisions

1227
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,060
in a certain way, and Adam Smith was saying,

1228
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,380
we don't need to make economic decisions that way at all.

1229
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,380
We can just leave, we can have individual producers

1230
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,580
and individual consumers out there,

1231
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,060
and as long as they can buy and sell

1232
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,700
from one another in a market, it's all gonna work out.

1233
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,340
And there was a time in history

1234
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,860
where people just had a hard time imagining that.

1235
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,500
And he became famous for saying,

1236
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,620
see, something you can't even imagine

1237
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,940
is actually readily possible.

1238
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,420
And I think we're back in a similar situation

1239
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,940
where we're arguing

1240
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,900
that you can do comprehensive planning.

1241
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,820
It's not a practical impossibility,

1242
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,140
but for 30 years, nobody has seen it

1243
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,380
and everybody just can't imagine it anymore.

1244
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,300
But I think we've got perfectly sensible answers

1245
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,540
for how the more broad categories

1246
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:52,220
get translated into more refined categories.

1247
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,220
It's simply, when it's delivered,

1248
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,100
some things will be picked up and purchased

1249
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,900
and some things won't,

1250
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,100
and you do sensible adjustments

1251
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,700
when that turns out to be the case.

1252
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,220
That means you're gonna have to order more red dye

1253
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,980
and less yellow dye, and then that's an adjustment

1254
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,980
that's gonna have to be made too.

1255
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,420
My answer to the doubting Thomas's is,

1256
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,060
that's not rocket science.

1257
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,900
Do you really wanna argue about that?

1258
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:25,700
I mean, maybe as an addition, you used the term

1259
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,460
that the producers will need to be sensitive

1260
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,300
to what people actually consume.

1261
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,060
One might add that, I mean,

1262
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,060
there are sensors proliferating throughout the world today,

1263
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,660
and we have digital technologies,

1264
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,260
information and communication technologies

1265
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:49,260
that are very much able to sense much more

1266
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,900
than was able before.

1267
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,500
So this might also be a factor that comes into play.

1268
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,980
That's something that is out there

1269
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,700
in popular consciousness, and I think it's good,

1270
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,340
which is that technologies have changed a lot

1271
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:10,500
in terms of just supply-side management technologies

1272
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,620
have changed a lot.

1273
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:16,420
And the ability, I mean, I buy all my books,

1274
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,340
I probably shouldn't admit to this

1275
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,260
because I'm obviously not supporting

1276
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,100
my local leftist bookstore.

1277
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,940
But when I can buy a digital version

1278
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,420
of a book I want on Amazon and get it on my Kindle

1279
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,100
in literally five seconds, yes, I do that.

1280
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,660
So there's been changes in technology

1281
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,220
that basically make all of this adjustment stuff

1282
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,620
a lot easier than it would have been 40 years ago.

1283
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,900
But I wanna point out,

1284
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,300
so I think that the things we're talking about

1285
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,940
in terms of how speedy and efficient

1286
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:03,420
can the detail and adjustment process be

1287
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,180
given today's technologies as compared to 40 years ago,

1288
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:09,580
actually a lot better.

1289
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,100
But I don't wanna concede the point

1290
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,980
that we could have still had this kind of economy

1291
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,020
40 years ago.

1292
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,460
It just wouldn't have been quite as quick and efficient

1293
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,700
about making the adjustments,

1294
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,060
but it would have been fine 40 years ago too.

1295
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,100
It wasn't like the new,

1296
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:27,460
we didn't have to wait for these new technologies.

1297
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,140
And there's a similar,

1298
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,900
sort of the socialist calculation debate

1299
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,260
had a similar issue,

1300
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,180
which was the original objection

1301
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:43,180
to socialist economies that came from the Austrians

1302
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:49,580
was, well, it's just too many equations.

1303
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,900
You could never solve all the,

1304
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,700
they were imagining central planning

1305
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,540
and they were saying,

1306
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,860
there's no way you could possibly solve all those equations.

1307
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,740
And that's the beauty of the market system.

1308
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,780
You don't need a huge computer.

1309
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,620
And they were right that in 1900

1310
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,380
when the debate was going on was like pre-World War I

1311
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,660
and sort of post-World War I.

1312
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,660
They were right that we didn't have powerful computers.

1313
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:23,020
And people like Paul Cotshot and Alan Cottrell,

1314
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:23,900
they've made the point,

1315
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,260
but now we do have these computers.

1316
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,580
So we could calculate a very, very detailed,

1317
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,260
large central plan.

1318
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,220
And my answer is, yes, we could now and we couldn't then,

1319
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,820
but we still don't want to, but for different reasons,

1320
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,660
just because we can do it doesn't mean we want to do it.

1321
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,700
But in this case, yeah,

1322
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,300
of course we would want to use all that new technology

1323
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,100
to make the adjustment process.

1324
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,700
You want to adjust for details,

1325
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,260
you want to adjust for unseen events.

1326
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,820
And if we've got new technologies

1327
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:55,220
that would make all that easier and more efficient,

1328
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,740
of course that makes the whole thing work better.

1329
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,060
We should be very happy about that.

1330
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,620
So now we have actually transformed

1331
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,700
these aggregated information

1332
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,100
into aggregated pieces for production,

1333
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,300
inputs for production,

1334
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,420
and they have been transformed into detailed products

1335
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,380
by the workers councils.

1336
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:22,380
And from there on, people will go to stores

1337
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,180
just like they do nowadays

1338
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,500
and will purchase these items,

1339
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,180
depending on how much credit, so to speak,

1340
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,700
they have coming from their work

1341
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,060
within each workers council.

1342
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,980
So I'm a consumer

1343
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:44,140
and I had an annual consumption proposal

1344
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,380
that's been pre-approved.

1345
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:51,260
And so now, and I want to admit to something personally,

1346
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,700
I don't shop.

1347
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,900
There's only one thing I shop for,

1348
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,420
I'm the cook in my family.

1349
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:03,500
So I shop for, I go to food stores.

1350
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
So I shop in food stores,

1351
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,820
which is why I know how people shop,

1352
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,700
because I don't think I've ever bought a piece of clothing

1353
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,540
I've ever worn.

1354
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,940
So I shop for books and I shop for food.

1355
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,820
When I shop for, and when I shop for food,

1356
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,620
I'm a bargain hunter.

1357
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,100
So that's why I know when I go up and down the aisles,

1358
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,780
I'm looking to see what the price tag on that thing is today.

1359
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,860
And if it's not a sale price tag,

1360
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,100
I'm gonna probably pass it up

1361
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,980
and hope for something better tomorrow.

1362
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,180
So that's why I know that when people shop,

1363
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,500
you show them price signals and that's how they respond.

1364
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:42,060
But the whole idea of sort of shopping

1365
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,380
is really foreign to me.

1366
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,900
And I had a group of students

1367
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,100
who came into my office one day

1368
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,060
and they said, well, we're in your class

1369
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:55,820
and you've been talking about this participatory economy.

1370
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,780
But there's just one thing that

1371
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,860
we either don't understand or we don't like about it.

1372
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,900
And what they said was,

1373
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,180
you don't really understand the pleasures of mauling it.

1374
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,300
And I thought they were saying maul, M-A-U-L.

1375
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,860
And then it turned out, no, no,

1376
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,780
they meant the pleasures of going to the shopping mall,

1377
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:28,620
seeing and being seen and just deciding on the spot,

1378
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,340
what do you wanna buy or not buy?

1379
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,820
And I told them, I said, you're absolutely right.

1380
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,700
Your dream is my nightmare,

1381
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,580
being caught in a shopping mall for more than five minutes

1382
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,500
it would be a death sentence as far as I'm concerned.

1383
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,580
It's the last thing I'd ever wanna do.

1384
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:50,580
But I understand, you have a reasonable demand here.

1385
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:55,940
And so that is a question of how do you accommodate that?

1386
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,780
And so the whole idea, I never thought about

1387
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:03,580
how the goods are actually being picked up and distributed.

1388
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,740
I just thought of people as,

1389
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,620
well, you're going to your local food store

1390
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,300
and that's how you get the food

1391
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,060
that you're gonna go home and cook.

1392
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:14,340
But there's no reason that you can't have shopping malls.

1393
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,220
I remember at one point in time,

1394
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,380
and I think it's still true in Cuba,

1395
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,380
they used to do, they did these big displays.

1396
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,740
They wanted to show people in Cuba,

1397
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:31,460
what new kinds of goods might become soon available

1398
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,340
that they hadn't been seeing for a while.

1399
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:37,420
And so they would do these sort of demos.

1400
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,700
And they would put on sort of like a fair

1401
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:45,700
where the economic ministry was basically saying,

1402
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,780
basically saying, come out to think

1403
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,200
like a shopping mall thing,

1404
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,820
we're gonna show you new products

1405
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,780
so you're gonna see the kinds of things.

1406
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,860
There's no reason that we can't,

1407
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,140
those would all be good ideas.

1408
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,100
But essentially my vision always was certain items

1409
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,180
would get distributed to distribution centers,

1410
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,540
which really are only for one neighborhood.

1411
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,660
Other items is probably gonna have to cover

1412
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,500
four or five neighborhoods,

1413
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,300
the kinds of goods that get sent there to be distributed.

1414
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,860
But I always envisioned is you're picking it up,

1415
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,820
you've got your swipe card.

1416
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,600
At some point along the line,

1417
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,380
your swipe card starts to tell you

1418
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,140
that you're actually picking up more of certain things

1419
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,220
than that you had ordered.

1420
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,620
Do you wanna make an adjustment

1421
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,820
or is this just something that you're gonna make up for?

1422
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,060
That's where the new technology really is,

1423
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,660
really should help in making the adjustments.

1424
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,980
But that's the kind of process that I think

1425
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,680
from the point of view of a non-shopper,

1426
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,880
that's about the best I can say.

1427
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,440
Yeah, and I think it's quite important for many people

1428
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,240
that there is some form of flexibility still

1429
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,680
and that you do not,

1430
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:59,680
that you're not hold to buying exactly the things

1431
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,700
that you were thinking of at the beginning of the year,

1432
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,740
but this could be done in a fashion where,

1433
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:11,740
I don't know, if you achieve an amount of like 80 to 90%

1434
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,880
of things that you already knew

1435
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,440
that you will consume, this is very good.

1436
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:20,240
And then if there rests 10 or 20% of goods

1437
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,760
that you consume over the year

1438
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,600
are those that are being consumed in a more dynamic

1439
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,540
and flexible and spontaneous way,

1440
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,480
then this is still an improvement, I guess.

1441
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,360
So this doesn't have to be an either or situation.

1442
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,500
I would concur, that's the way I think about it too.

1443
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,720
There are two issues.

1444
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,840
I mean, one is easy to take care of.

1445
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,760
What if somebody during a year ends up

1446
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,720
consuming less than they were,

1447
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,320
I mean, the sum total social cost of what they consume

1448
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,960
is less what they're approved for.

1449
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,800
Well, that's easy.

1450
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,120
Then it just goes into,

1451
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,560
it adds to their savings and the savings account.

1452
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,360
Now, what about somebody who ends up consuming more

1453
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,880
than they were approved for during the year?

1454
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,980
Well, in that case, they're basically borrowing.

1455
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,880
And it's some, I mean, I don't think you ever have

1456
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,120
to sit in judgment over us.

1457
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,720
If somebody wants to save,

1458
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,240
who the hell is ever gonna say no?

1459
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,000
If somebody wants to borrow,

1460
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,160
and oh, but you're borrowing every year

1461
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,240
and you've been borrowing every year for 15 years

1462
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,080
and it's kind of becoming clear

1463
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,780
that you aren't really planning

1464
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,320
or whether you're planning to pay it back

1465
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:34,360
or you're just, you think you're planning to play it back

1466
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,320
but it's becoming rather obvious to the rest of us

1467
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,280
that you can't, somebody has to sit in judgment over this.

1468
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,640
One of my daughters works for credit unions

1469
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,800
and basically has, one of her jobs is

1470
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,360
people taking out new car loans to buy new cars.

1471
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,040
And so she's constantly watching cases where,

1472
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,120
yeah, you thought you had a credible plan

1473
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,080
about your payments, but in fact, you don't.

1474
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,040
So I think of it more as you're still gonna have

1475
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,340
something like credit unions

1476
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:07,920
and a credit union is going to have to sort of,

1477
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,240
they're gonna have to monitor

1478
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,240
whether borrowing has become insincere.

1479
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,160
But there's total flexibility about saving and borrowing

1480
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,400
in terms of the grand sum total of what you're spending

1481
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,420
in a year being different from what you proposed.

1482
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,280
There's really no problem in handling that.

1483
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,800
The difficulty is for particular items.

1484
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,800
So if certain things, for a certain item,

1485
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,320
the grand total amount that consumers

1486
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,960
are taking off the shelves

1487
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,640
is greater than what was planned for,

1488
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,200
then we have a decision to make,

1489
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,200
well, who's gonna get it and who isn't?

1490
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,280
And there you would have a complicated,

1491
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,000
I mean, there I think you have a somewhat complicated issue.

1492
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,960
Well, I had it in my order

1493
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,000
and so should I have priority over somebody

1494
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,060
who didn't have it in their order.

1495
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,360
And there's another issue about,

1496
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,300
well, do we just also take care of this

1497
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,740
by adjusting the price?

1498
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,680
And in the latest book I wrote,

1499
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,360
I sort of discussed these very,

1500
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,500
what are the pros and cons of handling these situations

1501
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,380
which will inevitably arise one way or another?

1502
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,480
And I think there are some pros and cons

1503
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,080
of handling it one way or another

1504
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,400
and there are issues that will arise.

1505
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,080
I mean, like from the tip of my head,

1506
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,760
I would say like you could easily reserve some item

1507
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,160
for a period of time

1508
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,600
and if it's not consumed during this time period,

1509
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,880
it will be free to consume for anybody else

1510
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,040
who's interested in the item.

1511
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,060
And then additionally, this question of pricing

1512
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,880
comes into play, but that's just a side note.

1513
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,040
There is a complimentary aspect

1514
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,580
to this question of consumer flexibility

1515
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,780
and that is the question of flexibility

1516
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,120
on the side of producers

1517
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,480
because another thing that the Austrians brought forward

1518
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,240
and you mentioned them already

1519
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,920
in the context of the socialist calculation debate,

1520
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,180
another thing that the Austrians brought forward

1521
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:26,180
is this question of competition as a discovery mechanism

1522
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,920
and the question of how does innovation come into being,

1523
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,360
into the world, into how is this idea

1524
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,400
of the new being handled within an economic system?

1525
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:43,400
So how would Perkin go about this process of innovation?

1526
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:48,820
How is it being decided whether or not resources

1527
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,440
can be allocated sensibly into a direction

1528
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,720
which might not be like fully developed

1529
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,540
where the odds are not clear

1530
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,660
whether or not something might succeed or not.

1531
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:07,260
So how is all of this being decided upon?

1532
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,700
Yeah, by the way, the, I mean, the tooth,

1533
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:13,180
that the whole Austrian school and the Austrian debate

1534
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,940
in the popular consciousness in the United States,

1535
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,740
it's quite different than in Europe.

1536
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,220
In Europe, you all know the Austrian school,

1537
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:26,300
you all know von Mises, you all know Hayek

1538
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,140
and then you know the names of a few other people

1539
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:28,980
who I don't.

1540
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:32,420
In the United States, the only name we know in this regard

1541
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:34,180
is somebody named Milton Friedman

1542
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,660
who was not part of the Austrian school,

1543
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,220
but who sort of,

1544
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,460
he took their arguments,

1545
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:51,460
dumbed them down, also screwed them up to a great extent

1546
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,900
and basically that became sort of what his popular

1547
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,220
consciousness about the impossibility of socialism

1548
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,040
being sensible to a US audience.

1549
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,700
So I just wanted to throw that out there in terms of,

1550
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,300
there are certain subjects where,

1551
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,100
I mean, it's the same as social democracy.

1552
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,220
You all know what that means in the United States,

1553
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,720
nobody knows what that means.

1554
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,540
It's the same as libertarian socialism,

1555
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,860
you all know what that means and in the United States,

1556
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,660
it means something very different.

1557
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,260
But anyway, to your question about innovation

1558
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:32,100
and I think this is a very legitimate concern.

1559
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,300
I think the conclusion

1560
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,740
that the centrally planned socialist economies

1561
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,720
were deficient in terms of their ability to generate

1562
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,440
sort of innovative economic activities.

1563
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,600
I think it's well taken.

1564
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,640
And so when I study those systems to try and figure out,

1565
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,480
well, what was it about their incentives?

1566
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,320
What was it about their decision-making and reward systems

1567
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,360
that led to such poor performance in this regard?

1568
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,960
I think there was poor performance

1569
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,400
and there have to be reasons for it

1570
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,520
and it's important to understand what they were.

1571
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,420
And so I spent a decent amount of time

1572
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,600
studying the logic of central planning

1573
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,800
and seeing why it would not be in the interest

1574
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,160
of enterprise managers to innovate.

1575
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,720
Why would they disguise their capabilities

1576
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,720
rather than sort of try and stretch to?

1577
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,080
Now, the first thing I would point out is

1578
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,880
think of a worker's council in a participatory economy.

1579
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,000
Anything they can do,

1580
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,280
any innovation they could introduce

1581
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,940
that would increase their social benefits

1582
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,520
of what they're providing

1583
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,440
or decrease the social costs of what they're using

1584
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,240
is gonna rebound to their benefit

1585
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,460
because it's gonna make it easier

1586
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:59,840
to get their proposals accepted.

1587
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,940
So if an enterprise could come up,

1588
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,020
broadly speaking, there's two kinds of innovation.

1589
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,920
One is anything that cuts down the costs

1590
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,920
of what we're making

1591
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,240
or anything that increases the sort of quality

1592
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,240
and the quantity of what we're producing.

1593
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,440
So we certainly have incentives

1594
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,520
for workers councils to be searching for all those things.

1595
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,640
Here is where there's a real dilemma though.

1596
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,880
What if a worker's council comes up with a new innovation

1597
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,960
that reduces its social costs

1598
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,880
or increases its social benefits?

1599
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,520
And any economy faces this dilemma.

1600
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,120
So we have one unit that came up with the innovation.

1601
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,200
It's very inefficient if the innovation

1602
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,600
doesn't get immediately used

1603
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,000
by all the other worker councils in the industry.

1604
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,360
I mean, to have one council in the industry

1605
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,440
doing something that's more efficient

1606
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,980
and the rest of them aren't allowed to,

1607
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,800
well, that seems silly.

1608
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,400
And yet that's what patents do.

1609
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,160
That's essentially what a patent does.

1610
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,140
Now, maybe not forever,

1611
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,480
maybe the patent only lasts for 20 years.

1612
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,300
And once you have the patent,

1613
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,840
you could sort of negotiate with other firms in the industry

1614
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,600
and you could negotiate a price

1615
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,240
and also allow them to use the patent for a certain payment.

1616
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,720
But essentially what patents do

1617
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,400
is they slow down the spread of innovation.

1618
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:46,320
Oh, but they also provide a tremendous incentive to innovate

1619
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,380
and that's the argument in favor of patents.

1620
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:56,380
So my first observation is you really cannot have,

1621
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,880
it seems like you can't have your cake and eat it too.

1622
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,820
If you want what economists call static efficiency,

1623
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:08,520
you want everybody to use the innovation

1624
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,720
as quickly as possible.

1625
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,520
But if you want quote unquote dynamic efficiency,

1626
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,360
incentive to search for the innovation,

1627
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,520
then you have to prevent it spread.

1628
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,080
So it seems like there's a trade-off

1629
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,960
between these two goals.

1630
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,120
Well, we've taken one extreme position on this,

1631
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,320
which is any innovation immediately

1632
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,000
becomes available to everybody else.

1633
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,120
So we're gonna spread immediately.

1634
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,600
Does that diminish the incentive

1635
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,000
for an enterprise, for a workers council

1636
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,600
to look for innovations

1637
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,960
because they basically can't sort of hoard it?

1638
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,280
And I think maybe it does.

1639
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:52,440
I mean, I think we have to honestly say, well, okay,

1640
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:57,320
let's consider the consequence of immediately saying

1641
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,700
all innovations are open to anybody.

1642
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,360
And then the question is, well, what can you do?

1643
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,880
And my answer is there's still two things you can do.

1644
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,240
One is if you actually take a look at research,

1645
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,920
a lot of innovative research in the United States,

1646
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,840
in the United States,

1647
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,960
there's sort of famous studies about innovation.

1648
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,040
And what they've discovered is

1649
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,880
the federal government of the United States

1650
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,880
has paid for so much more innovation than anybody realizes.

1651
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,080
Everybody thinks it's that creative entrepreneur out there

1652
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,080
who did the innovation.

1653
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,480
You'd be amazing how much your tax dollars

1654
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,720
paid for innovation.

1655
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,560
You'd be amazing at how much innovation

1656
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,760
your tax dollars paid in the US military,

1657
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:58,120
that became important innovation throughout the economy.

1658
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,640
So there's another way to stimulate innovation,

1659
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,880
which is basically just to pay for it.

1660
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,640
So why shouldn't we have industry federations

1661
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,640
with very large research institutes attached and budgets?

1662
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,280
And why just have industry federations with that?

1663
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,080
A lot of the innovations have to do with new products

1664
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,920
from a consumer's point of view.

1665
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,400
Let's have the consumer federations

1666
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,120
also have very large research institutes

1667
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,960
that are associated with them.

1668
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,040
And then any research that those federations

1669
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,640
manage to come up with, innovations that they...

1670
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,520
Well, then of course, those federations...

1671
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,560
It immediately goes to all the enterprises in the federation

1672
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:48,600
because that's who the members of the federation are.

1673
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,240
So that's one way.

1674
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,040
And the other way is, and I've said this,

1675
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,600
I think it would be very important

1676
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,360
for a participatory economy to keep very close tabs

1677
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,520
on whether they think that the economy

1678
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,600
is sort of lacking for innovation.

1679
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:11,920
And despite the fact

1680
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,680
that they've got these big research institutes,

1681
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:18,120
and despite the fact that if you can come up with a way

1682
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,960
to improve your social benefit to social cost ratio,

1683
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,560
it's to your advantage,

1684
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,520
but everybody else is gonna get to use it right away too.

1685
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,720
So if that proves to be a problem,

1686
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,120
is there something we could still do?

1687
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,560
And I think there is.

1688
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,760
You simply grant prizes for innovation

1689
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,480
to individual worker councils.

1690
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:45,160
So if you need to dangle a sort of material benefit out there

1691
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,720
for individual worker council innovation,

1692
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,480
there's no reason you can't do it.

1693
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,680
I would argue you're doing it at the expense of fairness.

1694
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,400
I mean, it depends.

1695
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,760
If you think that innovation is the result of extra effort,

1696
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,280
then in some sense, it's not even at the expense

1697
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,680
of economic justice if you're paying bonuses

1698
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,720
for innovations coming from enterprise.

1699
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,960
On the other hand, if you think that innovation

1700
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,120
is largely not a result of that,

1701
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:21,120
it's sort of luck and innovations are basically,

1702
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:25,560
what they really are is it's a whole sort of process

1703
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,480
through time that takes place.

1704
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,200
And it's hard to say any particular person

1705
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,480
was responsible for this whole thing.

1706
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,160
And then I think that would simply

1707
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,560
have to be a decision-making.

1708
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,360
If the people in the economy felt

1709
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,880
we're not being innovative enough,

1710
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,800
we need to do something further,

1711
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,000
then there's something you could do.

1712
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,080
I would just quite, I think it's important

1713
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,000
to always be honest about what you're doing,

1714
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,680
at least with yourself.

1715
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:58,320
And in this case, I think that what you might do is say,

1716
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,160
we're worried about innovation,

1717
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,960
we're putting a priority on it,

1718
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,760
and we recognize that to some extent,

1719
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:08,400
it might be at the expense of sort of economic justice.

1720
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,320
I think there are plenty of ways to go about this.

1721
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,240
And some of those you sketched,

1722
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,920
I would definitely totally agree with.

1723
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,080
And I think that additionally,

1724
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,840
there might be some type of kind of crowdfunding.

1725
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,560
There might be some budgets that are explicitly put away

1726
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,640
for like some wildcard kind of stuff

1727
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,880
where people that have an idea, an initial idea,

1728
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,640
and that like carry some form of risk

1729
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,000
in the form of resources that are needed

1730
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,240
and that are not already like covered

1731
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,960
in some way, shape or form,

1732
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,320
that might apply for this kind of funding

1733
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,280
and that is specifically put away

1734
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,280
for like wildcard innovation or something like that.

1735
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,800
Crowdfunding is very popular in the younger generation

1736
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,360
and it's a pretty big deal.

1737
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,200
There's a lot of it that goes on.

1738
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,880
The crowdfunding that I am most impressed by

1739
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,880
is that in our elections in the United States,

1740
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:18,560
Republican candidates traditionally always get,

1741
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,280
are much more adequately funded

1742
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,440
than Democratic party candidates

1743
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,720
because they're getting the big corporations

1744
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,480
and the wealthy contributions.

1745
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:30,640
And we basically don't prohibit that.

1746
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,160
We don't say there are limits

1747
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,040
or it's easy to get around the limits.

1748
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,960
But one of the things that's happened basically

1749
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,640
with the Bernie Sanders campaign

1750
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:46,640
is that small donation funding for progressive candidates

1751
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,080
has proved to be,

1752
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,400
partly it's because of the rise of the internet too,

1753
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,240
has proved to be remarkably,

1754
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:02,240
it's even the money spending field

1755
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,920
in a lot of races in the United States over recently.

1756
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,120
And I know, and there's all sorts

1757
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,800
of socially worthy projects and business ideas

1758
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,200
that have successfully fundraised in this way.

1759
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,400
So there's actually been a debate about

1760
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,640
whether this would be a good idea or a bad idea

1761
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,400
or what the pros and cons of it are on equity grounds

1762
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:31,040
on the participatoryeconomy.org website.

1763
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,560
Because there's a lot of people

1764
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,160
that are interested in this.

1765
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,160
Sometimes crowdfunding basically allows the person

1766
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:46,080
who has donated to get a share of whatever comes out of it.

1767
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,200
So there's two kinds of crowdfunding.

1768
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,480
One is it's basically, it's just a donation.

1769
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,840
And the other is, no, you're actually,

1770
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,960
in some sense, you're buying into the business.

1771
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,920
And at some point you would get some reward

1772
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,000
for having done that.

1773
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,440
And those are two very different things

1774
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,760
in terms of what the equity implications are.

1775
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,480
It could also be implemented on a structural level,

1776
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,640
because when I was thinking about crowdfunding,

1777
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,080
it's not in the typical sense

1778
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,600
that you would have to take some of your money

1779
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,560
and put it into a crowdfunding project

1780
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,400
or something like that.

1781
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,480
But it could be implemented on a structural level

1782
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:29,480
where each and everybody gets a certain amount of tokens

1783
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,720
that you cannot spend for anything else,

1784
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:37,400
that those are associated with some form of fund

1785
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:42,400
for innovators who are kind of trying to test out new ideas

1786
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,360
and stuff like that.

1787
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:47,320
So this would be a slightly different type of scheme.

1788
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,400
And one of the outputs for the people

1789
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:53,040
who put in the tokens for a given project

1790
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,000
could be that they might simply get the use value

1791
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,920
that is being produced earlier than the others

1792
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,440
or something like that.

1793
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,280
But this is a sidetrack, I would say.

1794
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,480
Yes, I mean, when I was thinking of research,

1795
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,040
when I was thinking of Workers' Federations

1796
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,760
having large research enterprises

1797
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,040
that are affiliated with them,

1798
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,040
I was thinking of them funding that.

1799
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,520
And I was thinking the same thing on the consumer side.

1800
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,800
On the other hand, you could basically have...

1801
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,280
The tokens could be basically tokens

1802
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:31,040
that individuals are saying, I want that research.

1803
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,120
I'm putting my token toward that research.

1804
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,880
Yeah.

1805
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,720
Yeah.

1806
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:40,040
And another question that I was asking myself

1807
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,160
in terms of what you call user rights,

1808
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:48,160
how do you distribute user rights over a given comments

1809
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:52,520
so that whoever can make the best use of the comments

1810
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:55,360
is actually allocated the right to use it?

1811
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,520
Because this is a difficult question.

1812
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,400
I mean, there might be many people

1813
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,760
who propose to use a given comments that is there to use,

1814
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,040
and it's difficult to decide who might actually get it.

1815
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,360
This is the same subject as, well,

1816
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,080
public versus private ownership.

1817
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:17,160
So let's step back to sort of old socialist times.

1818
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,800
The first thing that the old socialists used to say is,

1819
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,080
well, the means of production need to be...

1820
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,880
The means of production shouldn't be in private hands.

1821
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,880
The means of production should be socially owned.

1822
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,960
And what kind of means of production

1823
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,080
were they thinking about?

1824
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,720
I mean, they were thinking about the factories

1825
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,520
and the machines and the factories.

1826
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,000
They shouldn't belong to the capitalist.

1827
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,480
They should belong to all of the workers collectively.

1828
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,960
That means the economy still has to figure out

1829
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:55,400
how to assign a particular factory or a particular machine

1830
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,440
to be used by this group of workers

1831
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,520
or that group of workers.

1832
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,400
And that's what the plan supposedly does.

1833
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,320
Well, I mean, that also applies to land.

1834
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,320
I mean, land is like a machine.

1835
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,160
You use land to grow food.

1836
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,720
And in the Soviet Union, I mean,

1837
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,920
I was thinking the other day in the early Soviet Union,

1838
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,720
I mean, what actually produced the Russian Revolution

1839
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,440
was when the peasants actually took over the land.

1840
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,160
It was 80% of the population.

1841
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:30,360
There's no Russian Revolution except the peasants say,

1842
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,240
the feudal lords who used to own the land

1843
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,360
and we worked on it as serfs

1844
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,000
and then we became free to serfs

1845
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,720
and we basically had to pay them rent.

1846
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,920
We're taking it over.

1847
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,760
And then they set up, sometimes they set up state farms.

1848
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:49,440
That was the form in which the land is public was manifest.

1849
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,400
Sometimes they set up collective farms,

1850
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,680
which were somewhat different in terms of

1851
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,360
how the land was handled on a collective farm

1852
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,400
than a state farm.

1853
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,320
But certainly we have a sort of a history

1854
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:04,440
of socialist believe that that land

1855
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,360
and those factory and those machines,

1856
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,120
it's what I call part of the productive commons

1857
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,760
and it belongs to everybody and nobody.

1858
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,320
And the issue simply is figuring out

1859
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,520
who gets user rights over it

1860
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,200
on what sort of basis.

1861
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,800
And that's what the plan does.

1862
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,960
So if you look at our participatory planning process

1863
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,040
and if you're a worker council

1864
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:38,040
and you're proposing to produce so many tomatoes

1865
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,280
and so many heads of lettuce,

1866
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,520
then you're also saying, well, one of the inputs is

1867
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:45,440
we want these many acres of lands, et cetera, et cetera.

1868
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:50,120
And we don't want you to grow tomatoes on it

1869
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,280
if it would be better for avocados.

1870
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,840
And if there's another worker council

1871
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,560
that is wanting to land for avocados,

1872
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,280
then they're gonna put in a proposal saying,

1873
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,280
we wanna use it.

1874
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,640
So that's the importance of we wanna know

1875
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,120
what the opportunity cost of using that land is

1876
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,240
because we want it to go,

1877
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,560
we want a system that will assign it

1878
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,680
to whichever workers council

1879
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,840
can make the most socially productive use of it.

1880
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,400
And I think that's part of what the planning process

1881
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,120
is actually doing.

1882
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:23,840
Now, there's another part of the productive commons

1883
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,520
that has been a lot trickier.

1884
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:30,000
So there was the traditional ideas

1885
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
of the machines in the factory

1886
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,880
and that sort of extends to land.

1887
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:41,040
But there's also that, I mean,

1888
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,720
mainstream economists will call natural resources,

1889
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,280
they call them natural capital.

1890
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,560
So you have produce capital machines, buildings,

1891
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:53,520
you have natural capital and then you have human capital.

1892
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:00,160
And human capital is sort of my native talents

1893
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,040
and my education and my training

1894
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,520
is what gives a particular person

1895
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,280
a certain amount of human capital.

1896
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,360
Well, should that be socially owned?

1897
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,960
Should we view that in the same way

1898
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:18,240
that we view the machines and the factories

1899
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,520
and the land and the natural capital

1900
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,160
as it belongs to everybody and nobody?

1901
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,360
No, it's me.

1902
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,800
I mean, it's mine.

1903
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,920
Well, how's that any different

1904
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,240
from the way people used to think of this land is mine?

1905
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,840
This machine is mine.

1906
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,760
That's the part I think that sort of

1907
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,280
both politically and philosophically

1908
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:47,960
and personally and psychologically becomes more difficult

1909
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,280
for people to think in the same terms.

1910
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,200
We have argued that it's all the same.

1911
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,920
And so we sort of said,

1912
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,120
it's all part of the productive commons

1913
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:05,320
and it doesn't belong to anybody or it belongs neither,

1914
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,200
it belongs both to all of us and none of us.

1915
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,360
And the question is simply how to use it

1916
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:18,360
and how in a planning procedure to award user rights over it.

1917
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,080
There's of course a debate about,

1918
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,600
I mean, when you're thinking about compensation,

1919
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,320
there's been a long debate among socialists

1920
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,640
about whether, well, if I have more human capital

1921
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:38,960
and therefore the social value of my contribution

1922
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,840
when I work an hour is higher than yours,

1923
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,200
then I deserve higher pay.

1924
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,720
And then there are people who've argued,

1925
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,840
no, that actually isn't, you don't deserve higher pay.

1926
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,120
You deserve higher pay if you made greater sacrifices maybe,

1927
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,760
but not simply because you have more human capital

1928
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,200
than somebody else.

1929
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,520
So those arguments have gone on forever amongst socialists.

1930
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:08,800
And what it reduces to is whether or not human capital

1931
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,560
is are we gonna now consider human capital

1932
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,720
the same way we consider natural capital,

1933
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,760
the same way we consider produce capital

1934
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:21,400
as it belongs to all of us and none of us.

1935
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:25,200
It's something we collectively in our generation

1936
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,800
inherit from all those previous generations before us.

1937
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,680
And that's how it should be treated.

1938
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,640
And we wanna design an economic system

1939
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,200
that treats it all that way.

1940
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:39,240
And that's been our vision and that's been our argument.

1941
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,360
But I know in terms of coming up,

1942
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:47,520
I know that in terms of meeting opposition

1943
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,600
from some fellow socialists

1944
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,280
about whether or not they agree or don't agree

1945
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,360
that this is an area of great disagreement.

1946
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,040
And when you think about it,

1947
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,400
of course we know it's an area of great disagreement.

1948
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:07,720
It was hotly debated in the Soviet Union for 50 years

1949
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,200
where there were time periods

1950
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:13,240
when there were big bonuses given out to people,

1951
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:16,160
to engineers and people, I mean, one of Stalin's,

1952
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,640
in the early days, it was sort of,

1953
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,360
well, everybody gets paid the same

1954
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,760
and maybe we'll all argue about

1955
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,440
everybody's gotta put in more effort

1956
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,480
and we'll fight with each other

1957
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,880
about you're slacking off and I, et cetera, et cetera.

1958
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,240
But there was no sort of,

1959
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,480
in the early days of the Russian revolution,

1960
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,880
there wasn't strong support

1961
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,560
for the more highly educated and the engineers

1962
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,920
getting much higher pay scales.

1963
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,640
Whereas at some point during the 30s and the 40s

1964
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,280
and the 50s, that became,

1965
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:53,600
Gorbachev finally sort of voiced

1966
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,120
that as what socialism was.

1967
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,560
He literally said that we,

1968
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,960
people deserve to be paid

1969
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,600
according to the value of their social contribution

1970
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,320
and some people's social contribution

1971
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,080
is objectively higher than other people

1972
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,280
and it's perfectly fair that they be paid more

1973
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,840
and they should be paid more.

1974
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:15,000
Gorbachev finally arrived at the point of just saying,

1975
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,200
that's what the, that's the justification.

1976
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,400
We're doing it and we should be doing it.

1977
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,560
Whereas I think that I would always have argued

1978
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,520
against that as being fair

1979
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,920
and I think many socialists throughout history

1980
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,400
have also felt no, that isn't particularly fair.

1981
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:35,760
And just to check back whether or not I do get it right.

1982
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,480
So like very specifically on the question

1983
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,520
of how it is being decided upon

1984
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:46,920
who gets user rights over a given comments

1985
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,160
and you already explained that your notion of the comments

1986
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:55,160
is a very like enlarged version of the comments actually.

1987
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,680
So the answer to the question

1988
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:01,920
of how this is being decided upon

1989
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,440
is again, this question of social benefit.

1990
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:10,960
So whether or not a given resource

1991
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,800
is actually being used in a way

1992
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:18,800
so that the social benefit is higher than the social cost

1993
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,000
and the way that this is being calculated

1994
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,200
is along the lines of opportunity costs.

1995
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,040
Do I get that right?

1996
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:27,880
Just to check it out.

1997
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:31,680
Yeah, I wrote an article where I talked about it as,

1998
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,560
I talked about it as the productive commons

1999
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,040
for modern times.

2000
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,080
I think there was a time period

2001
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,400
when socialists thought about the commons,

2002
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,360
they just thought about the machines in the factory

2003
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,200
and land.

2004
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,760
And now what we, I mean, modern times requires us

2005
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,600
to think about the productive column.

2006
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,840
So I'll list everything that's in the productive commons.

2007
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:00,560
It's those machines in the factories, just like always.

2008
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,320
It's land.

2009
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,800
It's any other natural resources,

2010
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,280
including that big thing up there

2011
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:11,160
that is storing all our greenhouse gases,

2012
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:14,120
which is basically like a commons

2013
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:17,200
that whenever you use it and exploit it,

2014
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,640
it's something that we need to take account of.

2015
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,200
I think that everything that mainstream economists

2016
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,680
call human capital is part of the productive commons.

2017
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:35,000
And technology is part of the productive commons.

2018
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,920
And that's when we were talking about patent rights

2019
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,200
and who gets to use it.

2020
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,360
And then we were talking about it in the context

2021
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,800
of sort of stimulating innovation.

2022
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,240
Whatever clever ways we have come up

2023
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,760
with making things in the past.

2024
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,320
So all of that is part of what I simply call

2025
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,360
the productive commons.

2026
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:59,360
And it doesn't belong any more to one person than another.

2027
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,880
But it's important that we want to allocate user rights

2028
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:10,200
over it to whoever can make the most efficient use of it.

2029
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:15,200
But nobody gets to reap the rewards personally

2030
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,040
of the fact that they're using it.

2031
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,120
So if we give the machines to the workers in this factory

2032
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:26,000
because they can make the best use of that machine,

2033
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,800
that doesn't mean the workers in this factory

2034
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,120
get higher income than the workers in some other factory.

2035
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,160
And here's the real hard dividing line.

2036
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:38,240
So in our annual planning process,

2037
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:42,240
we're going to come up with the estimates

2038
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,960
of the opportunity cost of using an hour

2039
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,880
of electrical engineering labor.

2040
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,520
And we're going to come up with the opportunity cost

2041
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,680
of using an hour of carpentry labor.

2042
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,440
And we're going to come up with the opportunity cost

2043
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,640
of using an hour of just ditch digging labor.

2044
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,360
And they aren't going to be the same.

2045
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,120
Now does that make sense?

2046
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,640
Now does that mean that somebody in our economy

2047
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,880
that digs ditches or works as an electrical engineer

2048
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:15,200
or works as a carpenter is going to get paid higher wages?

2049
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,640
And our answer is no.

2050
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,560
That'll be depending on inside their worker council,

2051
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,480
whatever procedures their fellow workers set up

2052
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:28,920
to decide whether they're putting in extra effort,

2053
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,400
working extra hours,

2054
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:36,560
working under less favorable or desirable conditions.

2055
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:42,880
So that's the way that we think there is,

2056
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,720
we think it's a separate logic

2057
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,600
for how you allocate user rights over things,

2058
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:52,480
including different categories of labor that doesn't,

2059
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,520
but that doesn't have to,

2060
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,960
for different categories of labor,

2061
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,800
it does not have to translate into

2062
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,480
that's how we therefore pay people differently.

2063
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,320
Which at a certain point in the early 1940s,

2064
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,240
Stalin was just advocating

2065
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:16,520
for those who were fortunate enough

2066
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,400
to get the engineering degrees

2067
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,360
and have those skilled kinds of labor

2068
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,760
in the Soviet economy during that time period.

2069
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,920
I know the early years of the Cuban revolution

2070
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,760
and when Che Guevara was still around,

2071
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:30,560
they were very clear on this point.

2072
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,440
And the Cubans always had an attitude about it.

2073
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,840
I mean, their attitude about it in the early years

2074
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,600
in the Cuban revolution was we only have the resources

2075
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,680
to send so many people to school to become doctors

2076
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,040
or to become engineers.

2077
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:53,080
And anybody that we sent to school doing that,

2078
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,360
they're already lucky.

2079
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,560
They're the ones that got the extra education

2080
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:00,200
and we couldn't give it to everybody.

2081
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,800
And they owe society.

2082
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,720
So the whole idea that you were lucky

2083
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:08,360
that you were the one that was trained to be a doctor,

2084
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,760
we have every right to send you out to work

2085
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,240
for five years in the countryside,

2086
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:15,600
giving, making sure that little kids

2087
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,400
don't die from dehydration.

2088
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,840
I mean, that's fair.

2089
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:25,160
The idea that you deserve to be paid 10 times more

2090
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:28,480
than somebody who didn't get that extra education.

2091
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,360
In the early years of the Cuban revolution,

2092
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,520
there was a very broad consciousness.

2093
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,240
I think there still is in Cuba

2094
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,520
of a relatively healthy consciousness,

2095
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,840
I would call it on this subject.

2096
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,840
I think before we move on to the more long-term questions,

2097
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,280
long-term questions, actually,

2098
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:52,600
I think it would be important maybe in order to close

2099
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:57,000
the case of the basic elements of Paragon

2100
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,200
to take a closer look at some elements

2101
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,600
we kind of touched upon,

2102
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,480
but haven't yet really talked through.

2103
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,800
One of those would be balanced job complexes

2104
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,520
because this is actually a very important basic principle

2105
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,640
within Paragon as well.

2106
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:19,480
And we haven't actually laid it out in concrete terms,

2107
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,400
I think.

2108
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:25,400
So maybe could you explain what are balanced job complexes

2109
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:30,440
and why do you think that they are a good idea to implement?

2110
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,240
Okay, there's two different issues.

2111
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,360
You can balance jobs in two respects.

2112
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,800
One would be for empowerment

2113
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,920
and the other would be for desirability

2114
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,720
or undesirability, whatever.

2115
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:49,360
So first, let's look at how it is

2116
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,520
that most jobs look in capitalism.

2117
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:55,080
We could also look and see how do most jobs look

2118
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,440
in the centrally planned socialist economies too.

2119
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:02,720
In both cases, what you find is that

2120
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,480
a small percentage of a workplace

2121
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:11,400
have jobs that consists of a number of tasks

2122
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,640
and sort of approximately how many hours a week

2123
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,720
you work in these different tasks.

2124
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:18,320
These are tasks where you're sitting in on meetings,

2125
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:22,360
where you're going over different options

2126
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,440
for what might happen.

2127
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:28,280
Or these would be tasks where you're just,

2128
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:31,680
I used to work in steel mills in the summers

2129
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,920
when I was going to college.

2130
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,920
And they would throw us into the crews

2131
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,560
where we would have to go out

2132
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,240
and underneath the open hearth furnaces,

2133
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:48,240
all of this sort of burnt coal ash would come down.

2134
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:51,080
And at some point the tunnels would fill up

2135
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,640
and you have to send somebody in there

2136
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:55,800
to shovel it out into wheelbarrows.

2137
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:00,800
Rote labor, not pleasant, nothing empowering about it.

2138
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,680
It just made your muscles sore when you went home at night.

2139
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:07,680
So in almost any capitalist workplace you go to

2140
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:12,680
and I think in most of the centrally planned economies,

2141
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:17,840
certainly by the second half of the 20th century,

2142
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:22,280
what you're gonna find is you've got a small number of people

2143
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,480
who do managerial type tasks.

2144
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,600
And then you've got most of the people

2145
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,520
just carrying out somebody's orders,

2146
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,960
doing something that's more or less mind numbing.

2147
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:38,720
Well, clearly some tasks empower people

2148
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:43,720
to be both more knowledgeable about the kinds of decisions

2149
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,600
that have to be made in enterprise

2150
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,120
and to sort of have the skills and habits

2151
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:52,520
to be effective in expressing their opinions on the subject.

2152
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:59,000
So the whole idea that, well, we want our workers councils.

2153
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,600
We're giving everybody one vote.

2154
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:07,880
Ultimately, we're saying at a stockholders meeting

2155
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,440
in a capitalist corporation,

2156
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,120
ultimately you get as many votes

2157
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,600
as you have shares of stock.

2158
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,560
In a workers council, everybody gets one vote.

2159
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:23,240
But if you have some people doing all of these empowering

2160
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:25,840
tasks day in and out and you have other people

2161
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,480
in the workplace doing these rote sort of mindless jobs

2162
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:35,120
day in and day out, then clearly although they have

2163
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:39,600
an equal right to vote in the meetings,

2164
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,680
they aren't gonna arrive at those meetings

2165
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:47,120
sort of equally empowered to be effective in the meetings.

2166
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:53,080
This is something that, I mean, in Yugoslavia,

2167
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,120
we had a 20, 30 year experience

2168
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:00,120
with workers self-management in enterprises.

2169
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:05,160
And one of the very discouraging trends

2170
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,560
was that in the early years,

2171
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,200
there was a lot more active participation

2172
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,360
on the part of a much larger percentage

2173
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,080
of workers in the enterprise.

2174
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:19,080
And as time went on, all the sociological studies

2175
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:22,880
about the activity of the participation declined over time.

2176
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,360
And I think there was a reason for that,

2177
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:30,760
that they didn't balance jobs for empowerment.

2178
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:33,000
They made no particular effort to do that.

2179
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:37,120
So if you really want what I would call

2180
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:41,800
real workplace democracy rather than just formal,

2181
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,880
everybody gets one vote democracy,

2182
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,800
then there's a very strong argument

2183
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,000
that I think socialists should want to see.

2184
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Job descriptions revised so that to the extent

2185
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,800
that it's reasonable and possible,

2186
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,880
you want to include empowering tasks

2187
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,760
along with disempowering tasks

2188
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:03,040
in everybody's job description.

2189
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,360
And does that mean that in a hospital,

2190
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,600
sometimes a surgeon might actually have to spend

2191
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,400
some hours changing bedpans?

2192
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,960
My answer is yes.

2193
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,760
And then we can argue about whether that's

2194
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:19,360
not a very inefficient use of that skilled surgeon's time.

2195
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,280
But any case, so that's what the balancing

2196
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,480
for empowerment about.

2197
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:27,760
It's basically saying if you look at our,

2198
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,600
if you look at both capitalism and state socialism,

2199
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,720
really was a remarkable similarity

2200
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:39,360
in terms of how jobs were structured

2201
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,520
and the fact that some of them,

2202
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,880
a small number of them were rather empowered,

2203
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,880
had the effect of empowering the people

2204
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,720
who carried out those tasks.

2205
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:51,120
And for most people, the effect was to disempower you

2206
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:54,920
in terms of your, in any case.

2207
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:57,640
Now that's a little different from desirability.

2208
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,520
So the argument in favor of empowering for desirability

2209
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:04,000
is that's how you encourage and make sure

2210
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,920
that you don't have an erosion of the exercise

2211
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:12,240
of economic democracy in the workplaces.

2212
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:16,080
Balancing for desirability is an equity issue.

2213
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And there is another way of taking care of that

2214
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,040
and that is the worker's council.

2215
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,600
So, I mean, where does that come from?

2216
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:31,360
Well, why should somebody's job be remarkably,

2217
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:34,640
why should somebody's job be much more unpleasant

2218
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,320
than somebody else's job?

2219
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,440
Where's the justice in that?

2220
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:40,640
So you can put the question simply that way.

2221
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,040
And my answer would be there is no justice in that

2222
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,800
unless there was some compensation.

2223
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:52,400
So that's where there is sort of an alternative way

2224
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:56,160
to take care of the injustice if somebody's job

2225
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,320
has a whole bunch of tasks that are really unpleasant

2226
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,720
and somebody else's job never has any tasks

2227
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:04,920
that are unpleasant, the changing bedpans.

2228
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:09,920
In that case, you could compensate the person

2229
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:14,920
that has the job that is less pleasant to perform.

2230
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:19,600
And you could say that's part of why somebody

2231
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,360
would deserve greater compensation.

2232
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,000
So in that case, there's two ways of taking care of it.

2233
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Our actual proposal is, we basically propose

2234
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,400
consciousness raising amongst workers

2235
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,400
about these issues in their workplace.

2236
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:39,160
And we propose that we think you should set up,

2237
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,200
like we used to, originally we just called them

2238
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,760
effort rating companies.

2239
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,800
We just called them effort rating committees.

2240
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,440
But we were thinking more along the lines

2241
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:50,600
of sort of any differential sacrifice.

2242
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:53,680
And we think you should set up procedures

2243
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:57,680
for trying to balance the tasks and the time people

2244
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,760
are spending in tasks so that you,

2245
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,560
so that you don't have this terrible imbalance

2246
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,520
in terms of the empowerment effects of work life.

2247
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,680
But you obviously are gonna have to go about this

2248
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,520
as you see fit.

2249
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:17,040
So these are what I call injunctions and arguments.

2250
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,800
But the bottom line is, nobody from the outside

2251
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:27,720
is coming in and telling you how you do it.

2252
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:32,200
And if push comes to shove and a workplace,

2253
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,600
a bunch of workplace council and then a workers council

2254
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,080
doesn't wanna do these things,

2255
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:41,240
I would be very loathe to say somehow you get called up

2256
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:45,880
before a tribunal and put on trial for it.

2257
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:48,120
I mean, if you don't do them, you don't do them.

2258
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,680
In our mind, they're part of what socialism should be like

2259
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,640
and should be about.

2260
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:59,760
But we're very libertarian in our anarchist tendencies

2261
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,520
in terms of whether this is something that is imposed

2262
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,560
or this is something that we are talking about

2263
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,400
building a culture for.

2264
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,880
Yeah, and I think at least for me,

2265
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,880
the last statements are very important to me,

2266
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:17,800
I have to say, because I'm not a big fan

2267
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:21,800
of the effort-raiding committees, to be honest,

2268
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:26,800
because I sense the real danger of this becoming real ugly

2269
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:31,680
and creating some form of toxic workplace.

2270
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,680
And I would very much advise

2271
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
anyone to not go this road,

2272
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,880
but I very much appreciate that within Paragon,

2273
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,480
you give this kind of flexibility

2274
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:46,480
in order to approach the things that you recommend

2275
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:49,560
in the terms of, for example, balance,

2276
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:53,040
job complexes or effort-raiding committees.

2277
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,040
But if a worker council does have a different type

2278
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:59,040
of culture within the given worker council

2279
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,960
and wants to do things differently,

2280
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,360
this is absolutely compatible with Paragon

2281
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,080
as such, as I understand it.

2282
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:08,480
Well, there's the largest actual experience

2283
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:13,480
of a group of workplaces trying to apply these principles,

2284
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:17,360
including, and in particular, the job balancing,

2285
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,880
balancing for both empowerment and balancing for,

2286
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,720
you know, for desirability and effort-raiding.

2287
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,280
There was a lot of, you know,

2288
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:33,000
there was a whole network of,

2289
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,320
they were called the Mondragon, it was called the A-Zone,

2290
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,720
and they were called the Mondragon,

2291
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:41,960
not to be confused with the Mondragon cooperatives

2292
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,480
in the Basque region of Spain.

2293
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,080
And I'm not quite sure why they chose,

2294
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:49,840
I think they might've chose the word Mondragon in Winnipeg

2295
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,600
in sort of honor of that,

2296
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,680
but they're very, very different.

2297
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:58,760
And there was a coffee house, a restaurant,

2298
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,080
a radio station, a bicycle repair,

2299
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:06,560
sort of a delivery business.

2300
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,240
And they all were in this sort of,

2301
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:14,120
they all had offices in this sort of building

2302
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:16,120
that they jointly had,

2303
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:20,760
and they very self-consciously tried to operate

2304
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:24,960
their collectives on the basis of paragon principles.

2305
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,800
They did it for about 20 years.

2306
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:33,240
And so I'm aware of debates and discussions

2307
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,680
that went on amongst them.

2308
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:39,720
One of the founders, Paul Burroughs,

2309
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:41,320
has gone on to do some other things,

2310
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,560
but he now is,

2311
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:46,400
he's now been active back on the forum

2312
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:49,640
on the participatoryeconomy.org website,

2313
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:52,120
discussing exactly this thing.

2314
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,800
Because it is one of the things

2315
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:56,520
that has been most controversial.

2316
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:02,520
And I can say that what Mondragon ended up doing

2317
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:06,720
was not really trying to do

2318
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:10,520
any sort of detailed effort rating.

2319
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,960
They argued about it a lot.

2320
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,200
It was quite controversial.

2321
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:20,760
And they ended up saying,

2322
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,800
no, it's gonna come down to hours.

2323
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:28,640
And if there's a real problem with just,

2324
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:31,400
you're not putting in effort,

2325
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:34,840
then it's an issue of firing,

2326
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,880
it's an issue of the rest of us saying,

2327
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,080
this is just too detrimental to the rest of us.

2328
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,640
You either have to ship up or you have to shape up

2329
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,560
or you really shouldn't be working here anymore.

2330
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:49,000
Rather than sort of having an effort rating committee

2331
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,720
where at the end of every six months or so.

2332
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,960
So I know that's what they came up with.

2333
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:00,640
I am sure that, here's my dilemma.

2334
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,120
My dilemma is the following.

2335
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:05,880
Those of us who are even talking about it,

2336
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:10,560
we've already decided that we're leftists and we're socialists.

2337
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:15,720
And therefore, we don't think it should be necessary

2338
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:19,040
to get into this kind of invidious comparisons.

2339
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:24,240
And we would just find it toxic.

2340
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:28,400
And my answer to all of us is I have two,

2341
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,600
and I have two things to say about that.

2342
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,800
Just like you, when I go to search for a worker's council

2343
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,200
to work for in a participatory economy,

2344
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:41,480
I will look for one that adopts that attitude

2345
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,560
toward effort rating.

2346
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:48,000
Because that'll make me happiest there.

2347
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,480
I mean, one of the things that people should look at,

2348
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,680
I mean, people do this in capitalism.

2349
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:55,480
They look to see, well, what's your pay structure

2350
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,840
and how are you gonna, when can I first put in

2351
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:00,040
for a promotion?

2352
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:04,560
So I think one of the things that people will sensibly look

2353
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,240
at in a participatory economy when they decide

2354
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:09,200
where they want to apply to a workplace is

2355
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,240
to look and see what is the workplace's procedures

2356
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:14,560
in this regard or the ones I would like

2357
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,000
or the ones I would feel comfortable with or not.

2358
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,480
But here's my dilemma.

2359
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,440
I talk to people who would not be comfortable

2360
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,720
in a work environment where they think

2361
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:27,680
that people who don't work as hard

2362
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,960
are gonna get just as rewarded as they are.

2363
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:35,160
And I know that they would want some sort of procedures

2364
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:40,160
where slackers would be identified by fellow workers

2365
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:45,680
and would be told, look, it's okay

2366
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,280
if you don't wanna work as hard.

2367
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,640
But please recognize that that means

2368
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,840
you shouldn't be rewarded quite as much.

2369
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,160
So that's another issue.

2370
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:58,040
And the usual way of handling this,

2371
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,440
I mean, the way it was always handled

2372
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:02,720
in the Soviet Union was everybody should be working

2373
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,480
harder than anybody can imagine.

2374
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:12,120
And I mean, I grew up as an, I grew up

2375
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:16,440
as enough of a hippie to know that is insane.

2376
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,840
That's not a good life.

2377
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:24,600
So there's nothing wrong with somebody saying,

2378
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:27,200
hey, you wanna go out there and bust your hump?

2379
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,760
That's fine.

2380
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:30,080
I don't have to do that.

2381
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,320
I don't wanna, I don't choose to do that.

2382
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,920
On the other hand, I think one should concede

2383
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,960
that if somebody else is making more sacrifices

2384
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:44,320
then they deserve some degree of extra compensation

2385
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,440
that's commensurate with that.

2386
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:48,920
And it is my personal choice.

2387
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,480
So I wanna give people the,

2388
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,560
I wanna preserve personal choice

2389
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:56,520
over how much effort people put into work.

2390
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,840
But I think there's a responsible way to do that,

2391
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:05,840
which is I choose more, I mean, we know there's a sort

2392
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,280
of choose between leisure and income,

2393
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,440
who we think of it as in terms of hours.

2394
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:13,560
You can also choose between leisurely pace of work

2395
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:15,080
and income.

2396
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:17,040
There's no reason people shouldn't make,

2397
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,280
people should have the right to choose that.

2398
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,000
They make that choice for themselves.

2399
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,400
Why not?

2400
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:25,120
There's nothing socially irresponsible about saying

2401
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:27,160
I want a more leisurely pace of work,

2402
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,240
but my more leisurely pace of work,

2403
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:34,200
I think basically entitles me to what I'm saying is

2404
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,440
I want that more leisurely pace of work.

2405
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:39,280
And yes, I accept somewhat less compensation

2406
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:42,800
for the fact that it's not as big a sacrifice

2407
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,200
as somebody else is making.

2408
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:48,000
So that's where that all has landed.

2409
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,160
In the end, we leave it up to workers councils.

2410
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,080
We recommend that people take that into consideration.

2411
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,440
When you decide where to apply to work,

2412
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,400
you wanna go to work someplace

2413
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,280
where they have the same values on that,

2414
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:04,120
where they've come to the same set of values on that subject

2415
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:06,800
that you feel that you're comfortable with.

2416
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,480
But I do know that there are people out there

2417
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,920
who are very loathe to think that this system

2418
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:15,520
would be a good system that they would be happy in.

2419
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:18,360
If they imagine themselves working in a place

2420
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:21,720
where they work hard and other people don't,

2421
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:24,800
and the other people get away with it

2422
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,720
and get paid the same as them.

2423
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:30,560
And they find that something, I don't like that system.

2424
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:33,320
And I think there's a point to be made there too.

2425
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,280
I also think there's a real bias.

2426
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:38,480
Those of us who even talk about this

2427
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:43,400
clearly are more inclined to don't wanna get into it.

2428
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:44,920
People will be responsible.

2429
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:46,600
And if they're really irresponsible,

2430
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:50,280
then you admonish them in some sort of way.

2431
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:52,280
You give them a warning and finally you just say,

2432
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:54,080
well, you just don't wanna,

2433
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:56,040
the rest of us don't wanna work with you.

2434
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,880
But I think that there's a real,

2435
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:01,680
I think that leftists are predictably farther

2436
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:04,360
in that direction than your average person out there

2437
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,080
in the population that we talk to

2438
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:08,160
about different economic systems.

2439
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:11,560
Cause I know this reaction to the students in my classes.

2440
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:13,800
Cause students in my classes are basically

2441
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:16,560
the average US population in some sense.

2442
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,720
They're, a tiny percentage of them are leftists.

2443
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:25,120
And I know from their reaction over the years,

2444
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:29,840
they find it comforting that there'd be procedures

2445
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:33,000
to distinguish between people who are working hard

2446
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,400
and people who aren't.

2447
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:38,600
Yeah, I think I subsumed this also somehow

2448
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,360
under the question of transition,

2449
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:42,480
because the way that you approach it

2450
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:45,880
by providing a plurality of approaches

2451
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:50,880
to different people who might be in a different

2452
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:54,520
state of mind towards these questions

2453
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:59,520
so that they can build it in a way that works for them

2454
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:00,920
for the moment.

2455
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:05,600
I mean, this also includes some danger, of course,

2456
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:09,400
in the sense that it might lead to structures

2457
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:13,040
that reproduce this kind of thinking

2458
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:14,800
that you just described from your students,

2459
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:18,640
this kind of like a bit greedy and competitive type

2460
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:22,240
of behavior of thinking about one another.

2461
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:25,480
And there's this danger of like reproducing this

2462
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:28,880
by producing institutions and structures

2463
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:33,840
within a given workers council that, as I said,

2464
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,920
produces this kind of thinking as well.

2465
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:39,800
But as I said, I absolutely appreciate this plurality

2466
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:44,800
and my vote would go out for not like going down the road

2467
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,840
of effort-raiding committees.

2468
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:51,920
And also in terms of sacrifice and effort,

2469
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:54,520
I find it very difficult to really evaluate

2470
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:58,280
whether or not someone is putting in effort or not,

2471
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:01,840
because this could look very differently

2472
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:03,920
for a different type of person.

2473
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,480
And at some point within your newest book,

2474
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:10,480
you also write, but are people equally able to sacrifice

2475
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:12,960
or is it easier for some to make sacrifices

2476
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,800
than it is for others, just as it is easier

2477
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:18,960
for some to perform difficult and valuable physical

2478
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:21,840
or mental tasks than it is for others?

2479
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:24,800
And then you state questions such as these make me happy.

2480
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,320
I'm not a philosopher.

2481
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:29,840
What can one say except perhaps, end quote.

2482
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,520
And I would add to this, perhaps I would say for sure,

2483
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:37,920
I'm quite sure that it is actually impossible

2484
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:41,000
to really evaluate whether someone is putting in effort

2485
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,920
and not, and to some people it comes more naturally

2486
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:47,160
at different things and to others not.

2487
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,200
So I would actually be kind of skeptical,

2488
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:54,240
but as I said, I highly appreciate this flexibility

2489
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:56,280
within your approach.

2490
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:57,280
So-

2491
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,080
There's actually a very active debate

2492
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:03,400
amongst the collective that manages the,

2493
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,920
actually one of the two brothers

2494
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:08,480
who are the most active managers of the website.

2495
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:13,240
Jason raised that on the discussion forum

2496
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:15,680
and said that he thinks that there's a discussion

2497
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,920
about whether we should stop using the word effort

2498
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:19,480
in this regard.

2499
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:23,040
Yeah, but it's not an easy issue.

2500
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:25,120
It's not an easy issue.

2501
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:29,000
And it is one that people care tremendously about.

2502
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:31,960
And it's also one where you don't,

2503
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:34,240
it's also one where, I mean, when we're starting

2504
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:37,560
to talk about opportunity costs and social costs,

2505
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:40,960
and whether a planning mechanism will do this or that,

2506
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:43,800
well, I mean, there it requires some expertise.

2507
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:46,800
This isn't any subject that anybody feels

2508
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,120
requires any expertise they don't have,

2509
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:55,080
which I always appreciate a subject where everybody thinks

2510
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:58,920
that they are equally equipped to argue and debate,

2511
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:02,200
and their view is just as valid as anybody else.

2512
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:05,040
I think it's lucky when we have a subject

2513
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,080
where everybody thinks that way about it.

2514
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,040
And I think this is one of those subjects.

2515
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:12,880
Everybody has a very firm opinion

2516
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,680
about what they think is fair and not fair

2517
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:16,560
in terms of economic compensation.

2518
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:18,920
Interesting.

2519
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:22,320
One question that I have in the back of my mind

2520
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:25,240
all of the time when you're talking about

2521
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:28,640
like the ways in which these workers councils

2522
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,760
are organized internally,

2523
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:35,760
how you might achieve self-management and so on and so forth

2524
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:37,920
is the question of scaling.

2525
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:42,920
So how big can these councils actually become

2526
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:46,640
in order to stay true to these principles

2527
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:49,440
that you would like to see being enacted

2528
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,680
within these worker councils?

2529
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,480
Because people who have experiences

2530
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,640
with self-organized structures,

2531
02:11:56,640 --> 02:12:01,240
they might know that this is very much difficult.

2532
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:03,760
It's very, very difficult to achieve

2533
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:06,520
like organizations of scale

2534
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:11,520
that are actually really true to principles

2535
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:13,840
that Perikan tries to promote.

2536
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:18,080
So how do you think about this question of scale?

2537
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:22,640
The simple answer is we're agnostic on that subject.

2538
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,200
But that doesn't mean,

2539
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:28,160
there seem to be some things

2540
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:32,840
that clearly the smaller the workers council,

2541
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:37,080
the easier it is for people,

2542
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:40,240
for everybody to participate in all aspects.

2543
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:42,760
So you can ask yourself,

2544
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:45,160
is there an optimal size

2545
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,400
just in terms of how would

2546
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:50,640
participatory democratic decision-making procedures

2547
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:52,000
function best?

2548
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:59,040
Obviously from a technology production side,

2549
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,080
there's also issues about scale.

2550
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,920
And here there's a useful difference.

2551
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:09,920
I mean, economists talk about true economies of scale,

2552
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,120
which can be distinguished

2553
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:15,800
from financial economies of scale.

2554
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:20,960
So in a capitalist economy,

2555
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:23,920
there are frequently advantages of being larger,

2556
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:26,680
like being an oligopoly or a monopoly even.

2557
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:31,360
Not necessarily because the technology dictates it.

2558
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,320
So we wouldn't want workers councils

2559
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:41,120
to become large for what in capitalism

2560
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:43,680
would be financial economies of scale reasons.

2561
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:46,640
But in terms of social costs

2562
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:48,600
and lowest social cost of production,

2563
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:51,400
there are true economies of scale

2564
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:57,200
where probably the efficient size

2565
02:13:57,200 --> 02:14:01,280
for a workers council producing steel

2566
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:04,720
is different from the efficient size

2567
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:09,200
for a workers council that's a haircut salon.

2568
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,440
So when I said we're agnostic,

2569
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,720
we just, we recognize all that.

2570
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,080
And we don't think, I mean,

2571
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:20,360
so suppose you have a workers council

2572
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:23,760
where true economies of scale are significant.

2573
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,040
And so we're really talking about an enterprise

2574
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:31,040
that makes sense that has a couple of thousand members.

2575
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,720
Well, then you clearly would have to sort of,

2576
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:37,840
you're going to have different divisions.

2577
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,840
I mean, something that large is going to have different,

2578
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:44,560
I mean, in a steel mill, there was the blast furnace,

2579
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,880
there's the open hearth furnace,

2580
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,840
there's the warehouses,

2581
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:53,320
there's the sheet metal cutting places.

2582
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:55,640
So there's all these sort of divisions.

2583
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:58,520
And in a large enterprise,

2584
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:03,520
you would want to have sort of sub worker councils,

2585
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,760
for the different divisions.

2586
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:09,480
There's a whole bunch of decisions in the blast furnace area

2587
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:13,360
that really don't affect the rest of the plant that much.

2588
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:16,320
But it seems like that, I mean, so that is our approach.

2589
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:19,920
That would be the sensible way to approach that.

2590
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:24,400
The only thing that should not come into play

2591
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:27,000
are in capitalist economies,

2592
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,800
financial economies of scale,

2593
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:33,800
sometimes give you extra market power advantages.

2594
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:36,720
And that's why a firm will get that big.

2595
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:41,720
And certainly, and we don't think that any workers council,

2596
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:48,960
Mondragon set up operations in China.

2597
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:53,600
And the Chinese operation was not self-managed

2598
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:57,680
by Chinese workers at the Mondragon place in China.

2599
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:04,120
So that's for both, that you can't have.

2600
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,520
So you're not, I mean,

2601
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:12,520
a lot of the world's large corporations are now global.

2602
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:15,200
And so we're not talking about that at all.

2603
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,600
None of these worker councils

2604
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:19,600
are operating outside of the country.

2605
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:23,960
In general, so there would not be any-

2606
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:26,680
Well, they can export, they can import.

2607
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,400
I mean, there's a chapter in the last,

2608
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,120
in democratic economic planning

2609
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:34,480
that addresses the sort of new practical issue.

2610
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:40,400
There was a point in time when socialists thought that

2611
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:43,920
when socialism finally came to power any place,

2612
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,800
the idea was gonna be so obviously wonderful

2613
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,120
that the workers were gonna revolt every place

2614
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:52,560
and we were gonna have socialism everywhere.

2615
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:56,400
Even Lenin thought there were gonna be revolutions

2616
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:58,360
in Germany and Europe,

2617
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:02,240
and that they weren't gonna have an isolated Soviet Union.

2618
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:04,560
And Trotskyists for a long time argued

2619
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:08,040
that you really can't have socialism in one country.

2620
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:09,680
Well, it's apparent now

2621
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:12,560
that if we can't have socialism in one country at a time,

2622
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:13,640
we're never gonna have it,

2623
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:16,880
because at this point in the 20th century,

2624
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:19,560
it's very clear to me that it's highly unlikely

2625
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:20,880
that we aren't gonna have,

2626
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,720
who knows what country it's going to be,

2627
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:28,240
but countries are gonna try and become socialist

2628
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:30,560
in a world where there are still huge differences

2629
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:32,760
in levels of economic development

2630
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:35,520
and where a lot of the countries are capitalist countries

2631
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:36,840
that they have to interact with.

2632
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:39,200
And then the question is, how do you interact?

2633
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,640
So we finally address that in the most recent book,

2634
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:43,400
we'd never talked about it before,

2635
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:47,400
and sort of proposed how could a socialist,

2636
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:49,560
a country with a socialist economy

2637
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:51,360
take part in international trade

2638
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,960
in a way that was beneficial to them,

2639
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:55,760
but didn't violate their fundamental principles

2640
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:59,240
in some way that eroded the sort of moral

2641
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:02,040
and political glue that held their system together.

2642
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:04,840
And we basically said,

2643
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:06,120
the one thing that's ruled out

2644
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:07,600
is direct foreign investment.

2645
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,960
You can't allow a capitalist firm coming

2646
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:13,200
and come into a participatory economy

2647
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:14,840
and set up a capitalist,

2648
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:16,520
engage in direct foreign investment,

2649
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:20,360
run as a capitalist firm inside the socialist economy.

2650
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,240
And we said, we don't think workers councils

2651
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:23,960
in the socialist economy

2652
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:27,640
can basically do direct foreign investment abroad.

2653
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:30,760
But we do think that there's no reason

2654
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:32,240
that a participatory economy

2655
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,280
couldn't trade with the rest of the world,

2656
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:37,440
including trading with capitalist countries

2657
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:40,960
and including taking into account dramatic differences

2658
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:42,600
in levels of economic development

2659
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:44,200
in terms of the terms of trade.

2660
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,080
And even international financial investment

2661
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:50,240
is something we think is possible

2662
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:54,800
for a participatory economy to engage in.

2663
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,520
And a participatory economy could engage

2664
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,520
in international financial investment,

2665
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:00,440
both outgoing and ingoing.

2666
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:03,560
It's a question of how you treat the interest rate.

2667
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:05,600
And with certain partners,

2668
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,920
you have to treat the interest rate differently.

2669
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:09,520
But that's not something that wasn't discussed.

2670
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:11,120
I mean, there was a huge discussion

2671
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:14,680
in Cuba used to lecture the Soviet Union

2672
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:16,880
and the Eastern European economies

2673
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:19,160
about the morality of the difference

2674
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:21,640
between being a lesser developed country

2675
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:23,480
and a more developed country.

2676
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:25,680
I mean, Che Guevara was famous for just saying,

2677
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:28,440
well, we assume that your socialist principles

2678
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:31,760
will help you understand

2679
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,640
why you should afford favorable terms of trade

2680
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:37,920
towards your brother socialist Cuban economy.

2681
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:42,680
Now, to some extent, the Soviet Union did do that,

2682
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:46,640
but more for geopolitical purposes

2683
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:48,800
than commitments to socialist principles.

2684
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,800
But in any case, this isn't something

2685
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,560
that hasn't been discussed before.

2686
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:58,400
But I do think that amongst socialist in 2020,

2687
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:00,840
that discussion now has to be,

2688
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:03,400
we now have a new perspective realism

2689
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:07,560
about how socialism will eventually come to the world.

2690
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:09,520
It'll come a little here and a little there.

2691
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:10,920
And there's a long period of time

2692
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:13,360
where you have to have some sensible answers

2693
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:16,320
to how do those countries interact and economic,

2694
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:20,920
how do they engage in economic interactions

2695
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:21,880
with other countries?

2696
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:24,040
You've got to have a more sensible discussion of that

2697
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:25,440
than we've ever had before.

2698
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:30,440
That was our show for today.

2699
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:34,240
