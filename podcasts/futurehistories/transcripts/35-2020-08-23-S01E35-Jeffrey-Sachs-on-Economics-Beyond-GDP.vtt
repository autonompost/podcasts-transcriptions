00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and my guest today is the economist Jeffrey Sachs.

00:07.360 --> 00:15.280
I recorded this interview during last year's Globe Art Academy and I hesitated to release it for mainly two reasons.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.320
The first one is that this interview came about more or less spontaneously

00:20.320 --> 00:24.960
and I wasn't able to prepare myself as much as I usually do.

00:25.040 --> 00:32.640
I also like spontaneous interviews, don't get me wrong, but in most cases I like to come prepared.

00:32.640 --> 00:39.360
This was one of those cases and so this was a minus on my part actually.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.240
And the second reason I didn't release the interview yet is that it's not complete.

00:44.240 --> 00:51.760
Mr Sachs was kind enough to lend me his time immediately before his keynote speech at the Globe Art Academy

00:51.840 --> 00:56.720
and then time ran out and we had to stop the interview before getting to some of the more

00:56.720 --> 01:02.880
delicate questions in my notes. And I say delicate because Mr Sachs is a many-sided person

01:02.880 --> 01:07.680
and I would have loved to get to better understand how these different sides fit together.

01:08.240 --> 01:14.160
Just to give you an example, Mr Sachs was an advisor to Yanis Varoufakis during his time as

01:14.160 --> 01:20.080
Greek Finance Minister and he endorsed Bernie Sanders as the Democrat presidential candidate,

01:20.080 --> 01:25.920
which surely was a great help to the movement since Mr Sachs is an important figure in economics

01:25.920 --> 01:32.320
and many try to frame Bernie Sanders' approach as specifically economically unreasonable,

01:32.320 --> 01:41.120
which of course isn't true, but in these cases it of course helps to be endorsed by a person such as

01:41.120 --> 01:48.160
Mr Sachs. On the other side, Mr Sachs was also at least partly responsible for what is called a

01:48.160 --> 01:53.920
shock therapy approach and the economic liberalization of former communist countries

01:53.920 --> 02:00.640
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This arguably has a big part in oligarchic structures

02:00.640 --> 02:07.120
within these economies today and it would have been very interesting to ask the Jeffrey Sachs of

02:07.120 --> 02:13.920
2019 whether or not he would have done things differently given his views on politics and

02:13.920 --> 02:21.200
economics today. Unfortunately, we didn't get to this part, but nonetheless we covered a lot of

02:21.200 --> 02:27.760
interesting and important ground, so thanks a lot to the Globe Art Academy for making this interview

02:27.760 --> 02:35.120
possible and my warmest greetings to everybody at the Globe Art team. Before we get to the interview,

02:35.120 --> 02:41.680
I wanted to welcome Simona and the person with the pseudonym Monster aus dem Loch as Patreons.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.560
Thank you so much for your support and since one of the questions during today's episode is

02:48.560 --> 02:54.560
directed towards the possibility of different kinds of political economies, I wanted to point

02:54.560 --> 03:02.800
you all towards episodes 31 and 32 of Future Histories with radical economist Daniel E.

03:02.800 --> 03:09.280
Sarros as a guest. In these two episodes we take a deep dive into Daniel Sarros' book

03:09.280 --> 03:14.720
Information Technology and Socialist Construction, which I highly recommend when

03:14.720 --> 03:20.960
it comes to the question of how fundamentally different political economies could actually

03:20.960 --> 03:27.040
look like. But now please enjoy today's episode with Jeffrey Sachs.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.760
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and my guest today is Jeffrey Sachs,

03:37.760 --> 03:41.280
economist, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University,

03:41.840 --> 03:46.800
special advisor to the United Nations, secretary general and one of the world's leading experts

03:46.800 --> 03:50.880
on economic development. Welcome Mr. Sachs. Thank you, great to be with you.

03:52.080 --> 03:58.160
Mr. Sachs, all too often political actions are justified by economic parameters such as the GDP,

03:58.160 --> 04:03.280
for example, the gross domestic product. Yet these numbers do not represent the actual

04:03.280 --> 04:09.520
well-being of humans, animals, the ecological environment or anything as such, as well as it

04:09.520 --> 04:15.200
doesn't factor in the future well-being of any of these. So I'd say it's high time for different

04:15.200 --> 04:20.960
parameters to measure our actions against what could those be and what to do about the things

04:20.960 --> 04:29.760
that cannot be measured but are equally important. We do indeed in almost all countries follow the

04:29.760 --> 04:38.720
indicator of gross domestic product and I happened as a young student to be a student of

04:38.720 --> 04:46.480
then emeritus, a very senior, very wonderful professor, Simon Kuznets, who invented the gross

04:46.480 --> 04:55.760
domestic product. He developed it between 1919 and the 1930s when he came up with this concept

04:55.760 --> 05:04.720
and won a Nobel Prize for it. But he always used to emphasize this is not a measure of our well-being.

05:04.720 --> 05:11.120
This is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a measure of the market transactions taking

05:11.120 --> 05:19.120
place in an economy. It's useful to know it was originally designed to help governments plan,

05:19.200 --> 05:27.040
interestingly, to help them plan for two purposes. One, for war because in a war governments need to

05:27.040 --> 05:35.280
requisition resources and for war planning they need to know how big the economy is and how to

05:35.280 --> 05:44.720
mobilize those resources. It also then became used starting in the 1930s for macroeconomic policies

05:45.680 --> 05:54.640
to fight depressions, to fight the contractions of a business cycle. It became part of macroeconomics,

05:54.640 --> 06:04.560
the field invented by John Maynard Keynes. It was not then and until today, not now, a measure of

06:05.120 --> 06:12.720
whether the economy is serving the people, whether it is promoting well-being, whether it is

06:12.800 --> 06:19.680
protecting or destroying the environment, whether it is promoting or taking away from longevity.

06:20.240 --> 06:28.560
In other words, a tremendous amount is missed from this indicator. But crazily enough, it is

06:28.560 --> 06:37.680
probably the most watched number in any economy by the business sector and by the broad public

06:38.320 --> 06:46.080
in almost any place in the entire world. So that's the long answer to your question,

06:46.080 --> 06:56.160
do we need a new measure? Absolutely. We need measures that track whether what we want out

06:56.160 --> 07:05.120
of an economy, ability of people to meet their needs, the ability of people to live with comfort

07:05.120 --> 07:12.560
and safety and dignity, the safety and sustainability of the natural environment,

07:13.280 --> 07:21.520
the quality of our lives, the quality of our society in terms of trust, the functionality

07:21.520 --> 07:29.680
of our governments in terms of honesty, competence or corruption. We need measures because those are

07:29.680 --> 07:38.160
all important. And when you follow one measure to the exclusion of the other measures, you follow

07:39.200 --> 07:46.720
or you pull, I should say, your economy and society right over a cliff. If you're following

07:46.720 --> 07:55.360
a wrong goal, just maximize GDP. Of course, we're going to destroy the environment.

07:55.360 --> 08:02.320
We're going to put favor of the mega wealth over the fairness of the society.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.880
We're going to privilege things that are sold on markets, not things that are

08:07.680 --> 08:17.040
non-markets such as our leisure time, our time with children, our own time for learning and so on.

08:17.920 --> 08:24.400
So you follow the wrong measure, you pursue the wrong goals. It's as simple as that. And that's

08:24.400 --> 08:29.920
why we need better goals and better measures for the things that are really important.

08:30.800 --> 08:36.640
What could those be? Are there actually models that take all these things into account? Is there a

08:38.800 --> 08:42.080
good way of approaching this that already has been established?

08:42.720 --> 08:52.400
There is a worldwide movement, sometimes under the rubric beyond GDP, because it is really about

08:52.400 --> 09:01.440
measurement other than GDP that is trying to answer your question. What should we be measuring?

09:02.800 --> 09:13.360
There's one idea which I rather like and pursue, in fact, with colleagues, and that is to try to

09:13.360 --> 09:22.160
measure happiness directly. How could you do that? We don't have a galvanometer to put on

09:22.160 --> 09:29.520
your skin to measure how happy you are. So what is done is to ask people about their life satisfaction.

09:30.080 --> 09:37.760
And then I and colleagues and now a whole worldwide industry of researchers

09:38.480 --> 09:45.920
studies how people answer the question, are you satisfied with your life? Or on a scale from zero

09:45.920 --> 09:53.520
to 10, where would you place your life from the worst to the best? The answers to that question

09:53.520 --> 10:00.480
are very, very informative, even predictive of how people are going to vote, whether they support

10:01.440 --> 10:08.880
populism, whether they are suffering, because an answer to that question also is often very revealing

10:08.880 --> 10:17.120
of the mental illness or depression of people and so forth. One learns a lot about society from

10:17.840 --> 10:25.120
looking at the changes over time in the answer to that question. In the United States, for example,

10:25.680 --> 10:32.880
where that question has been asked for decades, we have seen over the last 15 years a significant

10:32.880 --> 10:42.000
fall in the response to the measure of well-being. And it seems pretty clear that

10:42.000 --> 10:48.960
Americans, my own country, are feeling worse and worse about many things. And so that is an important

10:48.960 --> 10:57.280
indicator. The OECD, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the club of

10:57.280 --> 11:04.960
the high-income democracies, Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and a few other

11:04.960 --> 11:17.760
countries, has been pursuing a broader range of measures that are measures about quality of

11:18.400 --> 11:24.320
the environment, measures about the work-life balance, leisure time,

11:24.960 --> 11:34.400
measures about the quality of jobs, the safety of the work environment, the job satisfaction.

11:35.200 --> 11:42.800
So they have come up with actually dozens of indicators. And what the OECD

11:43.760 --> 11:52.080
staff says is, here are your indicators. They're all online. You can put the way to aggregate them

11:52.080 --> 11:57.680
according to your own values. So we won't give you the weights to add up across all those different

11:57.680 --> 12:02.480
dimensions. That's something for you to do. If you think that the most important issue

12:02.480 --> 12:07.760
is leisure time, or you think the most important issue is life expectancy, or you think the most

12:07.840 --> 12:14.240
important issue is the environment, well, take the indicators and you make your own

12:14.240 --> 12:22.320
weighting. But their idea is that we don't know how to add. So we have to use our two eyes,

12:22.320 --> 12:29.600
our two hands, our toes, our fingers to look at 20 or 30 indicators rather than just one or two

12:29.600 --> 12:36.000
indicators. I think that has a lot of merit also. Now, there's another way that I work on,

12:36.720 --> 12:49.280
which is to take into account that back in 2015, all 193 governments in the United Nations

12:49.280 --> 12:58.480
unanimously adopted the sustainable development goals. These are 17 goals that in principle,

12:58.480 --> 13:05.280
at least, are shared by all countries of the world. They include ending poverty, ending hunger,

13:06.080 --> 13:13.920
promoting health, ensuring that all children of school age are in school, gender equality,

13:14.800 --> 13:23.200
safe water and sanitation, renewable energy access, decent jobs, good infrastructure,

13:24.080 --> 13:32.400
low income inequality, sustainable cities, circular economy that cuts

13:32.400 --> 13:42.000
waste, control of climate change, protection of oceans, protection of land, ecosystems,

13:43.920 --> 13:48.720
the rule of law and global partnerships. Now, if you were counting carefully,

13:48.720 --> 13:55.280
you would have seen that I named 17 SDGs. Those are, and I know them because it's my job at the

13:55.280 --> 14:03.040
UN to help advise how to achieve those 17. So, another thought that I very much subscribe to,

14:03.040 --> 14:11.280
because I think these goals are very important, is to examine how the 193 countries of the world

14:11.280 --> 14:18.400
are faring, whether they're making progress to achieve those goals or whether they're going

14:18.400 --> 14:24.480
backwards or whether they're just treading water that they're neither going forward nor backward.

14:25.040 --> 14:34.080
So, my colleagues and I at the UN produce each year what we call the SDG index. That is a single

14:34.080 --> 14:44.480
number or a ranking which says if you take all 17 goals and you measure how each country is

14:44.480 --> 14:52.320
performing on those 17 goals with a score of zero if it's the worst and a score of 100 if it's

14:52.320 --> 14:59.680
achieved the goal and then you add up across the goals, take the average, then you get a score

15:00.400 --> 15:07.360
and we find that some countries, especially in Europe, Austria is doing pretty well,

15:08.560 --> 15:16.320
Scandinavia is doing even better in general, are making good progress towards the SDGs

15:16.400 --> 15:23.280
and some of the poorest countries are in absolute desperate shape and really need the help of the

15:23.280 --> 15:28.240
rich world but typically are not getting much help because our world is not a very generous

15:28.240 --> 15:38.080
world these days. But that SDG index is another approach to your question, how can we measure

15:38.080 --> 15:46.320
what's really valuable in life? That SDG index, if I could summarize it, says that societies have a

15:49.600 --> 15:57.040
three-part objective. They want to be prosperous, they should or they claim to want to be fair

15:57.600 --> 16:03.280
and they want to be environmentally sustainable. So, a high score means that you are both

16:03.280 --> 16:12.160
economically, socially and environmentally on the right track. My own country, the United States,

16:12.160 --> 16:19.600
comes in around 35th in the world on this, a pretty dismal score for such a rich country

16:21.040 --> 16:28.560
and the reason is that the US is quite rich but it is not fair and it is not environmentally

16:28.560 --> 16:35.360
sustainable. So, of those three pillars of sustainable development, the economic pillar,

16:35.360 --> 16:40.960
the social pillar and the environmental pillar, the US does well only on one of them, the economics,

16:40.960 --> 16:47.680
very rich country, very technologically sophisticated country. But Boyer, we unfair

16:47.680 --> 16:54.880
because the gap between the rich and the poor is the highest gap of any high-income country

16:54.960 --> 17:01.120
and of course, we have a crazy president, Donald Trump, who thinks that it's his job to

17:01.680 --> 17:08.560
increase the carbon emissions rather than to decrease the carbon emissions because he is

17:09.760 --> 17:16.800
trying to help the coal, oil and gas industry to make more profits whereas what we know

17:16.800 --> 17:25.840
scientifically is we have to get out of those fossil fuels and move to wind, solar, hydro,

17:25.840 --> 17:33.280
geothermal energy. So, the US scores pretty poorly even though it's a rich country and that

17:33.280 --> 17:41.680
to just add that long description is a good example of the question that you posed. Here is

17:41.680 --> 17:51.360
a country, the US, very rich, very high GDP per person but not achieving the quality of life,

17:51.920 --> 17:58.720
not achieving the protection of the environment, not achieving social justice. So, we want a measure

17:58.720 --> 18:07.680
that says, aha, don't think you're so good. Your quality of life is evidently suffering and the SDG

18:07.680 --> 18:15.760
index has that property that it flashes a warning red light to the United States you're on the wrong

18:15.760 --> 18:25.840
track. And because you're talking about the question of fairness within the United States

18:26.400 --> 18:31.600
but there's another aspect to the question of fairness which would be the international one

18:31.600 --> 18:38.160
because for me at least living in a country like Austria where the social welfare net is at least

18:38.160 --> 18:43.600
kind of working. I mean, it's getting worse but it's kind of working. And internationally seen,

18:43.600 --> 18:50.640
it's of course pretty good. But still, at least for me, it's pretty striking that we are still

18:50.640 --> 18:59.040
living on the backs of others. So, even Scandinavia, which might have a good ranking

18:59.040 --> 19:06.800
within this score system, this kind of leaves out to factor in this fact that the western world is

19:06.800 --> 19:13.360
actually living kind of on the backs of others and there are people dying on the borders,

19:14.240 --> 19:20.880
there are like strong protectionist economic policies and stuff like that. Does that come

19:20.880 --> 19:28.240
into play somehow? When our group, which is called the United Nations Sustainable Development

19:28.240 --> 19:38.720
Solutions Network, makes this SDG index, we have tracked as closely as we can a large number of

19:38.720 --> 19:45.760
what we call spillover effects, exactly the kind of problems that you're talking about.

19:46.400 --> 19:52.480
For example, we may say we're green and environmental because we're using renewable

19:52.560 --> 19:59.760
energy. But the products that we're buying from China or from other countries are produced with

19:59.760 --> 20:08.320
fossil fuels. So, what we did was we shifted the production to other places and we don't count that

20:08.320 --> 20:18.880
as part of our own effect on the environment. Or when we buy soybeans or buy meat that is coming

20:18.880 --> 20:27.520
from Brazil and those soybeans are being produced on the fringe of the Amazon and contributing to

20:27.520 --> 20:33.600
the deforestation and the forest fires that are underway, we wouldn't see that in our own

20:33.600 --> 20:42.960
consumption but it's a very real effect. Or when we purchase a product and it has been produced with

20:43.600 --> 20:50.080
bonded labor or child labor or slave labor, like the cobalt that's used in the batteries of

20:50.080 --> 20:56.480
every one of our smartphones around the world coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo,

20:56.480 --> 21:04.720
the DRC, and we know horrendous work conditions there, we don't take that into account.

21:05.840 --> 21:11.680
The phone manufacturers say, well, that's not me, that's cobalt, I just buy it as an input.

21:11.680 --> 21:17.840
But that is a direct effect. Now, some of the adverse effects are even starker than that.

21:19.760 --> 21:27.600
Every two or three years, we have a scandal erupt because someone leaks the data on

21:28.720 --> 21:37.680
the Panama files or the other tax havens or New York banks are shown to have been involved in the

21:37.680 --> 21:47.280
mega-corruption in Malaysia and so forth. And these are treated then as, oh my God,

21:47.280 --> 21:52.000
how did that happen? But of course, what we really know is that the tax cheating

21:52.640 --> 21:57.760
and the secrecy is the system, it's not the exception. It is the way the system works.

21:57.760 --> 22:07.360
There are tens of trillions of dollars that in the electronic ledgers are kept in the Caribbean

22:07.360 --> 22:14.960
tax havens, even when there are almost no people in those countries, because under the law, which

22:14.960 --> 22:22.160
is pretty lawless, those places don't charge taxes on the mega-rich. We've just had data

22:22.160 --> 22:28.640
come out in the United States in the last few days that the billionaires now are paying less

22:28.640 --> 22:38.720
than the working class in the most recent tax year. And the billionaires use these tax havens.

22:40.080 --> 22:48.400
Even more direct effects, of course, are when the US or Sweden or others sell armaments to

22:49.440 --> 22:56.560
the Middle East that then end up killing people in Yemen or killing people in Syria or killing

22:56.560 --> 23:02.400
people in Afghanistan and so forth. That is a pretty direct spillover effect that comes out of

23:03.440 --> 23:10.240
the bay of a bomber. It kills a lot of people. So we try to measure those spillovers. That's

23:10.240 --> 23:15.120
one of the reasons why the rich countries definitely are not scored as achieving

23:15.120 --> 23:24.400
the sustainable development goals. And one of the key alleged planks, self-declared planks,

23:24.400 --> 23:31.920
of the SDGs is SDG 17, partnerships of the rich and the poor countries. But I'd say in general,

23:31.920 --> 23:39.360
the rich countries are pretty lousy partners because they do not really honestly look at what

23:39.360 --> 23:49.520
poor countries need in order to escape from poverty or to escape from the environmental

23:49.520 --> 23:56.480
crisis and so on. Of course, the poor countries need to govern themselves properly, but they have

23:56.480 --> 24:04.240
every right, literally right, to expect that the rich countries will be acting honestly,

24:04.240 --> 24:10.880
fairly, and without all of these dire spillovers. The poor countries also have the right to expect

24:10.880 --> 24:15.920
financial help from the rich countries, but that also comes only in small amounts.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.080
There is a category of spending called official development assistance, sometimes called foreign

24:22.080 --> 24:29.600
aid. That's what governments in the rich countries give to governments in the poor countries. We're

24:29.600 --> 24:36.560
not very generous about that. The total amount of so-called foreign aid or official development

24:36.560 --> 24:45.760
assistance is about one-third of 1% of the income of the rich world. And that's a very

24:46.080 --> 24:56.160
in the United States, it's less than half of that. Well, it's about half, about 0.16 or one-sixth

24:56.160 --> 25:04.960
of 1% of US GDP. So we're really nasty and greedy in not providing help for the poorest people

25:04.960 --> 25:12.000
in the world. Now, here the Scandinavian countries do better. They're providing about 1% of the

25:12.000 --> 25:17.360
national income in development aid. Austria could do much better. It's such a rich,

25:17.920 --> 25:25.680
beautiful country, and it wants people to stay home and not be migrants massively to this country.

25:25.680 --> 25:30.800
But one way to do that is to ensure development in the poor countries so that people have a

25:30.800 --> 25:35.920
future in their own countries. And that does require that the rich countries step up and

25:35.920 --> 25:41.520
help to provide the health care, the education, the infrastructure that makes it possible for

25:41.520 --> 25:46.560
the poorest countries to develop. So that's definitely an area where Austria could do a lot

25:46.560 --> 25:54.800
more. And isn't it a problem that oftentimes when financial aid is given, that it is given

25:56.320 --> 26:04.400
tied to certain obligations? Conditions. Yeah, conditions, oftentimes economic conditions of

26:04.400 --> 26:10.320
privatization, opening the markets in order to let international corporations come into the country

26:10.320 --> 26:19.680
and take over the markets. And yeah. Well, the aid is given for all sorts of reasons

26:20.240 --> 26:29.840
of which fighting poverty is often way down on the list. One reason why aid is given is purely

26:29.840 --> 26:35.280
for military or foreign policy reasons. And often those foreign policy reasons are

26:35.760 --> 26:43.760
a pretty unpleasant ones. The U.S. has a lot of allies that are rather thuggish countries.

26:44.560 --> 26:52.000
Those countries get aid because the U.S. wants those countries as allies. Maybe there's a U.S.

26:52.000 --> 27:00.320
military base there, for example. There's a famous phrase about why aid is being given to

27:01.120 --> 27:09.520
particularly horrible country. And the statement is that the leader is really a son of a bitch.

27:10.160 --> 27:15.760
And the answer is, well, he's a son of a bitch, but he's at least our son of a bitch.

27:16.400 --> 27:22.960
And this is a real problem with foreign aid. Too much of it is about war, the military,

27:23.680 --> 27:31.360
or foreign policy alliances. Conditions on foreign aid that

27:32.560 --> 27:38.480
are conditions that the aid should be used correctly are conditions I believe in. In other

27:38.480 --> 27:46.480
words, if you say, I'm going to help country X to keep the children in school, then putting

27:46.480 --> 27:50.800
the condition that the money we're giving, we want to see the schools and the teachers,

27:50.800 --> 27:55.280
and we want verification, and we're going to audit that program, that's perfectly appropriate

27:55.280 --> 28:02.320
in my view. Because if you give the help for a reason, it should actually be fulfilled.

28:03.200 --> 28:13.840
If the aid is given instead, look at the crisis in the United States with our absolutely dangerous

28:13.840 --> 28:19.360
president, Donald Trump, who's surely the worst president we've ever had in American history.

28:20.320 --> 28:27.760
He's giving aid to Ukraine, we now know, based on the Ukrainian government agreeing to

28:28.880 --> 28:36.320
investigate Donald Trump's political foes. Oh, this is straight corruption in the United States,

28:36.320 --> 28:43.760
so the aid is being used for the political objectives of the president of the United States,

28:44.720 --> 28:50.080
not anything about Ukraine, and not just the objectives of the president of the United States,

28:50.080 --> 28:56.800
absolutely constitutionally illegal objectives. So we're rooting for impeachment, I can say,

28:56.800 --> 29:05.920
just as a parentheses, but the point is that aid gets given for all sorts of reasons. Now,

29:05.920 --> 29:12.240
but let me clear up one important point, because I've been involved in this question for a quarter

29:12.240 --> 29:19.840
century, very intensively, often day to day. Once in a while, aid is given for the right reason,

29:20.560 --> 29:28.240
to fight a disease, to help children in school, to ensure access to safe water and sanitation

29:28.240 --> 29:36.080
and so on. And I just want to assure everybody that when aid is well-intentioned and professionally

29:36.080 --> 29:43.440
directed, it actually works. So the most important point is that development aid

29:43.440 --> 29:48.480
can really help poor people, help them to stay alive, help the children to get vaccinated,

29:48.480 --> 29:54.560
help the mothers to survive childbirth, help to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and many other

29:54.560 --> 30:01.440
incredibly important, wonderful things. And it can be done honestly and professionally.

30:02.400 --> 30:12.320
So we shouldn't confuse the fact that the likes of Donald Trump or George W. Bush misuse aid

30:12.320 --> 30:18.960
as a general condemnation of the concept of rich countries helping poor countries,

30:18.960 --> 30:26.960
because rich countries have a moral obligation and a practical need to help poor countries.

30:26.960 --> 30:34.400
We don't want a world of instability, of starvation, of mass force migration. And

30:34.400 --> 30:41.600
when we're serious about it, which our governments are too infrequently serious,

30:42.400 --> 30:45.840
but when we are serious about it, the aid can actually work.

30:47.360 --> 30:52.560
One of the things that I'm arguing for in this podcast is the need for a plurality of political

30:52.640 --> 30:58.080
economies. This brings up a couple of problems and open questions, of course. One of these

30:58.080 --> 31:03.040
problems is the repression of alternatives when it comes to the political economy on a national

31:03.040 --> 31:09.120
level. At least from my perspective, it seems as if the moment a movement comes into power that

31:09.120 --> 31:15.280
wants to do things substantially different, and Syriza and Greece would be an example for this,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.960
then there are very effective mechanisms in place that are able to prevent this from succeeding.

31:21.680 --> 31:26.240
First of all, I'd like to know if you would agree with this assessment. I guess Venezuela

31:26.240 --> 31:32.560
would be a second contemporary example. Allende in Chile in the 70s would be a historical third,

31:32.560 --> 31:37.840
but the list goes on and on. So first of all, I'd like to know if you'd agree. And if yes,

31:37.840 --> 31:43.280
could you explain to us some of the mechanisms, the toolkits that are being used in order to

31:43.280 --> 31:48.800
prevent this plurality of approaches towards political economy from happening?

31:48.800 --> 31:57.760
Well, it's a little bit complicated because if you take the case of Greece, for example,

31:58.800 --> 32:09.680
the fact of the matter is Greece largely got itself into a mega crisis. The governments

32:09.680 --> 32:17.120
in Greece borrowed too much in the first decade of this century, ran up big budget deficits.

32:17.440 --> 32:24.080
Then the financial crisis came, and oh my God, they owed so much they couldn't repay.

32:24.720 --> 32:36.240
So the starting point of the Greek crisis was rather bad luck combined with rather lax

32:36.480 --> 32:46.960
economic policies. No country should expect that they can overspend what they have

32:47.600 --> 32:54.160
and get away with it for a long term. If you look at Venezuela, it's not different from that,

32:54.160 --> 33:01.280
actually. In the case of Hugo Chavez and then his successor,

33:01.520 --> 33:11.040
they followed a rather classic left populist strategy of Latin America, which is that

33:11.040 --> 33:22.640
Venezuela is an oil country. When oil prices were high, Chavez spent very, very amply and

33:22.960 --> 33:32.480
and overspent, borrowed against future oil earnings. Then oil prices collapsed in the

33:32.480 --> 33:42.000
world markets in 2014. Chavez died of cancer. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, is not so clever

33:42.960 --> 33:52.080
and spent down the country's reserves. Basically, Venezuela went broke around 2017.

33:53.440 --> 34:03.600
Now, in both of those cases, one could say that the alternative project wasn't so accurate.

34:05.760 --> 34:17.200
I can tell you as a personal matter, I went to see Mr. Chavez in 2002 in Caracas. I know a thing

34:17.200 --> 34:25.200
or two about the Venezuelan economy because I worked on it. I studied it. I know a lot about

34:25.200 --> 34:35.200
oil rich economies from a lot of professional experience. I warned him, don't live only on oil.

34:36.160 --> 34:41.520
Don't keep your exchange rate overvalued. Don't borrow against your future income.

34:42.160 --> 34:48.800
I have to say either he heard the opposite of what I said each time because he didn't hear the

34:48.800 --> 34:56.400
don't and he thought I said do, or of course, more realistically, he had other things in mind

34:56.400 --> 35:02.880
and wasn't interested in listening to a university professor from Columbia University. But the fact

35:02.880 --> 35:10.880
of the matter is the economy was badly mismanaged. Now, having said that, there are two very important

35:10.880 --> 35:19.440
things to understand. One is that when countries get into economic crisis, really for whatever

35:19.440 --> 35:30.960
reason, out of their own mistakes or by international bad luck or by some pressure from abroad and often

35:30.960 --> 35:41.760
it's a mix of those, we should never tolerate mass suffering because for whatever reason a crisis

35:41.760 --> 35:50.720
comes, mass suffering is immoral in this world and very dangerous. It leads to terrible outcomes.

35:50.800 --> 36:00.080
People die, children die, there's mass hunger, there's destitution, there's disarray, and in

36:01.200 --> 36:08.960
Greece there was an extremely serious economic crisis. So I tried to help several Greek governments,

36:08.960 --> 36:18.400
in fact, when George Papandreou was prime minister and then when Mr. Tsipras was prime minister,

36:18.400 --> 36:23.920
so really across the political spectrum, I tried to help by saying to the Germans,

36:23.920 --> 36:30.480
look, you're the creditors, but you can't just squeeze this country so brutally because the

36:30.480 --> 36:38.720
pain that's involved is absolutely brutal. Well, they didn't listen and I think the outcomes

36:38.720 --> 36:45.680
were far more serious, negative and harmful than they ever should have been. Maybe Greece is

36:45.680 --> 36:50.480
starting to come out of that right now, but there still is a massive overhang of debt

36:50.480 --> 36:57.280
that should have been lifted from the books years ago. In the case of Venezuela, it is worse than

36:57.280 --> 37:05.040
that because it's not just that the world didn't come to the aid of Venezuela. When Donald Trump

37:05.040 --> 37:14.560
came to power, because Trump is a thug, he decided that he would try to overthrow Maduro. Now, this is

37:15.040 --> 37:22.560
absolutely against international law. It's against common sense. It's against basic decency

37:22.560 --> 37:30.960
and it is a very bad habit of the United States because the US is a kind of neo-colonial power.

37:30.960 --> 37:37.040
It is the world's most powerful country and it has a very bad track record of overthrowing

37:37.680 --> 37:45.760
governments of other countries. I was quite aghast at this. Donald Trump even told

37:45.760 --> 37:52.560
Latin American leaders, maybe we'll just invade directly. He said that in September 2017 at a

37:52.560 --> 37:58.000
private dinner of a number of Latin American presidents who subsequently told me about the

37:58.000 --> 38:06.240
dinner conversation. That's not just not helping. That is being a thuggish. That is being absolutely

38:06.240 --> 38:12.960
reckless. Well, it got worse than that because Trump, rather than invading, decided to squeeze

38:14.160 --> 38:21.200
the life out of the Venezuelan economy. They were bankrupt already but then

38:22.480 --> 38:31.920
Donald Trump essentially said, we will block Venezuela's access to the financial markets,

38:31.920 --> 38:40.080
starting with the oil companies, the main oil company in the middle of 2017. Then in January

38:40.080 --> 38:49.280
2019, just this year, Trump issued an order which said, you can't do business anymore and we're

38:49.280 --> 38:57.600
going to seize the assets of the Venezuelan government. The situation went from a self-inflicted

38:58.320 --> 39:05.600
wound, which Venezuela certainly had inflicted on itself, to what is a human catastrophe

39:06.320 --> 39:15.280
created by the United States. Hunger, a lack of access to medicines. It's an extraordinarily cruel

39:15.280 --> 39:25.040
policy. It is a war on the civilian population, not through a military attack but through a denial

39:25.040 --> 39:36.080
of food. Our international system is extremely weak at stopping that. Where is Europe to say to

39:36.080 --> 39:43.600
the United States, you can't do that? Well, Europe barely has a foreign policy. It needs one. It needs

39:43.600 --> 39:49.360
a backbone to say to the United States, you can't get away with such thuggery. In fact,

39:49.360 --> 39:55.120
Europe has said, well, Maduro is a dictator, so we don't really want to stop the US pressure and

39:55.120 --> 40:02.800
so on, but the means of pressure is absolutely immoral and illegal. To answer your question,

40:04.080 --> 40:10.320
it's a bit complicated. Countries get themselves into trouble, but then I have two rules. One,

40:10.960 --> 40:19.280
when a country and a population is in trouble, they need help, period. These are human beings

40:19.520 --> 40:28.400
and leaving countries to suffer is a gigantic mistake, but worse than that, if you add on to

40:28.400 --> 40:39.520
the pressure and the US has a bad habit of doing this, then it's worse than merely a lack of effort.

40:40.240 --> 40:49.360
It's actually, in my view, a crime against the domestic population. Now, I can tell you that

40:50.240 --> 41:00.720
in this story, we are at the 100th anniversary of the Versailles Treaty and everyone should

41:00.720 --> 41:08.320
note and remember the meaning of that. 100 years ago at the end of World War I,

41:09.600 --> 41:21.040
France and Britain put heavy reparations on Germany at the defeated country and the victors

41:21.040 --> 41:28.080
said that the defeated country would have to bear an intolerable burden. The great economist John

41:28.080 --> 41:34.480
Maynard Keynes wrote in 1919 in one of the most important books of the 20th century called The

41:34.480 --> 41:43.280
Economic Consequences of the Peace. It is a mistake to levy such a harsh peace on Germany because it

41:43.280 --> 41:49.920
will lead to a backlash. He said within a generation, if this is done, there will be a

41:49.920 --> 41:56.240
terrible price to pay. Of course, it was 14 years later that Hitler came to power,

41:56.880 --> 42:04.800
in part because of the devastating economic conditions of Germany. We should never push

42:04.800 --> 42:10.080
countries through economic policies to despair, whether it's at the end of a war,

42:10.720 --> 42:19.440
whether it's because of even the self-inflicted wound of overborrowing, which gets a country into

42:19.440 --> 42:28.800
a debt crisis, or because a president of the United States doesn't like the political party

42:28.800 --> 42:34.880
in power in another country. All of that is extraordinarily dangerous and we should have

42:34.880 --> 42:40.480
learned the lesson of the 20th century and we should not be driving countries to despair.

42:40.960 --> 42:49.600
And if you look at what we're doing today, it's not only Venezuela, it's not only the harshness

42:49.600 --> 42:57.920
with which Greece was treated. Iran, because of the US again, is being squeezed to the point of

42:57.920 --> 43:04.960
hunger and despair through US sanctions and Europe opposes those sanctions but doesn't really fight

43:04.960 --> 43:11.600
them adequately. They just say, oh, we can't really do anything. The United States, you know,

43:11.600 --> 43:18.480
it's an important market and our businesses don't want to violate US sanctions. Well,

43:18.480 --> 43:24.320
Europe should have a backbone and should stand up and say the US sanctions are against international

43:24.320 --> 43:31.280
law, they're against common sense, they're against the Europe's security interests, they're against

43:31.280 --> 43:36.160
the world's security interests, and we absolutely reject them and will not honor them.

43:38.400 --> 43:44.320
I'm so terribly sorry that we have to stop this interview at this moment because I'm being signaled

43:44.320 --> 43:51.280
that it's time to move on. I would have had so many more questions, but unfortunately,

43:51.280 --> 43:55.760
it's no time. Well, I hope we can do it again sometime. Thanks a lot for taking the time,

43:55.760 --> 43:58.400
Mr. Sachs. Great to speak with you. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
