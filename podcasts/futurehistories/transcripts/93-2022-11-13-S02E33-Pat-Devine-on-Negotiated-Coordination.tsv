0	8000	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross, and it is my great pleasure to welcome Pat Devine in today's episode.
8000	16000	With his 1988 book Democracy and Economic Planning, The Political Economy of a Self-Governing Society,
16000	23000	Pat Devine put forward a concrete formal model of how democratic economic planning could actually work,
23000	29000	and it is one of the essential reads for people interested in the debate, I would say.
29000	41000	Since then, he has contributed to the topic in multiple publications, amongst others he was the guest editor of the 2002 special issue of Science and Society,
41000	48000	and as regular listeners will know, these special issues are part of the Envisioning Socialism project,
48000	54000	which is concerned with pushing forward the debate around democratic economic planning,
54000	65000	and these special issues, they are released every 10 years, and I already mentioned he was guest editor in 2002, and we now have 2022,
65000	71000	so this year has been one of those years where a new special issue came out,
71000	83000	and I used this as an opportunity to record a small mini-series of interviews with central authors involved in this science and society project called Envisioning Socialism.
83000	93000	The episodes with Robin Hannell on Paracon and with David Leibman on Multilevel Democratic Iterative Coordination have been released already,
93000	100000	and the release of today's episode with Pat Devine concludes this mini-series within future histories,
100000	110000	even though, of course, the planning debate in a broader sense will stay with us, since this is one of the main strands of future histories, so to speak.
111000	120000	Before we start, I would like to thank Wilfried, Lucas, Karl, Fabian, Benedict and Marie for their kind donations,
120000	127000	and I want to point you all to the English episodes only RSS feed and home page,

157000	158000	Welcome, Pat.
158000	160000	Thank you very much.
160000	165000	Let's start with a definition. What is democratic planning?
165000	172000	Well, I came to the idea of democratic planning, we'll probably come partly to this later on as well,
172000	181000	through thinking about the fact that Soviet-style top-down planning proved not to work,
181000	192000	and the principal alternative that certainly people who continued to believe that some sort of socialist economy was necessary
192000	199000	turned out to be market socialism, and I wasn't happy with market socialism,
199000	207000	because it seemed to me that particularly from Marx's work, The Critique of the Goethe Programme,
207000	214000	there were sort of two fundamental features of a post-capitalist society.
215000	224000	One was the end of exploitation. Well, market socialist enterprises, you could argue, were able to deal with that.
224000	228000	But the other was the end of the anarchy of production.
228000	239000	And the anarchy of production, in effect, is the same thing as Adam Smith's invisible hand, or what today is called market forces.
240000	246000	And since market socialism, although it changed the character of the enterprise,
246000	255000	and therefore you could say abolished or potentially abolished exploitation, it didn't deal with the anarchy of production.
255000	267000	And so what happened was that autonomous enterprises, state-owned or worker cooperatives or whatever, competed against one another.
267000	269000	That's what market forces are about.
269000	280000	And that was intended to be a way of ensuring that there was incentive structures for enterprises
280000	286000	to make sure that they were producing efficiently and what consumers, users wanted.
286000	296000	But that seemed to me to violate the second essential feature of Marx's view of socialism.
296000	299000	And so I thought, well, what are the alternatives?
299000	314000	And the alternative seemed to be not to rely on competition as a mechanism, but rather to rely upon cooperation, discussion, negotiation.
314000	325000	And that's why I developed this idea of a layered structure of decision making and implementation
325000	336000	based on the principle of subsidiarity, which originally comes from, believe it or not, the Catholic Church, the concept of subsidiarity,
336000	351000	where decisions, at least in principle, are to be taken and implemented at the most local level that is consistent with all people affected by the decisions
351000	355000	being involved in making them and carrying them out.
355000	373000	So that essentially is what led me to look at the history of working class and popular involvement, struggles and demands to be involved in decision making,
373000	378000	not just political decision making, but also decision making with respect to the economy.
378000	382000	And there are historical examples of that.
382000	390000	But what really led me in this direction was the fact that in the 1970s, which you of course won't remember,
390000	406000	but the 1970s was, if you like, a crucial turning point for the capitalist world because it was the decade in which inflation got completely out of control.
406000	416000	So in the UK, in the middle of 1975, the rate of inflation had reached 50 percent per annum.
416000	420000	Now, that for a developed capitalist country is very high.
420000	425000	And it was clear that something had to be done about it.
425000	441000	And there were two approaches to it, one which the Polish economy, Michael Kulecki, had predicted in the 1940s during the Second World War,
441000	455000	which was, well, the idea that unemployment is a problem for capitalism, which is, of course, what socially involved people thought unemployment is a bad thing.
455000	464000	But Kulecki argued that the fact of the matter is the smooth functioning of capitalism depends on unemployment.
464000	467000	It's a structural feature of capitalism.
467000	473000	And therefore, if you were going to, as happened at the end of the Second World War,
473000	481000	if you were going to follow the work and the expectations that had been done during the war,
481000	492000	summed up for the UK in the report of beverage, full employment in a free society, where a free society was, of course, a free capitalist society,
493000	496000	then how would it work?
496000	508000	And the problem with full employment for capitalism, as Kulecki saw it, was that it meant that the working class was stronger
508000	516000	in full employment situation, both in terms of the negotiations to get a job.
516000	526000	But secondly, also, when you had a job and you were working in an enterprise and you wanted to have some play in how it was done, how it was being run.
526000	537000	So Kulecki predicted that if we had full employment, it would cause problems, as indeed it did in the 1970s,
537000	545000	when full employment resulted in this decade, really, of mounting inflation.
545000	550000	And there were basically two ways of dealing with that.
550000	555000	One was not that it was put this way, but in fact, it's what happened.
555000	565000	One was to recreate unemployment, which is what happened with the advent of neoliberalism, Thatcher, Reagan, and so on.
565000	579000	But the other was to do a deal with the unions and to say, look, if we get money wage increases at a higher rate than the increase in the rate of productivity,
579000	584000	then that's going to result in price increases.
584000	590000	Because if you've got an oligopolistic situation, as you had in all the developed capitalist countries,
590000	598000	an enterprise could increase prices without altering its competitive position with respect to other enterprises,
598000	606000	because the oligopolistic situation was one in which they had to take account of one another's actions.
606000	613000	And so if one enterprise increased prices, the others would do the same without altering their relative positions.
613000	623000	So the proposal that was put forward in the UK was to have a prices and incomes policy,
623000	641000	whereby the unions representing Labour, the capitalist organisations and the government would come together to agree on what age increases would be,
641000	647000	what price increases they would be, and that would solve the problem.
647000	655000	Now, at that time, I was on the Economic Advisory Committee of the Communist Party in the UK,
655000	662000	and we were in a minority there saying, look, this is a crisis, something's got to be done about it.
662000	673000	What should happen, we think, is that the unions and the Labour Party and the Communist Party should support the prices and incomes policy,
673000	684000	but on condition. And the conditions were, well, since real income increases would depend on the increase in productivity on the one hand
684000	695000	and the distribution of output between profits and wages on the other hand, prices and incomes policies have to be policies in which it's agreed
695000	703000	that trade unions can be involved in the decisions that affect the rate of productivity increase.
703000	712000	And that meant basically impinging on managerial prerogatives, the prerogatives of capital.
712000	717000	They're the ones who decide on investment, on new technology and so on.
717000	722000	Unions had to be involved in taking those decisions as one of the conditions.
722000	729000	The other was there had to be an agreement on the share between wages and profits.
729000	737000	And that meant that unions, when I say unions, I'm talking of the representatives of the workers, obviously,
737000	745000	would have to agree on whether the distribution between wages and profits was what they were prepared to accept.
745000	756000	Now, that actually would have involved a move towards increasing social control over the decisions to do with economic matters
756000	761000	and increasing the input of workers in those decisions.
761000	775000	And we saw that as a step towards eventually getting rid of the capitalist element by moving towards taking over ownership, social ownership of the enterprises.
775000	780000	So that you can see is the beginnings of negotiation and agreement and coordination.
780000	787000	And that, in a sense, was the beginnings of my thoughts on how one would move to what we didn't want.
787000	791000	We didn't want a top down plan system.
791000	798000	We had that to some extent in the nationalised industries, but they were rather paternalistic.
798000	806000	And they didn't involve workers or, for that matter, consumers and users in the decisions with respect to the industry.
806000	816000	What happened was that they were made by people who thought they were doing the right thing for people rather than people doing things for themselves.
816000	818000	So that's the origin of it.
818000	829000	And that's why it had to be a structured layer combining, if you like, centralised decisions where the issues at stake affected everybody.
830000	840000	And then more localised decisions where the decisions involved only affected, well, in the case of, say, the running of an enterprise, the workers in that enterprise.
840000	848000	So they would operate with an enterprise in which the overall criteria were set more generally.
848000	856000	But how to operate and implement within the enterprise those criteria was up to the people working in the enterprise and doing it.
856000	861000	So that's why it needed to be a structured layer of decision making.
861000	876000	And it meant that workers, instead of being passive recipients of decisions that other people had made, were in fact themselves involved as agents in making the decisions.
876000	895000	So it was also, we thought anyway, a way in which you could move towards within still a capitalist system towards overcoming the various forms of alienation that are created by the operation of capitalism.
895000	900000	So that is basically what the model is about.
900000	915000	It's about enabling people at different levels in relation to different decisions and in different ways to be involved in those decisions so that they feel some sort of responsibility for them.
915000	933000	At the same time as making sure that they are decisions that they feel are in their interests, but not only in their interests, but in the interests of other people who will also be affected by the decision, which is why they too have to be involved in the process of making decisions.
933000	943000	So that's a long winded way of saying, well, I see the underlying sort of focus of democratic planning is based upon participation.
943000	950000	That's very nice to see that this is actually coming from a very practical involvement that you had with actual politics.
950000	951000	Yes, absolutely.
951000	957000	And then you tried to form a model around these experiences, actually.
957000	959000	That's very interesting.
959000	972000	I could just add that during that period of the prices and incomes policy, there was also drawn up initially, funnily enough, by a conservative government.
972000	975000	But then they lost power or lost the election.
975000	984000	And so there was then a Labour government and they formed there was a national plan was drawn up in the UK.
984000	1001000	This national plan was a response to the fact that with the end of colonialism, with the end of imperialism, well, maybe not the end, but the weakening of it, that privileged position that it gave the UK economy was undermined.
1001000	1011000	And so the UK economy is losing way to other economies with all capitalist economies, but it was becoming relatively weaker.
1011000	1015000	And that process, of course, has gone on and on and on ever since.
1015000	1025000	But so that meant that something had to be done, as it were, productivity increases were small, et cetera, et cetera.
1025000	1041000	And so a national plan was drawn up and the national plan again was drawn up by discussion between the government, the unions and the employers representatives.
1041000	1047000	And they agreed on plans to improve the performance of the economy.
1047000	1059000	And then underneath that, that was called the National Economic Development Council, National Economic Development Council, which came to be known as a NEDE for some reason or other.
1059000	1065000	And underneath that, there were little NEDEs, which were comparable bodies for each industry.
1065000	1080000	So each industry would have a little NEDE where the trade unions representing workers in that industry, the government or the local government and the employers organizations at that level would again come together
1080000	1088000	and see how they would best implement the provisions of the overall plan within their particular industry.
1088000	1094000	So that was another, if you like, example of a layered process of decision making.
1094000	1097000	The national plan failed, but that's another matter.
1097000	1102000	So we are already very deep in the subject matter.
1102000	1113000	I think maybe to kind of also introduce the audience to the topic, let's approach the thing on a more abstract level.
1113000	1126000	I mean, you very nicely elaborated how you came to your specific model of negotiated coordination, but maybe just as a very short description, an abstract description,
1126000	1137000	what are the main characteristics of a democratic planned economy in general compared to other types of political economy?
1137000	1152000	Well, I suppose at the most general level, it means that the society, whether it's a local society or a regional society or a national society
1152000	1167000	or a international society or a global society, all these different levels, they all get together to decide at the appropriate level
1167000	1180000	what the policies that would contribute to human well-being, the best policies to contribute to human well-being would be as they currently saw things.
1180000	1187000	And then they would discuss again at the different levels how to implement that.
1187000	1196000	So, for example, take the issue of climate change at the moment, which is obviously a very hot issue, probably the most important issue.
1196000	1206000	So it's quite clear what needs to be done at a global level, but it's not at all clear that it's going to be done.
1206000	1216000	And that is because of the conflicting interests of the different countries and within the different countries, the different sectors of public opinion,
1216000	1219000	the different sectors of the economy and so on.
1219000	1232000	So what this would do would be to say, OK, at that level, global level, there would be agreement reached upon what needed to be done
1232000	1241000	in order to deal with the climate change, the loss of biodiversity, global warming and all the rest of it.
1241000	1250000	And then there would have to be agreement on how what needed to be done would be distributed between the different countries.
1250000	1255000	And that would obviously have to depend upon the historical record.
1255000	1267000	That is to say, the developed capitalist countries are the ones most responsible for the climate crisis and the loss of biodiversity, not the only ones, but the main ones.
1267000	1276000	And that would obviously have to be reflected in the decisions about how much of what needed to be done had to be done by the different countries.
1276000	1287000	And a similar process would apply within each country and then within each country, within each region and then within each region, locality.
1287000	1300000	So it would give people directly and indirectly control over what needed to be done in order to contribute best to human flourishing,
1300000	1310000	taking into account the different positions that different parts of the globe, different sections of the community are in,
1310000	1319000	different responsibilities, how you were going to agree on what would be a reasonably fair way of dealing with this.
1319000	1331000	And the point that one has to realize is that this is not sounds implausible in our existing society because that's not how capitalism works.
1331000	1343000	But if you're in a socialist society, some people thought of a socialist society as a society in which there would be no difference of views.
1343000	1352000	That's why the government or even the party or even the political committee could take decisions which would affect everybody.
1352000	1355000	But that's not how life is and it can never be.
1355000	1374000	And so it's a way of enabling people at different levels to feel that they or their people like them or groups that represent them are involved in a real way in making the decisions
1374000	1390000	and carrying them out to their and everybody else's in that particular group of people to their benefit, taking account of the fact that if what they do affects other people in a significant way,
1390000	1402000	then they too have to be involved in taking the decision. So it's if you like participation, it's not sort of passive democracy, it's active participatory democracy.
1402000	1413000	Now, there is a problem. We've come across this because a close colleague of mine, an ex PhD student of mine, Fitred Adaman from Turkey, of whom I've written a lot.
1413000	1422000	We've written a lot together, but he has been quite influential within Turkey in promoting this idea of participation.
1422000	1434000	And there have been various studies carried out trying to bring together parties in particular areas, different interests to see if they can arrive at some sort of agreement.
1434000	1446000	And very often they do arrive at an agreement, but then nothing happens because they don't have the power to ensure that what's agreed is then actually carried out.
1446000	1458000	And so we've decided that there's a danger in certain circumstances, just like there's a danger of greenwash where, you know, oil companies say they're doing something.
1458000	1471000	But there's also a danger we've decided of participation wash. People feel that they're actually participating, but they're not really participating in a way that makes a real difference to what happens.
1471000	1482000	And that's, if you like, why you can't talk about all the things, the ideas that we've been working on as relevant within a capitalist society.
1482000	1495000	You have to think of ways in which those ideas can be used to promote prefigurative actions of one sort or another that would lead further in the direction.
1495000	1502000	And, you know, there are plenty of examples around of people who've thought similarly.
1502000	1509000	I mean, the other another person I've spent quite a lot of time studying and working on is Karl Polanyi.
1509000	1514000	And he has this idea of the double movement.
1514000	1522000	Capitalism causes problems. Society strikes back and regulates that causes capitalism to seize up.
1522000	1528000	So you get, if you like, the opposite movement to reestablish the market.
1528000	1541000	And it goes on and on like that until society in the end takes full control over its economic aspects, which means you have to, in his terminology,
1541000	1548000	get rid of the fictitious commodities market for capital, labor and money.
1548000	1558000	So you can move in those directions within capitalism in a prefigurative way or in ways that then lead to the next stage of demands.
1558000	1569000	But you can't really expect to be able to implement things in the way that the model envisages unless you get rid of capitalism.
1569000	1584000	And one of the ways in which you can help to do that is by this idea of moving in that direction through various forms of prefiguration and theoretical and ideological work and so on.
1584000	1598000	Brilliant. I absolutely share this analysis 100%, specifically the idea that we need prefigurative politics and actions in the here and now.
1598000	1607000	But we do also need formal models of how a democratic participatory plant economy could actually look like.
1607000	1613000	So let's dive a little deeper into how your model is set up.
1613000	1620000	Could you describe the core elements of your model, which you call negotiated coordination?
1620000	1635000	Well, OK, so the first building block is the concept of what I call social ownership, not private ownership, not state ownership, but social ownership.
1635000	1648000	And social ownership, I think of as ownership of all the groups that are going to be affected by the use of the assets involved.
1648000	1660000	So if you've got an activity which only affects a small local area, then it could be run by an individual or a small co-op or whatever.
1660000	1675000	If you've got an enterprise which covers a wider area, then it would need to be owned by the interests within that wider area who are affected.
1675000	1684000	And so it comes back to what I was saying about the climate change, the environmental ecological crisis we're facing.
1684000	1693000	There'll be different levels at which decisions have to be taken because different people are affected at different levels.
1693000	1701000	At each of those levels, the people who are the groups that are affected need to be the social owners.
1701000	1711000	So that's the concept of social ownership, ownership by the groups of people who are affected by the decisions, by the use of the assets involved.
1711000	1719000	And so that then leads me because I'm now thinking more in terms of economic activity.
1719000	1724000	I mean, you can apply the same principles more generally to political and social activity,
1724000	1732000	but I'm thinking more generally because after all, I've come at it from the standpoint of an economist or a political economist, I like to think.
1732000	1743000	So then you say to yourself, OK, if you take an industry at the level of the enterprises that constitute that industry or sector of the economy,
1743000	1756000	whatever you want to call it, the people who are going to be affected by the activities of that enterprise are the people who work in it.
1756000	1767000	People who use what it produces, either consumers or other enterprises, if they're intermediate goods that the enterprise produces,
1767000	1772000	the locality in which the enterprise is based and the people who live there.
1772000	1786000	So just let's take those three, those three groups, workers in the enterprise, users of what the enterprise produces and the locality where the enterprise is based.
1786000	1792000	They would be the social owners in a simplified way of the enterprise.
1792000	1799000	You might also want to say, well, we might want still to have people who are greens,
1799000	1807000	who are concerned about the way the enterprise will affect the environment and the ecology, and that's the focus of their interest.
1807000	1816000	Similarly, you might want to have groups or associations of people who are concerned with equal opportunities,
1816000	1828000	who would also if you decided that enterprise was such that it needed those things or more, they would be part of the group of social owners as well.
1828000	1837000	And they would be responsible for the activities of the enterprise using its existing productive capacity.
1837000	1844000	And they would then produce with that productive capacity what they thought was needed.
1844000	1856000	And that would be a way of generating information because if consumers or other enterprises didn't want to make use of what they were producing,
1856000	1867000	that would be evident in the fact that they would produce more than they could sell or they would have to lower their prices and then they wouldn't be able to produce as much and so on.
1868000	1871000	So that would be at the level of the enterprise.
1871000	1886000	But then if the size of the industry needed to increase or to shrink, either because increase because demand for it, what it produced was increasing and so on,
1886000	1897000	it would have to either invest or disinvest, and that would affect all the people who were the social owners of the enterprise.
1897000	1907000	But since there'd be more than typically more than one enterprise in an industry or a sector, other enterprises would be faced with the same problems.
1907000	1910000	Were they going to expand or shrink?
1910000	1921000	And therefore, when it comes to a process of how do you decide on the pattern of investment across all the enterprises in the industry or sector,
1921000	1926000	that doesn't only affect one enterprise, it affects all of them.
1926000	1935000	And therefore, they all have to be involved as the social owners of the decisions about investment, major investment in the industry.
1935000	1941000	And therefore, what would happen is that you would have a negotiated coordinating body.
1941000	1954000	So they would get together and they would have the information about the performance of individual enterprises, how that what they were producing was being received by the users.
1954000	1964000	But they would also have information about the work situation in the area where the enterprises were based.
1964000	1974000	There might be some areas which were suitable only for this type of enterprise and other areas which were suitable for all sorts of different enterprises,
1974000	1988000	in which case you'd think, well, the area that was only suitable or the activity that was only suitable for this area is probably the one where activity should expand,
1988000	1993000	investment should be so that there's work for people in that area to do.
1993000	1998000	Areas where you can easily move from one type of production activity to another,
1999000	2006000	maybe don't need the same amount of activity from this industry, they can have activity from others.
2006000	2009000	So you'd have to take that into account as well.
2009000	2025000	And you'd arrive then at a decision about the allocation of investment or disinvestment if the industry was shrinking across the body of enterprises that constituted the industry.
2025000	2034000	And if the industry was expanding, you might even need to take account of other areas where the industry wasn't currently based.
2034000	2039000	But maybe there was a shortage of work there or activity there.
2039000	2042000	And this particular activity was suitable there.
2042000	2052000	So you would be able to establish new enterprises in such areas rather than expand existing enterprises.
2052000	2071000	So where you've got interdependent decisions that would affect people in this wider group of areas or this wider group of enterprises that would have to be taken by negotiation between all the affected groups.
2071000	2074000	So that would be the second sort of strand of it.
2075000	2089000	And that, I noticed in one of your questions, that for me is the distinction between market exchange, which is what the individual enterprise engages in.
2089000	2101000	And in capitalism, how the interdependent activities of the different enterprises are coordinated is through the operation of market forces.
2101000	2108000	Profitable enterprises expand, unprofitable enterprises contract or disappear.
2108000	2115000	But that happens in ways that nobody really has any control over.
2115000	2122000	It just happens because if you're making a profit, you can expand and if you're not, you can't and you have to contract.
2122000	2128000	So market forces produce outcomes that no one willed.
2128000	2129000	Nobody planned them.
2129000	2132000	They just happen as a result of the operation of market forces.
2132000	2139000	Negotiated coordination is an alternative to market forces as a way of coordinating activity.
2139000	2153000	It's also less wasteful because the problem, as, for example, the English economist Morris Dobb emphasized, is that where you've got interdependent decisions to be made,
2154000	2161000	which the outcome of one depends upon what other people are doing as well as what you do.
2161000	2176000	It's better if you can to coordinate those decisions in advance rather than let them be coordinated after the event by the operation of market forces.
2176000	2189000	Now, that also brings us to one of the other questions or points you've made in your list of questions, which would be helpful, which was the two different sorts of certainty.
2189000	2200000	So Morris Dobb emphasized that within a economy which is coordinated through the results of market forces operating,
2200000	2210000	one form of uncertainty is created by the fact that you don't know what other enterprises are going to be doing,
2210000	2216000	whereas what other enterprises are going to be doing will affect the outcome of what you're doing.
2216000	2230000	So that's one sort of uncertainty. That can be abolished by planning, ex ante planning, planning in advance rather than ex post coordination after the event.
2230000	2244000	Now, the second sort of uncertainty is uncertainty of the sort that Keynes was referred to when he was trying to draw a distinction between uncertainty and risk.
2244000	2256000	That if you know what the possible outcomes are and what the probability of those outcomes is going to be or is, then you can calculate the risk.
2256000	2266000	But what about things where there's an outcome that nobody knows? But it could happen. You don't even know what it is.
2267000	2277000	So this is what he was talking, of course, within a capitalist economy. So he said nobody knows what the price of copper is going to be in 20 years time.
2277000	2287000	So you can't really plan that. It's not quite true. You could plan it anyway. That's a different area we could go into.
2287000	2303000	So what we call ex ante coordination, coordination before the implementation of these decisions, even though the outcome of each decision depends also on what the other decisions are.
2304000	2318000	Coordination ex ante can get rid of the first sort of uncertainty, but not, of course, the second sort. And for that, then you need contingency planning and all the rest of it.
2318000	2339000	But so really, what this would enable would be society at different levels within that people who comprise the societies, having some sort of control over the direction of development of economic activity.
2339000	2350000	What sort of new investment would be needed? What sorts of new industries would be needed? Because you also have planning boards at different levels.
2350000	2365000	And it would also mean that people weren't subject to things beyond their control, like, you know, nowadays, a factory decides to be the owners of a factory decide to close it without any consultation of the workers.
2365000	2372000	Or maybe they have to negotiate with the workers to avoid a strike or whatever it is. And it may destroy the area.
2372000	2393000	I mean, when the coal mines shut in the UK, whole areas, whole towns and villages, which depended upon the coal mines for their lives, it's structured the whole sort of social, cultural, political activities of the life of the people who live there.
2394000	2411000	Suddenly all went. And of course, nothing was replaced, replacing it. The idea would be, you know, the Neo, the market forces idea is that, well, if this activity goes, it means that there'll be unemployment, wages will be down.
2411000	2420000	So new forms of capital will come in. And that it'll all work out in the long run. But it's all very well to talk about the long run. But what about the people who live there in the short run?
2420000	2440000	So there we are. I mean, that's, I suppose, basically what I would see the advantage of a participatory planning model based upon social ownership and negotiated coordination.
2441000	2455000	I think it would be great because you already started to sketch the institutional framework that you lay out within your book. And you started by describing social ownership, what you think this should be like.
2456000	2480000	You describe the production units, at least in a rough form, and then went on to describe that there will be negotiated coordination bodies, which will coordinate, for example, sectors, depending on the level, so to speak, that needs to be addressed in a given industry, depending on the reach of how many people in which areas are affected by it.
2480000	2491000	But maybe it would be good to try to complete the picture of the institutional setup, because you briefly touched upon the fact that there will be planning commissions.
2491000	2507000	But within your model, there is indeed a very kind of concrete idea of how this whole process would actually work out and which bodies, institutional bodies are involved in it.
2507000	2527000	And I think it would be great for the listeners to get an idea of the whole process of production units transferring economic information and meeting within negotiated coordination bodies, which will then transfer the accumulated information, so to speak, to a planning commission.
2527000	2531000	They will develop a plan and so on and so on.
2531000	2540000	I think it would be great to kind of sketch the rough picture of the whole process of functioning of the model, so to speak.
2540000	2551000	Yes, well, I suppose, I mean, the way I see it is that you've got this layered structure of decision making and implementation.
2551000	2570000	And each level of the structure operates within a framework that has been set by decisions of the higher levels of decision making bodies in the structure, the more general levels, put it that way.
2570000	2583000	So, for example, if we're talking about a socialist or communist society, we would be talking about a society in which there was no unearned income.
2583000	2593000	There would be income for people who couldn't contribute, couldn't work or who were ill or who were young or who were old, of course.
2593000	2610000	But people who are perfectly capable of working wouldn't obtain income by virtue of owning capital or land or whatever you might think about it.
2610000	2625000	So you'd have a set of values in which production for use rather than production for profit would be the value that people had internalized.
2625000	2634000	And you'd also have ideas of social human well-being, human flourishing and what was needed for that.
2634000	2638000	And so there would be certain basic needs that had to be met.
2638000	2644000	And there would be also, one would expect, plenty of time.
2644000	2649000	You could call it free time, if you like, or time where you weren't actually working.
2649000	2654000	But you might be doing other sorts of things that could count as work if you wanted to think about them like that way.
2654000	2660000	You know, time for recreation, for creativity, for artistic activities.
2660000	2670000	You'd also have a system in which the different sorts of work, particularly in this country at the moment, there's a big discussion going on about caring work.
2670000	2681000	And at the moment, people who do caring work, whether within the family or the household or whether through paid caring work,
2681000	2690000	it's usually seen as rather sort of low level work, certainly lowly paid compared to all sorts of other things.
2690000	2697000	So you'd have a different set of values. Such activities would be valued much more highly than they are in capitalist society.
2697000	2704000	Unless, of course, if you're a very rich capitalist society, you can employ servants and all the rest of it.
2705000	2711000	So I suppose at the most general level, you'd have political discussions.
2711000	2718000	That's why the subtitle of my book was called The Political Economy of a Self-Governing Society.
2718000	2728000	And this self-governing society is not a state that governs, hands things down, but is a self-governing society in a layered structure.
2728000	2738000	And so you'd have, for example, at the highest level, the most general level, you'd obviously have to have legislation to do with, say,
2738000	2747000	human rights, equal treatment, people not being able to be discriminated against and so on.
2747000	2755000	And that would create a framework within which at lower levels, you'd have to take account of that.
2755000	2765000	So you couldn't have a situation where, say, a local village or government council decided they didn't want any Roma or Gypsy people.
2765000	2773000	That would not be allowed as a result of the higher level framework that would be established at that level.
2773000	2784000	And so that's the sort of principle that would apply about the relationship between the different levels politically, but also economically in terms of economic activity.
2784000	2792000	And so you'd have a political structure, which again would be a layered structure.
2792000	2809000	There'd be an overall probably world, if not government, then at least a world set of institutions which would decide on, as we've already said, on policies to do with climate change, biodiversity and so on.
2809000	2823000	And then they could have regions like the EU, which unfortunately the UK has left, but it could have stayed in and tried to change the things about it that it didn't like in discussion with other people.
2823000	2831000	People who voted to leave are now discovering that what they expected would be great and turned out to be a problem.
2832000	2839000	We don't need to go there. So I think you'd have a layered political structure.
2839000	2860000	You'd have a layered economic structure which would include what you could call planning boards to do with a local area, a city, a region, a country, a set of regions like the EU or the world.
2860000	2886000	I mean, at the moment, for example, it does seem ridiculous that we have most of the goods that used to be produced in the developed capitalist countries before deindustrialization are now produced in China or similar less developed countries
2886000	2896000	and then shipped all the way back, as it were. The technology often comes from the West, but the goods are produced and then shipped for the West to use.
2896000	2906000	So when it comes to CO2 emissions, you can't only take account of these CO2 emissions in producing what you produce in your own country.
2906000	2914000	You have to take account of the CO2 emissions that are produced by other countries on your behalf that are then exported to you.
2914000	2922000	So I would expect that, of course, people concerned would have to decide at the time when we got there.
2922000	2945000	But I would expect there'd be a move to much more, if you like, local, localized production, which would be then spread more fairly across the world and within a country, across the country, taking account of geographical, climatic, et cetera, conditions.
2945000	2952000	And I would expect, therefore, there to be much less, if you like, transportation across the world.
2952000	2957000	But who knows? I mean, that might be wrong, but that's what I would expect.
2957000	2977000	But that wouldn't be decided, obviously, by me. That would be decided by the people in a participatory democratic fashion, layered fashion, deciding at the different levels what was best for the people who lived there, for them, and so on.
2977000	2999000	So you could argue that the level of the negotiated coordination body, there would not only be, it would not only consist of the enterprises in the industry or sector, the places, the regions where those enterprises were based, other regions that perhaps
2999000	3008000	were under provided for in terms of economic activity and the planning board that would put that input into it.
3008000	3024000	So you'd have a structure, in a way, not too different from what was planned, say, in the national plan in this country, except it was a national plan that existed on paper only.
3024000	3031000	It didn't exist in reality. If you like, at best, within the terminology, you could call it indicative planning.
3031000	3045000	But indicative planning, which has been tried in various capitalist countries, never works, because for it to work, all the people who've got to follow the indications in the different parts of the economy don't necessarily all do it.
3045000	3059000	So it begins to, that's why the national plan fell apart, because it envisaged that there would be a certain balance between imports and exports, and there wasn't.
3059000	3069000	And so it ran into a balance of payments crisis, which had effects on the value of the currency. And so the whole thing collapsed.
3069000	3076000	So you've got to have a system in which decisions are made by the people who are going to be affected by them.
3076000	3083000	And therefore, there's more chance of them actually being implemented because they've agreed on them.
3083000	3093000	So it's not a society that I envisage or an economic activity structure that I envisage, which is all predetermined.
3093000	3100000	It's activities decentralized, but within a centralized framework, if you like.
3100000	3114000	So just to sum up, social ownership, negotiated coordinated bodies, planning boards, all operating in an interdependent way with the planning boards,
3114000	3130000	if you like, representing the political side of things, the government or the authority structure at each level of the layered structure of decision making and implementation.
3130000	3136000	I think that's probably the best I can do in terms of the institutional framework.
3136000	3151000	I think we need to try to sketch maybe an example of how this would work out in concrete terms, because I mean, we now have this institutional framework.
3151000	3160000	We have the production units, we have the negotiated coordination bodies, we have the planning commissions all on different levels.
3160000	3171000	But how would the concrete planning and organization of economic production work out in concrete terms?
3171000	3185000	There would be this flow of information, as we already touched upon from production units, and then this negotiation process at the level of the negotiation coordination bodies.
3185000	3195000	And they would then transfer this, like then produce collectively produced information to the planning commission.
3195000	3203000	But for example, at this point, maybe could you sketch an image of what this information would entail?
3203000	3211000	Like what would be the level of precision in terms of information that would be transferred to the planning commission?
3211000	3216000	And then so what are the information of inputs that lead into the planning commission?
3216000	3220000	What are the processes within the planning commissions?
3220000	3224000	You have to say in plural, because they are on many different levels.
3224000	3232000	What are the processes within these planning commissions with which they try to develop a sensible plan?
3232000	3242000	And what are the parameters along which this process tries to figure out what is seen as sensible and what is not?
3242000	3250000	Because there are different elements to this, there are political elements to this, there are elements of like mere efficiency, so to speak.
3250000	3267000	And so I would be interested in how this would go along in order to, at the end, produce a plan that is both sensible in terms of not wasting resources unnecessarily,
3267000	3283000	and also able to lead to a consensus about the implementation of this given plan, because these are both like difficult goals to achieve, actually, I would say.
3283000	3298000	Well, I suppose the first thing I'd say in response to that is that you talked about information flowing up through the different levels to inform what happens at each level.
3298000	3303000	And that is undoubtedly one of the central processes that I would envisage.
3303000	3313000	But equally, what you did mention, which I think is as important, is that there would also be information flowing down,
3313000	3326000	so that the decisions that the enterprise makes are partly dependent on the framework set by the decisions made by the negotiated coordination bodies.
3326000	3334000	And their decisions are likewise partially shaped by the information coming down from the Planning Commission.
3334000	3343000	So there's, if you like, an interactive flow of information between the different levels, which is, one would hope,
3343000	3357000	what would enable the different levels of decision making, the different bodies, to make the most effective use of the available, the relevant information coming from lots of different sources.
3357000	3372000	So I've already said that one source of information would be the performance of the enterprise, each enterprise, in terms of what it's producing is received by its potential users.
3372000	3387000	So you could have a situation in which the enterprise is producing more than its users want to use, whether they're consumers or other enterprises using intermediate goods.
3387000	3399000	Equally, if that's the case, then what they do would be to either they'd have to build up stocks, inventories, the enterprises producing, they wouldn't be selling everything.
3399000	3412000	Or if they weren't producing enough, then they would have order books, which weren't being fulfilled as rapidly as they would like to fill them.
3412000	3423000	That would suggest that either the enterprise needs to expand or contract, depending upon whether it's producing too much or too little.
3423000	3450000	But then that's one source of information that would be relevant to the negotiated coordination body, which would be interested in, if you like, the extent to which the resources organized within the enterprise were being used in a way that contributed to what people wanted.
3450000	3462000	Then, of course, what people wanted, if we're talking about consumers, would be very different from what people want in a capitalist country where capitalism generates discontent.
3462000	3473000	It's not just that you want more, but you always want different things because, you know, everything's rapidly made obsolete fashion changes, but the rest of it.
3473000	3477000	So sort of turbo consumerism wouldn't exist.
3477000	3484000	And what would you be interested in would be what contributes to human flourishing, human needs.
3484000	3498000	And therefore, when you were considering how to say the level of the negotiated coordinating body, when you're considering what to do about the pattern of investment for the industry or sector that you're trying to work out,
3498000	3505000	you'd have to take account on the one hand of how the individual enterprises were doing.
3505000	3522000	On the other hand, you'd have to take account of what the situation within the localities in which enterprises were based, what the situation there was, was there the shortage of work, was there too much work, et cetera, et cetera.
3522000	3538000	You'd also have to take account of information that the negotiating board coordination body got from the planning board, which was to say, well, at the political level, it's been decided that we need to prioritize.
3538000	3546000	This form of development, we need to prioritize, for example, a shorter working week.
3546000	3551000	So you'd have to take account of that in terms of how you were going to operate.
3551000	3562000	Then in terms of what we've already talked about, climate change would affect the nature of the technology that you might have to move to or to install.
3562000	3584000	So I don't know that one can do more, at least I can do more than just say, well, there'd be a lot of different sources of information coming from a lot of different groups who are likely to be differently affected by the decisions taken.
3584000	3605000	And this information, because the groups themselves are participating in the discussions, is information which the groups themselves would be able to contribute to the discussion based upon their own experience, their own situation, which nobody else knows quite in the same way that they do.
3605000	3615000	In other words, if I wanted to use technical terms, it would be able to draw upon the social tacit knowledge of the group.
3615000	3622000	One of the things that the Austrians are always on about, or at least the modern Austrians, are tacit knowledge.
3622000	3632000	It used to be distributed knowledge, but since Oscar Langer's model solved that problem, they've now fallen back on tacit knowledge.
3632000	3643000	But when they think of tacit knowledge as individual knowledge, whereas, of course, you can have the tacit knowledge of a group learns how to work together and so on.
3643000	3650000	So the tacit knowledge of the different interests, groups representing the different interests, would be contributed.
3650000	3670000	And therefore, you'd have a situation in which there would be discussion about what to do, what decisions to make, based upon a consideration of all these different forms of knowledge that are relevant.
3670000	3690000	And it would take place in a group of people whose psychological predisposition, whose values were, well, look, we're obviously concerned about how this is going to affect us, but we also are concerned about how it's going to affect other people.
3690000	3706000	And therefore, we've got to come to an agreement about what the best outcome, not for everybody individually, but for the social owners as a whole would be.
3706000	3715000	So it's an extension of John Donne's, no man is an island, no group is an individual group, and all it cares about is itself.
3715000	3721000	It's part of a collectivity, and it's concerned with the well-being of the collectivity.
3721000	3727000	And the collectivity includes people who are going to be differently affected by the decision.
3727000	3740000	Some decisions will affect everybody adversely, but there's unlikely to be a decision that will affect everybody beneficially without if they didn't have to take account of other people.
3740000	3745000	So there'd have to be a process of discussion, negotiation.
3745000	3762000	And, you know, in a way, again, from my own experience, I've had a very sort of minor, very minor indeed example of this in the university, which has a limited budget.
3762000	3766000	Most universities don't have a large enough budget, but leave that aside.
3766000	3771000	So you've got the different departments, the different faculties.
3771000	3774000	They all want more resources.
3774000	3778000	And they have a resource committee.
3778000	3792000	And they have representatives from the different departments and faculties on this committee, and they argue and negotiate about how cuts or increases should be distributed.
3792000	3795000	But in the end, they reach an agreement.
3795000	3801000	Not everybody's happy with the agreement because they'd like more, but they'll live with it.
3801000	3805000	And, of course, you could say, well, supposedly somebody says we won't live with it.
3805000	3815000	Well, that's not how that's not the ethos of the sorts of discussion, sorts of negotiation that we're envisaging.
3815000	3821000	If we're talking about a socialist or communist society, we're talking about a society.
3821000	3832000	In which people's well-being depends as much on other people's well-being being catered for as on their own well-being catered for.
3832000	3834000	Solidarity, if you like.
3834000	3836000	So obviously, you're right.
3836000	3845000	They have to be, you know, it might be democratic decision voting in a negotiated coordination body.
3845000	3846000	There might be different ways.
3846000	3854000	There might be sort of weighted votes for the different groups if it was decided that some groups were more effective than others.
3854000	3861000	It might be with reserved levels of decisions, percentages of voting, depending upon.
3861000	3864000	So a variety of different ways would be evolved.
3864000	3874000	And I don't think in advance one can do more than sketch out these, at least I can do more than sketch out these general principles.
3874000	3882000	And it would be a learning process through which people would learn about the interests of other people.
3882000	3894000	It wouldn't be a process of preference aggregation because in the course of the discussions, the negotiations, people's preferences would change.
3894000	3901000	So by participating in this process, you change yourself, not just other people.
3902000	3907000	I think there are some elephants in the room that need to be addressed.
3907000	3912000	And I guess one of them would be the question of complexity.
3912000	3914000	Complexity.
3914000	3915000	Complexity, yes.
3915000	3926000	I mean, in a very abstract and general sense, I absolutely understand where you're coming from and the idea of what you said in your last sentence,
3926000	3937000	that it is not only about a collection of existing preferences, but about a collective production of a shared interest, so to speak.
3937000	3943000	And then the will and the ability to act upon it, maybe to add.
3943000	3945000	I absolutely share this.
3945000	3953000	But still, I mean, if we live in societies that have a degree of complexity that we do have right now,
3953000	3963000	and I think there are absolutely great benefits to this kind of complexity as well as dangers, of course, but still.
3963000	3970000	So it's not about getting back to a situation where everything is only produced on a local level,
3970000	3979000	where people kind of argue face to face how, what, and when things are being done.
3979000	3990000	But we have a degree of complexity and that definitely needs different kinds of processes in order to bring about, for example,
3990000	4001000	also complex products. If you take a computer and then some production unit would have to address all of the different layers,
4001000	4008000	all of the different people, all of the different areas that are in one way or another affected by producing a computer,
4008000	4024000	then this explodes the amount of people that would have to be involved in the decisions leading up to the final computer that we can use and work on.
4024000	4032000	Because, I mean, we have rare minerals, we have all sorts of materials that are produced in different areas of the world, et cetera, et cetera.
4032000	4040000	And about many of the ways in which these things could be produced, there will be conflict,
4040000	4045000	there will be different ideas of how things are being done, and so on and so on.
4045000	4053000	So I guess the elephant in the room would then be if we have this principle of social ownership,
4053000	4059000	if we have this principle of everybody who is in one way or another being affected,
4059000	4075000	then you would immediately run into very concrete problems in terms of how to actually produce, for example, a complex product such as a computer.
4075000	4085000	So maybe you could run us through the idea of how these questions could be addressed within your framework.
4085000	4095000	Well, I think this is, if you like, a variation on Oscar Wilde's objection,
4095000	4102000	not objection, but witty comment on whether socialism would work, too many meetings.
4102000	4105000	So I think it's a variation of that.
4105000	4109000	But the point is that, well, I'd make two points here.
4109000	4116000	Well, three, actually, the idea that everybody would have to be involved in every decision,
4116000	4126000	because everybody in some sense, however remotely is affected by every decision, is not anything like what I envisage.
4126000	4137000	I envisage, and I think the model envisages, that people are involved either directly or indirectly,
4137000	4148000	either face to face, as you put it, or via representatives in major decisions that affect them.
4148000	4155000	So, for example, it could argue that within an enterprise,
4155000	4162000	if the workforce comes across a better way of doing things than had previously been the case,
4162000	4168000	and that required a bit of new equipment or something, which you could call investment.
4168000	4177000	Minor investment like that would be within scope of the enterprise to do.
4177000	4187000	If it came to major investment, like a whole new factory or workshop,
4187000	4196000	then that would have to be considered in terms of, well, does this count as something which would affect other people to some extent,
4196000	4200000	to such an extent that they need to be involved in the decision or not?
4200000	4206000	And you could only work that out, I think, really, as things evolve.
4206000	4218000	I mean, I could fall back upon the generally accepted view that Marx and Engels didn't say much about how a future socialist society would work,
4218000	4225000	because that would have to be worked out by the people who were doing it, who were there, who were implementing it.
4225000	4228000	But in general, you can have the principles.
4228000	4239000	And so I think my first sort of comment on that would be that it wouldn't be a situation where everybody had to be involved in everything,
4239000	4251000	even if everybody is thought of as everybody who might have at some level some small input into the decision at some time or other.
4251000	4255000	So, I mean, at the moment, you talk about a computer.
4255000	4267000	Well, now, the complexity of everything that goes into that, obviously true scientific endeavor, a lot of international cooperation,
4267000	4274000	maybe not as much as they should be, but because of private property rights and all the rest of it.
4274000	4282000	Still, a lot of one of the problems that we're experiencing in the UK now, having left the EU,
4282000	4290000	is the extent to which we're still going to be involved in EU activities, scientific activities.
4290000	4298000	And surprise, surprise, they discover, well, if you're not in the EU, you don't actually have the same right to be involved as if you were in the EU.
4298000	4301000	What a surprise. Anyway, that's something else.
4301000	4309000	So that's the first thing I'd say that these things happen at the moment without everybody feeling they have to be involved in everything.
4309000	4319000	So that's the first thing. Second thing is at the moment in capitalist societies, you get a variety of institutional forms.
4319000	4329000	So, for example, you get the multinational firm, which is has a headquarters somewhere that has branches.
4329000	4343000	And there are different models. One model is not that similar to the distinction between market exchange and negotiated coordination over investment,
4343000	4352000	where the different branches of an enterprise submit their profits to a center and the center decides what to do with them,
4352000	4358000	how to allocate them to this branch or to close that branch or open another branch.
4358000	4363000	So these sorts of things already happen to a significant extent.
4363000	4378000	And of course, if you've got a conflictual relationship like you do under capitalism, workers, even managers in one branch is being closed, might not be happy.
4378000	4387000	But nevertheless, if they're not involved in the process of decision making, either directly or indirectly, what can they do?
4387000	4396000	There's not much they can do about it other than go on strike or work slow or and in the end that will probably cause the enterprise to shut.
4396000	4410000	The other thing to say, two other things to say, one is that actually, if you think about the way in which complex capitalist societies work,
4410000	4418000	they work almost exclusively based upon meetings.
4418000	4426000	There are meetings of boards of directors. There are meetings of technical teams.
4426000	4437000	There are meetings of human relations used to be called personnel. Now we're not personnel. We're not people anymore. We're just resources.
4437000	4449000	So one shouldn't underestimate the number of meetings that take place to run a complex capitalist society.
4449000	4477000	One shouldn't also underestimate the extent to which a lot of those meetings are to do with how to deal with getting round regulations, capitalist rivalry, protecting intellectual property, fighting legal battles, all of which you'd expect would more or less disappear in a socialist, so communist society.
4477000	4490000	So and then the third thing I'd like to say about that is that at the moment, we don't only have a functional division of labor, which you'll always need.
4490000	4502000	That is to say, you have electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, etc. You have electricians, you have plumbers.
4502000	4514000	So you have a functional division of labor. You also have accountants, managers, technicians.
4514000	4529000	You also have doctors, lawyers, architects. So you've got a functional division of labor, but you've also got a social division of labor.
4529000	4549000	That is to say, most people spend most of their time doing work of the same functional level, so skilled manual workers, professional workers, managers who run things, politicians.
4549000	4563000	Most people spend most of their time doing those sorts of works. It's a bit like, you know, in the university, you don't only have academics, but you also have people who clean the rooms and the corridors.
4563000	4572000	And most academics don't clean the rooms and the corridors. And most people who clean the offices and the floors aren't academics.
4572000	4596000	So there are these different social divisions, and it's been found, I think it would be fair to say, that people who are the same social level of division of labor, even though functionally they're doing different things, find it much easier to talk to one another than they do to talk to people who are in a different social level.
4596000	4624000	Now, if you, as I propose in my book, think of it that way, what I would envisage, what I argue for, is that we abolish the social division of labor, which is basically what Mark's talked about, the difference between intellectual and manual work generalized to the different social
4625000	4642000	division of labor. And we each, at various stages in our lives, or possibly at the same stage in our life, do different sorts of labor, which is currently now what is social division of labor divided.
4642000	4658000	So, for example, you get this process of, in military terms, you had national service, where all young people, usually young men, had to join the national service.
4658000	4675000	There has been proposals, what some people call shit work, that is to say, you know, emptying dust bins, or sweeping streets, or digging ditches, or whatever it is, it's something that actually, you could have a sort of social service.
4675000	4686000	And that could be done by, you know, young people, the necessary work that still remained after you went through as much mechanization and automation and so on as you can have.
4686000	4698000	And you could actually probably envisage, I mean, I did national service in the Royal Air Force in the UK, and although I wouldn't have had to spend my whole life doing it, it was quite an interesting experience.
4698000	4708000	And, you know, you learned something, it was boring, I wouldn't have wanted to spend most of my time doing it. But I was young, and you get through it.
4709000	4723000	And there's a certain camaraderie develops which you enjoy at that age and so on. But then, you know, I'm perfectly capable of cleaning my own office, but that's not how things are structured.
4723000	4740000	So if we all did our fair share, give or take a bit of the different social levels of activity, social division of labor, rather than functional division of labor, we'd have experience of all these different levels.
4740000	4759000	And it means, for example, that if we were involved, as for example, in the university, to some extent, where in the governing bodies of the university, people were mainly appointed, but there was a small proportion of elected members.
4759000	4782000	And if you were elected, and you got involved in the decisions involved in running a university, you learned what was involved, what mattered. And then when you stopped being elected, because we were usually elected by the, because we were the sort of representatives of the union, who would put themselves forward for election and usually got elected.
4782000	4800000	But you began to appreciate the problems that the management, if you like, was dealing with. And you didn't necessarily always agree with the decisions they made. But you could see that there were decisions that needed to be made, that weren't easy decisions.
4800000	4825000	And if you've had experience of that, it means that you approach it in a slightly different way. You're not always oppositional. And so no, we're not having that. You've got to think of something that what would you put forward as a way of dealing with the problem that would actually move things forward in the direction that you would like to see it go, rather than just no, no, no to everything.
4825000	4842000	So it would mean that if you if you did that, there'd be less of a problem in terms of dealing with the complexity that you're talking about. And the fact that I think that this is just what I think, I have no idea whether this would be the case or not.
4842000	4860000	That there'd be more, as it were, production would be more localized, not everything, of course, but more localized. So things that could be produced locally, probably would be produced locally, rather than being shipped across the world, because it could be produced slightly more cheaply
4860000	4889000	there, since you pay people less there, and so on, you'd get rid of all that. And I don't actually see complexity as a problem, really. It's, it's something that that obviously exists in modern society and will exist in all societies. But I don't see why it can't be dealt with by people having, as it were, been transformed by I mean, one argument that sometimes is, is, is, you know,
4890000	4907000	is used against participation as well. Maybe lots of people don't want to participate, or maybe they're not able to participate. But the point is that if you have never had the chance of participating running anything, then you probably don't want to get involved in it.
4907000	4926000	Bit like participation wash. If what you do makes no difference, why bother? And so people learn by what they, by their life experience. And if they have life experience of different sorts, then they have a wider basis of experience to draw upon when thinking about things.
4926000	4936000	Now, this probably doesn't dispose of your elephant, but I think it is, that's how I think about it anyway.
4936000	4961000	Well, it doesn't completely dissolve the problem, I'd say. So there's still some kind of elephant there, I'd say. And this is not because I wouldn't share like most of your arguments. I just think that, that they even taken together do not yet address, like the complexity of the problem itself.
4961000	4985000	Because I mean, at the end, one like essential question would be how to draw the line. If you say that, okay, not everybody has to be involved in everything. And being like affected in a tiny bit by something does not really immediately lead to the necessity of you being involved in the process.
4985000	5013000	Then, I mean, the immediately the question comes up, okay, but what is the parameter? What is the, what is the way in which this distinction is being made? Because if we stick to the example of a computer, then despite the fact that we do have a lot of meetings in capitalism as well, and all the arguments that you just gave, there's still at the end is the very concrete question that if the principle in general is that if you're involved in the process, then what is the parameter?
5015000	5044000	If you're being affected by some of the elements that are involved in the production of a computer, then you will have to be involved within the process as such, then the problem still exists if we do not like have some kind of idea of how to define this threshold, so to speak, of how much being
5044000	5071000	one necessarily being involved within a process or decision making process and stuff like that. And the question then is if there are like 30 different interests being represented within the board of a given production unit, then how to argue that the 31st should then not be included.
5071000	5090000	I mean, there needs to be some kind of principle to draw a line of when something counts as being affected, because it's just a very like a question of principles as much as practice, you know?
5090000	5119000	Well, I don't know. I don't really know what to say about that. I mean, at the moment, you've described the complexity of the inputs into making a computer. Okay, obviously, that's the case. Now, I suppose I would see that as a lower level decision than the decision as to whether or not one wants to have a computer made
5119000	5146000	in the first place. So there's been a lot of work done, less fashionable now than it used to be at some time, about the way in which technical progress, although it can't be predicted in advance the form it's going to take, but the direction in which it goes is shaped by the dominant interests in the society.
5146000	5168000	So, for example, there's a lot of discussion now about social media or YouTube or whatever. Now, some people argue that these technologies are technologies that just develop almost independently, neutrally, they're just technologies that's there to be sort of discovered or created or whatever.
5168000	5197000	Rather than the alternative view is that these technologies are developed in ways that suit or contribute to the existing ethos, the existing ways of things happening under capitalism. So I think at that level, there would be decisions about the direction in which one wanted technology to be developed.
5197000	5212000	Where did technology to go? Not the detail, because one can't predict that, but the direction in which one wants to go. Where does one want to put resources for future technological developments? Which teams of the sort that you're talking about?
5212000	5227000	Does one want to support? And presumably, big companies do that all the time. They have to decide, are they going to favor this technique or that technique, or this direction of development or that direction of development?
5227000	5243000	Once that decision has been made, and the resources to finance it have been made available, then it's not up to the people who are making those decisions to actually implement it. It's up to the people who know about the structure.
5243000	5260000	So that's where, I mean, at a simple level, social owners would decide, just as the boards of directors do with private capitalist companies now, overall sort of priorities for the company or for the enterprise.
5260000	5271000	But then it would be the people who work in the enterprise, who would be the ones who say, OK, this is what we need to be doing. This is what we need to be going. How are we going to do that?
5271000	5286000	And then if they then come up with ideas for something new, they can put that. So you get two way flow of information. And that doesn't mean to say you wouldn't have specialist teams like the sort that you're talking about.
5286000	5292000	And of course, at one level, you know, if the butterfly stamps here, somebody dies across the other side of the world.
5292000	5305000	But I mean, that sort of degree of involvement is not the sort of involvement that I have in mind, maybe wrongly when it comes to thinking about social ownership.
5305000	5325000	I think of it as it were major categories of interests like consumers or workers. And when it comes to workers, I mean, I would and I do in my book say, well, of course, the main people who are going to be affected in implementing something are the
5325000	5341000	workers in the enterprise concerned once the overall decisions by the social owners at the, if you like, board of directors or whatever level has reached their decisions.
5341000	5346000	But then it's up to the workers in the enterprise to see how they can be best implemented.
5346000	5361000	But in a sense, it's not just up to the workers in that enterprise, because the workers in the enterprise might say, well, you know, we want to make sure that this thing that we're working on is going to take off.
5361000	5368000	And therefore, we will cut wages by 20% so that it can be sold more cheaply.
5368000	5383000	Now, that would then have an effect on other workers. And therefore, as well as the workers in the enterprise itself, being represented as part of the social owners, you probably in a more minor way.
5383000	5395000	I'd say trade unions represented so that they could say, come on, you can't just cut workers that would be setting up wages, you can't be setting a precedent for everywhere else.
5395000	5409000	We can't do that. And so they'd argue the case. So in other words, I always have found it difficult to go beyond the general principles, because I think that would have to be learned by doing.
5409000	5419000	Rather than pretty just prescribed in advance. I think the general principles, I'm fairly clear on and you seem to be happy with them too.
5419000	5426000	How they actually work out in practice in detail.
5426000	5433000	I can't I can't foretell that that would have to be worked out by the people who are doing it.
5433000	5446000	Yeah, I guess my position would be that I think there are still some open questions in terms of the general principles as well, because they cannot that easily be separated from the practical implementation.
5446000	5454000	That would be one point, I guess. And I mean, that's where, for example, modern information and communication technologies come into play.
5454000	5460000	Or the question of formalizing a bit more how people would actually be involved.
5460000	5477000	What kind of decision making processes would be implemented in order to still provide this absolutely understandable benefit of having people that are affected by something being able to participate within the process, which I totally agree with.
5477000	5486000	But still doing it in a way that kind of is aware of the practical implementation of the whole process as such.
5486000	5501000	And I mean, one one thing that, as I said, immediately immediately pops up would be the question of how could like modern information and communication technologies maybe assist within this process?
5501000	5521000	Because this in a world which is like highly diverse, highly interconnected and in which some processes of production are necessarily international and not local, this kind of needs to be addressed in some way, shape or form, I would say.
5521000	5527000	And yeah, I mean, that's something I am absolutely interested in.
5527000	5549000	The question of how could this maybe be technologically mediated in a meaningful way, not in a way which kind of eliminates the essential features of the thing, but assists with the handling of complexity when it comes to this.
5549000	5563000	Yeah, you addressed it as too many meetings problem, and I do understand some of the arguments that you give against it, but still there is a rest of open questions when it comes to the question of complexity.
5563000	5580000	And yeah, I'm asking myself how to, as I said, kind of maybe try to mediate it in a technological way that is really meaningful and not like stupidly deterministic, so to speak.
5580000	5587000	Well, I think we probably have to leave this issue there because I can see.
5587000	5596000	Well, I mean, first of all, in terms of international, the fact that I envisage
5596000	5605000	production being much more localized than it currently is doesn't mean to say I don't envisage there being some international exchange trade and so on.
5605000	5608000	So it's not complete autarky I'm talking about at all.
5608000	5626000	And then the only other thing to say, which I've already said, is that within the sort of broad frameworks that are determined at a higher level, at a lower level, it's the people who are actually involved in doing it, who would have to work things out.
5626000	5644000	And within that, I mean, I not myself had experience of that, but I imagine that if you decided to make a computer in this way, rather than that way, that would affect some people more than others, because some people have the skills for this way, but not for that way.
5644000	5657000	And, you know, it may be that people like you're talking about communication and so on, you know, that people have inputs into a process that they can put in from a distance.
5657000	5670000	And so, I mean, all that seems to me to be the level of detailed implementation, rather than the overall framework and set of principles that one wants to apply.
5670000	5679000	So, of course, in some sense, almost every decision anybody makes will have some impact on other people.
5679000	5692000	So it's a way of, as it were, on the one hand, deciding on the major minor groups that are going to be affected or individuals that are going to be affected at a lower level.
5692000	5718000	And on the other hand, recognizing that I don't think we can predict in advance how these things are going to be resolved, other than to draw upon the undoubted sort of experience of technology under capitalism that happened as a result of people cooperating and skills and so on.
5718000	5731000	But, you know, we could go back to Lenin, who I remember said that socialism can be built through Soviets on the one hand and electrification on the other.
5731000	5737000	But he wasn't concerned about the details of the electrification.
5737000	5744000	He was just concerned about the fact that what it did was provide a source of energy that could then be used.
5745000	5747000	So anyway, that's an aside.
5747000	5756000	I mean, I hope it's all right if I have some pressing questions that we hopefully can cover, even though I already have taken up a lot of your time.
5756000	5758000	No, no, it's absolutely fine.
5759000	5780000	Because, I mean, there are some very general questions concerning a model that I do have as well, because you kind of said, all right, the details, they will have to be produced, evolved, negotiated within the process, which I do understand, even though, as I said, I have some elephants.
5781000	5787000	Some of my elephants might be bigger than yours, but I have some general questions as well.
5787000	5797000	And one of those is addressing the kind of implicit anthropology, so to speak, that your model holds.
5797000	5802000	I kind of labeled it Homo negotiatus and Homo activus.
5802000	5803000	You did, yes.
5803000	5818000	Because, I mean, there is this specific idea, this specific image that your model relies on heavily, and that is the image of, and I quote you here, self-activating, self-determining individuals, end quote.
5818000	5824000	And these self-activating, self-determining individuals should have control over their lives.
5824000	5838000	And this image, it has a quite humanistic ring to it, I would say, and a strong belief into reason as the foundational and guiding principle of not only the political, but also the economic structures.
5838000	5849000	And this is kind of, at least that was my impression, the point where the pluralism that you promote, the pluralism of your model actually collapses.
5849000	5867000	Because since the whole thing is based upon the idea of everybody being involved, everybody would have to somewhat commit to this ideal and not only commit to it, actually, but also incorporate it into the deepest levels of one's personality.
5867000	5885000	And I was asking myself if there isn't some kind of essentialism at play here in which it is assumed that what everybody truly wants is to actively participate in all of this and to be this specific type of person.
5885000	5893000	And during our interview, you already mentioned that there is, of course, this aspect of division of labor.
5893000	5912000	And if this is overcome, then we would be able to learn different ways of approaching different kinds of skills, different kinds of labels, et cetera, and that this would also lead to a kind of development, also an internal development.
5912000	5939000	And I do understand that point, and I think it's very valid, but I doubt that this addresses the underlying universalism within the assumption that given this development, at the end, everybody would want to participate and want to be this specific homo sapiens that you imagine as a basis for your model.
5939000	5954000	I mean, I think you put it in the question, something like the tension between interdependence and autonomy, and I just don't see that they are incompatible.
5954000	5973000	I think no man is an island, no person is an island, and we are shaped by our interaction with other people, by our social experience through our lives.
5973000	5986000	And the idea that there is some essentialist characteristics of homo sapiens is it depends how you interpret that.
5986000	6008000	I mean, my partner is a developmental psychologist and a linguist, and she has this very interesting issue associated with Chomsky, which on the one hand, he's got his sort of politics, broadly speaking, with which we agree.
6008000	6026000	But on the other hand, in terms of language, his view apparently, and I'm no expert on this, his view apparently is that language is innately pre-wired.
6026000	6039000	So it's part of the essential makeup of human beings, which is why all language, although it takes different forms, is basically the same and has the same structure.
6039000	6051000	And it's independent of the input. It's just there. And different inputs cause it to come out in different ways, but nevertheless, it's there.
6051000	6077000	So this is a sort of innatist view of language. Now the other way of thinking about it, which is the one that my partner belongs to, is that, of course, nobody would deny that there is an innate capacity for human beings to learn language in a way that no other species has learned it.
6077000	6092000	So that's not just by accident. It's because things have evolved to make that possible. So in that sense, language is innate, but the form it takes depends upon the input that people hear.
6092000	6113000	And that shapes, and that's why you've got very, very different forms of language. And the debate between the two schools, of course, is between, you know, one school saying, well, yeah, yeah, but you can always interpret your findings of listening to how children learn to talk and so on in your way, but we can interpret it in our way.
6113000	6135000	And that's how it goes. So I think that it's a sort of false opposition to talk about autonomy and interdependence as being incompatible. I think that whether we like it or not, we are all interdependent.
6135000	6152000	And I actually do quite like it. I mean, I wouldn't like to be a hermit and be totally isolated, but that's neither here nor there. It's really that there are forms of interdependence, which are usually oppressive and alienating.
6152000	6178000	And there are forms of interdependence, which are liberating and humanizing. And so I don't really see that it's a real problem, the way you've put it. If people haven't had the chance of interdependent activity in which they feel that what they're doing makes a difference, as I said before, they'll think, well, what's the point?
6178000	6200000	And if they don't have to do it all their lives, because you don't have this social division of labor, so you can move from one thing to another. You can move from being as many people in our society do, being a professional to being a manager, and sometimes then to being a capitalist.
6200000	6224000	But the other form of interdependence is interdependence of the working class movement, the labor movement, which is solidarity, support, cooperation. And I think those two forms, if you like, are learned through the experience you go through and the circumstances you find yourselves in.
6224000	6250000	So I don't really think that is a problem, as I see it. I go back to Marx's distinction, again in the critique of the Goethe program, between what he calls the lower and the higher stages of communism, with the lower stage having come to be called socialism and the higher stage communism.
6250000	6275000	But he talks about the lower and the higher stages of communism. And his point is that the lower stage of communism, i.e. after you get rid of capitalism, and you move to a socialist as opposed to a communist society, which he describes as from each according to ability.
6275000	6304000	So you contribute what you can to each according to work. So you're rewarded in terms of how much you put in to the collective well-being. And that is because he thinks that at that stage, on the one hand, productivity hasn't reached the stage where there's enough to produce an equal amount for everything, for everybody.
6305000	6328000	Who needs it. So, but the other point about that is that when we move from capitalism to post capitalism, we are shaped by our experience of capitalism and all the prejudices, ways of thinking and so on and so forth that we take with us have been shaped by that form of society.
6328000	6345000	And so socialism or the lower stage of communism, as he puts it, is a process of, on the one hand, making sure that there's the ability to produce enough to satisfy needs.
6345000	6360000	And on the other hand, the slogan is from each according to ability, we all do what we can, we put into the collective pot. But we get not what we put in the equivalent of what we put in, but what we need.
6360000	6387000	So from each according to ability to each according to need and need then depends upon, well, what counts as what you need to contribute to human flourishing and much of what is consumed and people think they need under capitalism, probably most increasingly people would agree doesn't actually contribute to human flourishing.
6387000	6404000	So, you know, there's a problem of obesity. There's a problem of the sales where shops say there's one big prize that you can get, but half price, but there's only one.
6404000	6422000	So people go up in advance, sometimes for days, in hope of getting this one prize and only one person can get it. And the thousands of others have been queuing up don't get it so they feel they've lost out, they discontented capitalism generates discontent.
6422000	6442000	So you've got to, you've got to contribute to, you've got to think about what used to be perhaps it is called abundance enough to satisfy everybody's needs, not just in terms of how much can be produced, but also in terms of how much counts, or what counts as contributing to human
6442000	6461000	wellbeing, what counts as needs. And so from that way, I think that some people may choose not to want to participate, but they've got to have the opportunity and the encouragement and the experience to enable them to do so if they'd like to.
6461000	6475000	And I don't see any reason why people wouldn't want to be involved in taking decisions that have major effects on their lives. But who knows? That's a learning process. I mean, we'll discover that by what happens.
6476000	6495000	You touched upon many different things that I would like to follow up on. The first thing would be a clarification. I absolutely agree that the dichotomy of interdependence on the one hand and individual autonomy on the other hand, I do not share this as well.
6495000	6514000	That was not the point that I was getting at with my question before. It was more addressed towards what you said at the end of your answer. And this kind of touches upon the question of compulsion to work as well.
6514000	6537000	Because at the end, you said, okay, some people might not choose to participate. And this could mean participate in the process of democratically negotiating the goals of one's society or mode of production or whatever. But it might also include choosing not to work at all.
6537000	6563000	And this is another question that I have concerning your model, because at some point within our talk today, you mentioned that there is no unearned income. And you directed it towards people who might profit from private capital. But there is also the question of whether there is or is not some form of universal basic income.
6563000	6582000	And I assume that this income will come additional to what I assume to be unconditional basic services that provide base amount of infrastructure for everybody, which I definitely see included in your thinking and the way you sketch your model.
6582000	6604000	And with that, you seem to think that it is a necessary component of this type of model that people are kind of, quote unquote, forced to work through this trade-off of working and then receiving some kind of remuneration.
6604000	6628000	Because this is kind of connected to the question that I had before when it comes to whether or not there is some idea of universal expectation towards the individuals to be this specific type of human.
6628000	6648000	Human, you know, this specific type of human that is self-reflective, active, engaged, participating and stuff like that. You know, this is kind of the ground material of your model and you build your institutions, the whole setup around this idea of how
6648000	6667000	the individual human sees itself in relation to others, in relation to oneself and stuff like that. But I would argue, as you touched upon briefly in your last answer, that many people might function very differently.
6667000	6680000	You know, they might not fit into this idea of active subject, active individual and stuff like that. And I would argue that there is a benefit in this as well.
6680000	6706000	And that they, and this is like the long circle I'm kind of making, connecting these two questions. And I would argue this leads us into an area where there should not be some kind of first phase, second phase kind of distinction where in the first phase the work is connected to some kind of wage.
6706000	6722000	And that you necessarily are, quote unquote, forced to work in order to get some kind of existence beyond basic, basic, basic needs. I'm not sure if this was understandable at all, the question.
6722000	6740000	No, I mean, I think I would see that there would be a general expectation that people should contribute to the collective well-being of society, which includes themselves and other people.
6740000	6754000	By taking part in economic activity, which creates the things that people need to flourish as human beings.
6754000	6771000	And so I think that this does connect to the idea that we can't really go that far in thinking about how human beings might become if they lived in a completely different sort of society.
6771000	6788000	I mean, you know, anthropologists have looked at whether there ever was a society based upon what Marx and Engels called primitive communism, where there was a subsistence society.
6788000	6801000	It produced to use itself, not to sell and its expectations as to what was possible were formed by what was possible, given it was subsistence.
6801000	6813000	So that was their expectations. Now, in a complex society, like any modern society, what people need, it partly depends upon how those needs are shaped.
6813000	6818000	As I've already said, but it also depends on their different circumstances.
6818000	6828000	And I think in any civilized society, you wouldn't have a situation where large numbers of children go hungry.
6828000	6841000	So you'd have to have a situation where families were able to access enough and therefore command enough resources to make sure that children flourish.
6841000	6850000	And similarly, old people and ill people without themselves in any given moment contributing to society.
6850000	6859000	So that's why people have pensions. They're no longer contributing society, but they have contributed to society in the past.
6859000	6868000	So what I think you're talking about is supposing there are people who say, no, I'd just rather lie on the beach all day and not do any work to contribute to anything.
6868000	6877000	Now, OK, I mean, there might be such people, but I think it's very unlikely, given social norms that would prevail and so on.
6877000	6887000	You might say, well, I want to, as you said yourself, you want to do these interviews and you wouldn't want anybody else to tell you who to interview and who not.
6887000	6891000	Fine. Why not? I don't think my model would have any problems with that.
6891000	6901000	So long as you didn't necessarily feel that you had to in order to obtain what you needed to survive in the way that you wanted to survive.
6901000	6909000	You didn't feel that if you couldn't do that from your interviews, then you'd get it from somewhere else.
6909000	6913000	So you'd have to that have to be a way of thinking, well, if people want to do.
6913000	6918000	Well, first of all, there would be a lot more spare time so you could do it in your spare time.
6918000	6922000	Secondly, you wouldn't have to have anybody telling you what to do if you want to do it.
6922000	6927000	You do it, you know, if you need resources. Well, you can get hold of those resources.
6927000	6931000	You know about technology could get hold of computers and all the rest of it.
6931000	6935000	You'd have to have the wherewithal to do that, of course.
6935000	6954000	And but if you in your spare time were contributing to it one way or another, I mean, there used to be there still is this organization called Wages for Housework because housework is contributing to the collective well-being.
6954000	6959000	It's not properly shared between typically men and women over at the moment, but never mind.
6959000	6969000	If it were shared, it would obviously count as socially necessary activity and all sorts of things like you're doing might well count similarly.
6969000	6973000	So I don't think there's any any real problem about that.
6973000	6998000	I think there would be a problem in the sense that there might be a sort of form of social disapproval if somebody chose to lie on a beach all day, but not if they were doing some creative fact that contributed in one way or another to human well-being and not just their own.
6998000	7014000	So we could use the term that is sometimes used about, say, when in the UK members of the royal family, which is that they're parasites because they don't do anything useful and yet they live in luxury.
7014000	7027000	Now, not everybody would agree with that because some people think they do do something useful that they, you know, they have a figurehead and the Queen is very popular and she's supposed to hold things together and so on.
7027000	7046000	But what I'm trying to get at is if people are doing something, if choose to do something that is actually, let's call it parasitic on what other people do and what they depend upon is what other people produce in order for them to depend upon it.
7046000	7056000	Well, you know, there may be such people, I think it's unlikely that there'd be many people who felt like that in a different form of society with a different set of values.
7056000	7071000	So I think my view about about that would be there would be, on the one hand, basic services, which would everybody could have access to, and which people would be able just about to live on as a sort of not in poverty.
7072000	7092000	But otherwise, if they wanted more than that, then they would probably have to have some accounting system to say, well, we are contributing something and then have to be a collective social political decision at different levels of the society about what is allowed to be counted as that and what isn't.
7092000	7110000	So people who want to spend their time as artists, why not? That does contribute to human well-being. People who want to spend their time, I don't know, as I've said, just for the sake of being able to think of anything else, sort of lie on the beach all day.
7110000	7123000	Well, okay, if they want to do that, fine, but they shouldn't really expect to have more, if you like, than basic necessities for living a decent life.
7123000	7152000	I mean, I think these things would all have to be worked out. And it's very difficult to come to any answer other than I would expect the norm would be, I may be wrong, of course, but I would expect the norm to be that people would feel that they needed to and possibly even wanted to make a contribution to the collective well-being of society, including themselves.
7152000	7181000	I'm not sure, but I think there's a deep level misunderstanding going on here because I absolutely agree with this. I'm absolutely not at all on the side of those who try to sketch such a society as a problem of some people being parasitic or anything as such.
7181000	7209000	I'm absolutely not on this side. I'm at the opposite side. I would argue for decoupling of very good living standards for everybody and the question of work, because I absolutely agree that most people would be prone to do stuff and to be helpful and to bring some knowledge, some skill into the reproduction of society as a whole.
7209000	7235000	So I absolutely agree with that. The thing is that coming from this place of actually pushing it even further, I do think that the heavy reliance on a specific idea of self-activating and self-determining individual,
7235000	7263000	that we actually would need a plurality of perspective on humans as such within this category as well. That was kind of the thing I was heading at, is that I do value people who are not active as well, because I think that they might bring in different skills.
7263000	7282000	There's a value to passiveness as well, because people who are not this self-activating individual that is always self-conscious and reflective and rational, this is a very specific idea of what a human being might be.
7282000	7296000	And I think there's a whole plethora of different ways of seeing oneself and acting oneself, etc. that is very, very, very much valuable as well.
7296000	7325000	I'm still not sure I've completely grasped your position, because I think that in the sort of society that I have in mind, there would be plenty of space and time for people as individuals or maybe as small groups of individuals to do their own thing.
7325000	7346000	I think the only proviso for that would be if all they wanted to do was their own thing, and that was judged more collectively as not contributing to the collective wellbeing.
7346000	7359000	They could do it, but if that's all they wanted to do and didn't want any part of what they did to contribute in whatever way to what was judged to be part of the collectivity, I think that would be a problem.
7359000	7365000	And I think that that would be regarded as not playing the game, if you like.
7365000	7386000	But I think the whole point about the society that I look forward to is that everybody would contribute to what was needed for human flourishing, but there would then be plenty of time left over for them to do whatever else they wanted to do.
7386000	7398000	But if they didn't want in any way to contribute to the collective good, then it seems to me it would be a problem and would be disapproved of, at least I would disapprove of it.
7398000	7405000	I don't know whether other people would, because I think that we have a collective responsibility for one another.
7405000	7418000	And therefore, I'm happy for people to do things that so long as they're not destructive in whatever spare time as if everyone wants to use the term spare time or free time.
7418000	7429000	But on the other hand, I mean, lots of people actually love the work they do. And lots of people in our society don't love the work they do because it's not intrinsically rewarding or valuable.
7429000	7434000	It might actually be socially valuable, but it's not rewarding necessarily individually.
7434000	7446000	So I think I don't really think there is a problem unless you are suggesting that some people might want to be parasitic on what the other people are doing.
7446000	7450000	And I think I would I would think that that would meet with social disapproval.
7451000	7458000	So long as they do contribute and then the rest of the time they do what the hell they like, which is not destructive, that's absolutely fine.
7458000	7477000	Indeed, that's the whole point of the society to both try to create a situation where the work that needs to be done to produce what's needed for civilized flourishing human being leading a decent life doesn't take up everybody's time.
7477000	7482000	And therefore there's plenty of time left to do all sorts of other things we might be lying on the beach.
7482000	7501000	Maybe a different way to maybe demonstrate what I what I mean is the question of if negotiated coordination is the mechanism with which these things are being mediated between each other.
7501000	7508000	So you have the production unit, you have the coordination bodies, you have the planning committees, et cetera, et cetera.
7508000	7522000	And in all of these instances, as far as I understood your model, there would be processes of negotiation involved in order to produce a collectively decided upon outcome.
7522000	7524000	That's how I understood it.
7524000	7536000	And my point is that this is a very specific mode, a specific relay between these institutions, these layers of institutions.
7536000	7554000	And this relay, this mechanism, this medium does suit specific types of persons, specific types of rationalities, specific types of qualities and qualifications better than others.
7554000	7568000	So if we have people who have what in German is called Sitzfleisch, which are just like really fucking stubborn and they want their will to get through and they will like push their head through the wall and stuff like that.
7568000	7571000	And they might be like overly aggressive doing so.
7571000	7581000	And so they dominate the group in a very bad way in a way that is not supporting the complete group.
7581000	7590000	And this is something that you will actually experience in groups that are self-organizing quite often.
7590000	7606000	That there's some asshole which kind of pulls the energy of the room to himself, mostly men, and is being very dominant and is actually sorry for my French, fucking up the whole process.
7606000	7635000	And the point would be that if negotiated coordination is the one relay, the one medium to transmit, to organize, to mediate, etc., then this is reducing the ways in which different qualities of people, different qualities of information, etc.
7635000	7637000	can be transmitted.
7637000	7640000	There's a relation between the two.
7640000	7650000	If there is a homo passivus, they might really lose out within the meeting where everybody decides on how things should go along.
7650000	7656000	Because she or he is the homo passivus and he's not bringing forward his position.
7656000	7660000	Maybe he's not reflected or he's not self-conscious or whatever.
7660000	7675000	It's just the point that there's a variety of different valuable subjectivities and not all of them lie themselves naturally to a process of negotiated coordination.
7675000	7677000	I guess that would be the point.
7677000	7680000	I now understand what you're saying.
7680000	7690000	I'm sure you obviously have and I obviously have met people like that who try to dominate things or they're just like that.
7690000	7694000	They're pushing themselves forward all the time for whatever reason.
7694000	7697000	So there are two things to be said about that.
7697000	7704000	I have to say that one is undoubtedly that at the moment can be a problem.
7704000	7709000	But if somebody is chairing a meeting, you can usually keep such people under control.
7709000	7713000	Not always, but you can usually keep them under control.
7713000	7726000	And interestingly enough, in my experience, it's been easier to do that face to face than online.
7726000	7730000	The only way you can do it online in the end is just to cut them off.
7731000	7733000	But you don't want to do that.
7733000	7737000	So face to face, you just say, no, look, come on, we've got to let other people have their turn.
7737000	7739000	You know, endless ways of doing it.
7739000	7741000	So that's the first thing to be said.
7741000	7745000	That sort of behavior can be kept under control and you can.
7745000	7756000	And one of the skills of actually being a teacher is to find ways of bringing in people who tend to just sit there or be passive.
7757000	7762000	In fact, one of the things you really have to do if you're a good teacher is to find a way of doing that.
7762000	7770000	But the second thing is, although you get people who do behave that way at the moment,
7770000	7776000	I would expect that there'd be far fewer of them in a different society.
7776000	7782000	I wouldn't know how could I know whether they would disappear completely.
7782000	7791000	But given the fact on the one hand that I think they can be kept under control by somebody who's chairing the meeting.
7791000	7794000	And on the other hand, I think there'd be far fewer of them.
7794000	7802000	I can't see that that's going to be a big problem that they would behave in such a way as to prevent the tacit knowledge of other people
7802000	7807000	or the passive knowledge of other people from coming forth or being drawn forth.
7808000	7811000	So I can see the point you're making.
7811000	7818000	And it obviously is a point that, as I say, we've all experienced people like that.
7818000	7821000	But I don't see it as being insuperable.
7821000	7836000	Yeah, I guess I would still stick to the point that I would only stick to the point that I would argue for a plurality of methods as well.
7836000	7842000	I mean, the idea of negotiated coordination, I do understand absolutely.
7842000	7847000	And I do think this is a very, very valuable and essential part of the whole thing.
7847000	7863000	I just do think that we need like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 different other methods that accompany negotiated coordination in order to make things work at the end.
7863000	7866000	And I guess that's your point as well.
7866000	7869000	Give us an example of what one of these other methods might be.
7869000	7874000	I mean, one of them, and this has nothing to do with tacit knowledge, I guess.
7874000	7881000	One of them would be the use of modern information and communication technology.
7881000	7884000	But it's not only that. It's not only that.
7884000	7900000	It's also that if someone does have an intuition, so to speak, in terms of something that might well be useful for some kind of purpose,
7900000	7910000	but this person is not very good in talking, not very good in communicating with other humans,
7910000	7918000	is like in general very much not suited for negotiated coordination as a person.
7918000	7931000	You know, they do not, the way that they are set up does not lend itself nicely to this mode of coordinating things like negotiated coordination.
7931000	7945000	Then I would say it might very well be that this person could bring rich things or ideas or whatever it might be at the end into the world,
7945000	7952000	even though he or she might not be suited for this mechanism of negotiated coordination.
7952000	7962000	And then the question would be, how would this person acquire, for example, the resources to bring into the world
7962000	7969000	whatever he or she might want to produce if this road is not hers or his?
7969000	7976000	No, I can see that. I was going to say that if somebody has an intuition,
7976000	7982000	there's no reason in the way I see the world, I envisage things.
7982000	7985000	There's no reason why they shouldn't follow that intuition.
7985000	7995000	The only way in which the problems that you're raising might arise is if in order to follow them, they need to do so collectively.
7995000	8004000	And that's to say they need to involve other people and they can't convince other people that their intuition is worth following.
8004000	8010000	Well, I can see that that could be a problem. But I mean, I don't really think that that's insuperable.
8010000	8021000	I mean, in subsequent discussions and things that Fikret and I have written, I mean, one of the things that we've thought of is that you could have
8021000	8032000	and other people have come up with similar ideas, you could have, for example, a body like a research council that people could apply to
8032000	8038000	and say, look, I've got this idea and I don't know whether it will work or not, but I need some resources.
8038000	8049000	So just like when you apply for a research grant, but if you want to have access to collective resources,
8049000	8062000	then there's got to be some way of the collective reaching a view on whether that's a worthwhile use of those resources.
8062000	8074000	Now, some people in dealing with this issue have suggested that everybody should have a certain allowance of resources, if you like,
8074000	8084000	that they could use in whatever way they like or make available for anybody else to use on their behalf.
8084000	8092000	That's one way of thinking about it. So there are a number of ways in which you can think about how do people get access to resources
8092000	8100000	if they can't really convince anybody that they should be able to use collective resources for that purpose.
8100000	8104000	And maybe there isn't such a maybe there is no way of doing that.
8104000	8108000	I mean, it would that would be a form of total autarky.
8108000	8122000	You could use social resources just because you wanted to, which would be fine if you could manage to devise a system,
8122000	8132000	which could include, of course, convincing other people that even though the outcome of your intuition is unpredictable, it's worth following.
8132000	8139000	So I think you may be you may be worrying about an issue which can't be solved.
8139000	8142000	But that may not be true. I don't know.
8142000	8151000	There are people who have, as I said, tried to devise ways of making resources available to do even if you can't convince anybody else,
8151000	8159000	like the fact that everybody would have an allowance that they could give to themselves or convey to other people.
8159000	8164000	Yeah. And I guess it's a problem that is not like unique to your model.
8164000	8173000	So it's it will come up in general if we want to decide about how to spend the resources.
8173000	8181000	Yeah. OK. So how should we approach it if we would want to bring into existence negotiated coordination?
8181000	8187000	What would be the experiments, the next steps like how would a transformation go about?
8187000	8189000	How should we approach it?
8189000	8200000	Well, for me, I think that would involve the question of the unresolved question in my mind and I think still unresolved.
8200000	8210000	What is the political process through which we have to go in order to go beyond capitalism?
8210000	8216000	Because you couldn't have negotiated coordination of the sort that I have in mind within capitalism.
8216000	8221000	So how do we get beyond capitalism?
8221000	8227000	I don't know if you've come across the work of this woman in America called Jody Dean.
8227000	8233000	Her three most interesting, well, three that I've been most interested in books.
8233000	8239000	First of all, the one she called Communist Horizon, the Communist Horizon.
8239000	8254000	And what she means by that is the horizon is a metaphor because horizons are a distinction between what you can see and what you can't see beyond.
8254000	8263000	And the communist horizon is seen beyond what you can't see to what you she would like to see, which is communism.
8263000	8277000	And that term distinguishes the communist view because it's a sharp discontinuity between what we've got and what we would like to move towards from social
8277000	8291000	democracy or all these improvements within capitalism, the commons and horizontalism and crack capitalism and all these things that are around.
8291000	8298000	So that's the first thing. And the second one is her book called Crowds and Parties.
8298000	8315000	Crowds are what happens when you get these manifestations like the Occupy movement in New York or mass demonstrations against a nuclear power station or a new oil field or whatever.
8315000	8326000	And they come and go and they're crowds and they have a power and they carry people with them, people involved in them think, great, this is the future.
8326000	8330000	But of course, it never is because it comes and then it goes.
8330000	8342000	So what she what she argues is what you need is a party that has a continuity, learns, has a history and so on.
8342000	8349000	And the her third book is what the Americans called called Comrades.
8349000	8352000	We call them comrades, but never mind.
8352000	8368000	And and there she's she's trying to draw a distinction between friends who you can disagree with, but are still friends, family, likewise, neighbors, and so on.
8368000	8377000	Again, allies, but comrades are people who share the same values and vision that you have.
8377000	8387000	And she gets this, of course, from her study of parties and comrades then are people who you don't have to be friends with, you don't have to like.
8387000	8395000	But if you're committed to the same project, then you enter into a sort of sense of mutual obligation.
8395000	8400000	Your comrades, you expect something from other comrades and they expect something from you.
8400000	8407000	So this is just a rather convoluted way of saying a political process of how you get there.
8407000	8419000	And here we move on to a different field altogether, which is my current sort of vision of the political process is basically a Gramscian approach.
8420000	8426000	Because Gramsci has this idea that there will always be crises.
8426000	8438000	There are small scale crises, but then there are what he calls an organic crisis, which is where the ruling class can no longer continue to rule in the same way that they have been ruling in the past.
8438000	8443000	They don't only rule in the developed capitalist countries by force.
8443000	8451000	They also rule by consent through hegemony and so on of ruling class ideas.
8451000	8457000	And when it comes to an organic crisis, then there's a war of what he calls maneuver.
8457000	8461000	There's a war of how the crisis is going to be resolved.
8461000	8490000	And his argument is that the outcome of that war depends upon the previous war of position, which is a long process, probably of decades, in which there is a movement to try and create on the one hand a counter hegemony, an alternative way of trying to link everything together from the ruling class.
8490000	8516000	But on the other hand, equally importantly, if not more importantly, there is the creation of in various sort of cooperative, associative, prefigurative ways, institutions of one sort or another, which can then be drawn upon when it comes to the war of maneuver.
8516000	8535000	And he got this idea. He developed this idea. You probably know all about this, but he developed this idea when he was thinking about why was it that the Russian Revolution succeeded, but the Hungarian Revolution, the German Revolution, the other European revolutions didn't succeed.
8535000	8561000	And his analysis was that in Russia, with a relatively underdeveloped civil society, all the Bolsheviks needed to do was to see state power, which they managed to do, and then set about, if you like, creating the socialist consciousness, which was needed to build a different form of society.
8561000	8576000	Whereas in Germany, in particular, there was a well-developed civil society in which ruling class ideas held sway, even though they were not part of the state.
8576000	8591000	And so although the revolutions looked at if they might succeed, and of course, in the Soviet Union, they hoped they would succeed because they didn't think they could build socialism alone in one country, but they didn't succeed.
8591000	8608000	And Grouchy's view was that was because the war of position, preparations building up to the revolution hadn't happened to the same extent because of the strength of civil society, which was imbued by ruling class ideas.
8608000	8620000	So that's where this, I think that's where his view of the war of position. So that's how I see things at the moment. I mean, you can't automatically apply something that was developed.
8620000	8631000	Well, probably 90 years ago, or the rudiments of it to today, but nevertheless, it's a very interesting way, I think, of thinking about things.
8631000	8648000	So that, I think, is what I would look to if I was thinking of, well, how can we move towards a post-capitalist society where negotiated coordination and social ownership has a chance of working?
8648000	8658000	I do have one question that I ask all of my guests, and that would be, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
8661000	8676000	Yes, that was your last question. Yes. It's a very good question. I was talking to Elaine and my partner about this, and we thought there might be a problem in thinking about the answer,
8676000	8686000	which was what might happen in the future that isn't currently happening. Or does it mean,
8688000	8697000	is there anything in the future that will continue to be in the future that you would particularly continue to find joyful?
8698000	8715000	And we weren't quite sure which of those two ways of thinking about it. I mean, if it's the second, if it's something that I look forward to in the future, and it currently does happen, and I really appreciate it,
8715000	8734000	and I find it joyful to see it continuing to happen, it would be, on the one hand, sort of the human resilience and creativity, and on the other hand, it would be the joys of experiencing non-human nature.
8734000	8747000	There's been some wonderful programs on our television, one by David Attenborough, who's always brilliant, and the other is a program which follows the seasons.
8747000	8768000	We've just been watching Winter Watch, and they have eight episodes of it where they've got people dotted around the country photographing or observing, showing you all sorts of wildlife in action, which is absolutely wonderful.
8768000	8786000	So that's one side of it. If it was what would make me joyful, the third thing of what's already happening, which would and does make me joyful, is to see young people getting involved in worrying about trying to do something about the climate,
8786000	8806000	people like Greta Thunberg, people worrying, young people coming together to campaign against child poverty or, you know, these things, getting young people involved, not getting, seeing young people involved in that does make me feel good.
8806000	8828000	If it's something that's not happening at the moment, and therefore, you know, I would like to see it happen and would make it joyful, would make me joyful in the future, I suppose the main one would be if there could be, not unrelated to the first one,
8828000	8849000	there could be or would be, might be some sort of agreement, which would have to be an international agreement, as things stand, to actually really do something, not talk about doing it, not as Greta Thunberg puts it, blah, blah, blah,
8849000	8869000	but would really do something about global warming, biodiversity loss, and so on, because it is, I mean, I wouldn't use this term, but you can see it's heartbreaking to see what's happening to biodiversity and the loss of natural species and so on and so forth.
8869000	8875000	So I suppose it'd be those two different angles on it, what I would think about.
8875000	8883000	Perfect. Thank you so much, Pat. This was absolutely great. Thank you so much for your time.
8883000	8885000	I've enjoyed it. Thank you for setting it up.
