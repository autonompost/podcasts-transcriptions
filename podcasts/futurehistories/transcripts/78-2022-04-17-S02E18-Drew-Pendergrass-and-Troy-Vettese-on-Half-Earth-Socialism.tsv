480	1840	Welcome to Future Histories.
1840	3400	My name is Jan Groos,
3400	5800	and it is my great pleasure to welcome
5800	9620	Troy Witteze and Drew Pendergrass in today's episode.
9620	12840	They are the authors of the newly released book,
12840	15080	Half-Earth Socialism.
15080	19440	And since Troy and Drew do see democratic economic planning
19440	21920	as an integral part of what they propose
21920	25760	as Half-Earth Socialism, I was intrigued to read it.
25760	28740	And it has been an interesting read for me, I have to say,
28740	32180	because there are quite some elements in it
32180	35360	that I kind of stumbled over, I would say.
35360	38620	And this is, of course, always great for a good interview
38620	40440	and an interesting discussion.
40440	43620	We didn't really touch the veganism aspect
43620	45020	of their proposal in detail.
45020	48060	I'll leave that to others to discuss.
48060	52020	But we did go into planning, of course, in quite some detail.
52020	55760	And I think it made an interesting exchange.
55800	58920	I certainly enjoyed talking to Troy and to Drew,
58920	61840	and I hope you will enjoy listening to it.
61840	65240	Before we start, I would like to thank David, Fabian,
65240	67960	Lucas, and Wilfried for their donations.
67960	70760	And I would like to welcome Bj√∂rn, Manuel, and Gereon
70760	72640	as patrons of Future Histories.
72640	74320	Thank you so much.
74320	76120	If you want to support Future Histories,
76120	79720	but you do not have the monetary resources to do so,
79720	82080	then first of all, thank you too.
82080	83420	It's highly appreciated.
83420	86900	And then there is an absolutely brilliant way
86900	89860	to support the project in non-monetary form
89860	93060	by transcribing your favorite episode.
93060	95980	There's a collaborative transcription project
95980	98060	that has formed around Future Histories,
98060	102060	and I want to thank everybody who has already contributed.
102060	104160	So if there's an episode you like,
104160	107520	and you see a value in providing a transcript of the episode,
107520	111760	and I would argue there are many benefits from a transcript,
111780	114700	then please find a link and a contact email
114700	115980	in the show notes.
115980	118800	So go for it, and thank you.
118800	120920	But now please enjoy today's episode
120920	123360	with Drew Pendergrass and Troy Wieteser
123360	126160	on Half-Earth Socialism.
126160	129320	["Half-Earth Socialism"]
131440	132280	Welcome, Troy.
132280	133840	Welcome, Drew.
133840	135560	Thanks for having us.
135560	137000	It's a pleasure.
137000	138520	Let's start with the definition.
138520	141280	What is Half-Earth Socialism?
141280	145560	Half-Earth Socialism is a kind of socialism
145560	149320	based on the recognition of ecological limits,
149320	151640	but also the limits to our understanding
151640	153520	of the natural world.
153520	158520	And therefore, we're saying that the environmental crisis
159340	161700	can only become overcome by socialism
161700	164840	because it is only socialism that humans can decide
164840	166960	to manage economic growth,
166960	169640	which is impossible under capitalism.
169640	173640	And then we're also saying that socialists
173640	175880	have to be environmentalists
175880	178480	because they have to realize
178480	180800	that total control over nature is impossible
180800	182400	because the more we intervene in nature,
182400	183600	the more risks we take,
183600	185600	such as pandemics or climate change.
185600	189240	So Half-Earth Socialism is that in a nutshell,
189240	191960	and it's also arguing for noiratian,
191960	194360	no conscious control of the economy.
194360	198580	And we propose rewilding half the planet,
198580	200260	which is the Half-Earth component,
200260	205100	and having energy quotas and veganism
205100	208620	to reduce our impact on nature
208620	211140	while also ensuring a good life for all.
212100	213420	I actually know if I have anything to add.
213420	215820	Troy, you did a very good definition.
215820	216660	Thanks.
217540	220900	And before you set out to describe your ideas
220900	223800	about how to address climate catastrophe in the book,
223800	226020	you dissect some other approaches,
226020	227660	three approaches actually,
227660	229420	that are brought forward by others.
229420	233860	And those are bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration,
233860	237140	it's short B-E-C-C-S, nuclear power,
237140	240640	and the idea of Half-Earth itself, actually,
240640	243860	because the origins of this idea of Half-Earth
243860	245700	are not quite innocent.
245700	249580	And there are strands tied to this concept
249580	254540	that have, I think, some quite Malthusian ring to it,
254540	258940	as well as some nativist tendencies, if I'm not mistaken.
258940	262620	So these are three approaches that you dissect
262620	266160	before you lay out your own proposal within the book.
266160	270220	Maybe let's take a look at these three approaches,
270220	273600	and maybe you can tell us what the shortcomings
273600	277180	of these quote unquote solutions are.
277180	281500	Yeah, so you're describing here our kind of look at
282500	284780	the sort of half solutions on offer
284780	289700	by sort of mainstream environmental slash modeling.
289700	291260	So we can take them in turn.
291260	293460	So the first option, BEX,
293460	298340	is an interesting kind of modeling artifact.
298340	299780	So the idea with bioengineering
299780	301500	with carbon capture and storage, or BEX,
301500	305260	is that you have plantations of probably trees,
305260	307100	and then you cut these down,
307100	309740	you burn it for energy, for electricity,
309740	312280	you capture the carbon emitted from the trees,
312280	314220	and then you bury that carbon underground.
314220	316900	And the idea is that this is a carbon negative energy source
316900	319820	because the carbon released by the trees,
319820	321620	the trees capture carbon, they grow,
321620	324660	capture that carbon, you put it underground.
324660	326900	And this is, believe it or not,
326900	330220	integral to pretty much all of the intergovernmental panel
330220	334780	on climate change, IPCC's 1.5 degree models.
334780	337740	So limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees,
337740	340500	and even a lot of the two degree models,
340500	342660	the idea is that they're trying to model
342660	344260	how you might do this energy transition.
344260	347020	It's very hard to do a massive transition very quickly.
347020	348940	So a lot of the models have overshoot
348940	350940	or emit too much or something,
350940	352620	and you need to have negative emissions
352620	354420	to push you back down.
354420	357020	They're often very large amounts of negative emissions.
357020	358700	So the models produce,
358700	360220	these are models that are running blindly.
360220	361820	They're just neoclassical models
361820	363460	with a climate model attached.
363460	364500	And they kind of blindly are like,
364580	366580	okay, let's take three India's worth of land,
366580	368980	plant some tree plantations, burn it.
368980	370140	Let's make some nice assumptions
370140	371540	that this is a carbon negative,
371540	373660	like that there's not an unintended consequence
373660	378660	by like say, soils control a lot of the biosphere's carbon.
378980	380980	Maybe by doing this, we might mess up the soils
380980	383500	and the soils might start emitting carbon,
383500	384700	bracket all that.
384700	387260	And then if you do this, okay, you have a nice solution.
387260	389100	You can have your energy transition
389100	390820	with a lot of fruit to spare.
390820	393860	And the bottom line is this is sort of
393900	396060	obviously never going to happen.
396060	401060	It's a massive project with no movement behind it.
401820	406020	It's just, it's a modeling artifact.
406020	408540	And if anything, it's harder to do the energy transition
408540	409820	than these models make it sound
409820	413580	because BEX is so integral to many of these models.
413580	415180	Now there are models that don't involve BEX
415180	417700	and they involve a much more rapid energy transition.
417700	420580	And that's more aligned with what we are talking about,
420580	423980	things like large amounts of energy use reductions.
425580	429140	The second proposal that we talk about is nuclear power.
429140	432460	And we're more specifically talking to a specific strain
432460	434740	of environmentalists who wants to build
434740	437180	like a nuclear power plant a week or something like this,
437180	438380	or maybe even more.
439220	440980	There's two nuclear power plants a week,
440980	441860	Troy is telling me.
441860	443540	Yeah, so the idea is,
443540	447020	we build up this massive electricity capacity
447020	450380	and then together with a big electrification project,
451220	452060	you solve the climate crisis
452060	455220	by putting everything on this big nuclear power grid.
455220	459860	But this is also seems a little bit ridiculous.
460780	462700	For one thing, nuclear power plants are very hard
462700	466420	and expensive to build and very complex machines.
466420	467780	And we said in the book that
468780	472020	even if nuclear power plants are safer now,
472020	473700	there's still a pretty high risk
473700	476540	of something like a Fukushima like disaster,
476540	479180	even with our current number of nuclear power plants.
480060	482980	So if you add a bunch more, that risk goes up.
482980	485980	We still haven't solved the nuclear waste problem.
485980	488220	The fact that nuclear power is connected
488220	490500	to nuclear weapons in an intimate way
490500	494420	is also another existential threat to worry about.
494420	495500	And then also the fact that
495500	497580	if you build this many power plants,
497580	499420	you are manning a lot of uranium.
499420	501660	Uranium is a pretty nasty thing to mine.
501660	503300	It gets impure pretty quickly
503300	506060	once you mine out of the good, I guess,
506060	508300	the high quality ores.
508300	511660	And then you end up with some problems
511660	513900	and propose solutions to do different kinds of reactors
513900	515620	like fast speed reactors have problems
515620	517260	because they use sodium as a coolant
517260	520420	and sodium explodes when exposed to air.
520420	523620	And that's just, so we just don't think
523620	526820	that this is a plausible plan.
526820	529380	And then the final one we talk about is the half earth.
529380	531660	And many on the left are familiar
531660	536060	with the difficulties of the conservation movement,
536300	538340	the quite nasty side of it.
538340	540980	And we don't hold any punches here.
540980	544140	So the half earth idea comes out
544140	546060	of an intellectual tradition
546060	548940	that has pretty nasty relationship
548940	552260	with indigenous peoples and this sort of thing.
552260	554900	And E.O. Wilson, who ends up taking it on
554900	558020	and popularizing it in a 2014 book,
558020	561940	he is better than some of these conservationists,
561940	562900	but that's not saying much
562900	567060	because he is quite notorious for his sociobiology
567060	572060	is sort of determinism on the basis of genes
572460	573300	and that sort of thing.
573300	576820	So pretty antithetical to what we believe on the left.
576820	580100	But while interrogating this tradition,
580100	583420	what we think is important is that mass extinction,
583420	586020	the ongoing sixth mass extinction in earth's history
586020	589540	is something that we on the left need to care about.
589540	592220	So the sixth mass extinction is going on now
592220	594020	driven by human activity.
594020	596700	There have been five previous mass extinctions.
596700	598940	They are disastrous for life on earth,
598940	601740	not just because we should care about other species
601740	603980	on this planet, but in terms of...
603980	606700	In science, we call it ecosystem services.
606700	611060	So nature does things for us, like keep the water clean,
612180	617180	pollinate our crops, make sure that disease is kept at bay,
618180	621860	all sorts of vital functions.
621860	626060	And if this ecosystem functioning and also carbon capture,
626060	628500	like half of the carbon we've emitted has been captured
628500	630700	by either the oceans or the land.
630700	631900	Some of that's inorganic,
631900	635140	but a good bit of it is through life on earth.
635140	638060	So these are just parts of the planet
638060	639700	that we can't afford to lose.
639700	643180	And the thing that drives mass extinction,
643180	646060	perhaps the most is habitat loss.
646820	649300	So we need to take seriously the idea
649300	652020	that habitat loss is a problem.
652020	654060	It's driving a major environmental crisis.
654060	656060	It's a crisis that will affect all of us
656060	658860	that affects our prospects of having a good life.
658860	660660	And it affects other species on this planet
660660	662100	that we should care about too.
663100	668020	So basically we shouldn't throw the baby out
668020	671460	with the bath water, but we shouldn't like maybe
671460	673220	not interrogate the bath water, I guess,
673220	676020	to use this metaphor badly.
676940	678620	So we talk about how biodiversity is higher
678620	682820	in indigenous managed lands than nature preserves
682820	683980	in many cases.
683980	687180	So there's no need to inherit these nasty sides
687180	690260	of conservation, but we still need to take seriously
690260	692100	the need to protect nature.
693420	696020	Okay, that's interesting because now you kind
696020	701020	of implicitly already answered a question I had regarding
701700	704300	why you stick to this concept of half earth,
704300	709300	because to me it felt as if maybe because of this history
709780	713220	that this concept has and the line of thinking
713220	716980	that underlies it, which has a, in some parts,
716980	721500	slightly semi-authoritarian touch, I'd say.
723340	727340	It begs the question how to avoid including
727340	730180	these highly problematic aspects of the concept
730180	733060	of half earth, because it's not just the ignorance
733060	737900	towards indigenous knowledges and different other problems
737900	742900	that this conservative conservationist movement has,
743100	746100	but also, at least to me, when reading the book,
746940	751180	you will always come into a position where if you start
751180	756180	by having a very concrete idea of how things should be
756660	760580	in the beginning, you will come into the position
760580	765300	where you will kind of have to construct a system
765300	768700	that necessarily, quote unquote, forces people
768700	773700	into what you believe is the correct answer to the problem.
774420	777860	And so there's a specific line of argument,
777860	782620	a line of reasoning underlying this whole idea
782620	785820	that kind of brings you in the territory
785820	789020	where you will have to confront the question
789020	794020	of, in this case, also central authoritarian tendencies.
797620	800500	But I don't think we're naive liberals here
800500	802980	where we think that, oh, it's just a matter
802980	805860	of individual choice that's gonna solve any of these problems.
805860	807660	I mean, we don't use, we don't think this way
807660	808980	when it comes to fossil fuels.
808980	811380	I think socialists are comfortable enough saying
811380	814860	we have to get rid of fossil fuels quickly,
814860	817260	and that's going to require how we live,
817300	818980	and it's gonna force how a lot of people
818980	822180	who use a lot of fossil fuels to change how they live.
822180	824060	And that's, we're also quite comfortable saying
824060	826940	we want equality, that means no more rich people.
826940	829180	I mean, we're happy saying all these things,
829180	832460	but when it comes to meat or the animal question in general,
832460	835700	then people say, oh, hey, you can't say that.
835700	839300	And I think on the left, we need to have a real discussion
839300	844300	about what is a socialist ethic towards animals
845020	849900	and what is the relationship we want with animals.
849900	851660	And this book tries to push that forward.
851660	855180	But we make clear in the book that our approach
855180	857180	or what we're arguing in the book
857180	858700	is really two separate things.
858700	863700	One is a way to think about what socialism is and practice.
864620	866300	And this is where we draw Noirat.
866300	868780	He's saying it's important to have this utopian tradition
868780	871260	where people come up with total plans
871260	872860	or what he calls like social engineering,
872900	876780	and then people compare these utopian future plans
876780	879740	and then vote on them and they decide upon them.
879740	882020	And versus, and the second part would be
882020	884060	what we think those future plans should be.
884060	885780	We offer our own future plan.
885780	887500	But we say quite clearly,
887500	889420	also because at some level we have no power,
889420	890820	we can't force anyone to do anything.
890820	895820	But we say, if you don't agree with us, that's fine.
896540	898860	But then we have to make trade-off somewhere.
898860	901180	We have to say, okay, we're happy to have
901180	904860	synodic disease and mass extinction, and that's okay.
904860	907700	Or we have to live with more nuclear power plants.
907700	910900	And it's, you know, maybe as we can't produce enough energy
910900	914060	for easily high energy quotas or whatever it is,
914060	916220	but we need to have this discussion
916220	918380	about what kind of life we want.
918380	923020	And to kind of keep the veil over this future society
923020	925780	is not proven to be a successful strategy.
925780	928500	And I think it also is missing the key insight of Noirat,
928500	931300	which is socialism is this collective decision
931300	934260	over our future, and to keep it obscure
934260	936460	is actually quite a neoliberal move.
936460	939420	Like only the market can know something as complex as this.
939420	941620	So again, the book is doing two things,
941620	945740	and we like to think we make a good case
945740	947980	for vegan rewilding,
947980	950580	but we want to have more debates
950580	952500	about what this future should be.
953980	956460	Yeah, democracy is a very big theme in the book,
957300	958860	and it's a major part of,
958860	961500	in the portion of the book that's dealing with planning,
961500	963980	because we kind of take that,
963980	965340	the magnitude of changes required
965340	966820	to do the energy transition alone,
966820	969980	let alone address other parts of the climate crisis
969980	973100	is simply a massive task for planning.
973100	974500	And the question is, how can you plan
974500	977900	in a way that is democratic
977900	979700	and doesn't concentrate power in the hands
979700	983500	of maybe a small bureaucracy or some bureaucracy
983500	988180	that's unaccountable to the rest of humanity?
988180	989740	So we take this problem very seriously,
989740	990580	and I was sort of saying,
990580	993540	we have this idea of these total plans
993540	996340	where you might have a plan that involves
996340	997580	higher use of fossil fuels
997580	999780	with solar geoengineering to cool the climate,
999780	1002100	and that would come with huge amounts of risks
1002100	1003980	and maybe many disasters caused,
1003980	1006500	but perhaps that would be the one that wins out
1006500	1008260	in our imagined parliament,
1008260	1011420	and the intro would just be unhappy in the opposition,
1011420	1014860	but that's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.
1014860	1017980	But the hope would be that we make a clear choice
1017980	1018900	about what's going on,
1018900	1022300	because right now we're fumbling blindly into the future.
1022300	1026020	People aren't aware of the trade-offs of decisions,
1026020	1030180	like having a massive animal industry
1030180	1032700	causes huge amounts of land to be used
1032700	1034700	in a very inefficient way,
1035900	1038820	burning down the Amazon to make new pastures for cattle.
1039820	1042900	It's not exactly a great planning choice,
1042900	1047900	and I think these things are talked about blindly
1048500	1051740	in an isolation, but when they're combined together
1051740	1053820	and the trade-offs are more apparent,
1053820	1055860	that's sort of when democracy can really begin
1055860	1059340	and when kind of a more sensible,
1059340	1062980	I don't know, control of the planet can start.
1062980	1065100	Before we get to the planning part,
1065100	1067020	and this will be, of course,
1067060	1069940	a big part of our conversation today,
1069940	1071420	before we get to the planning part,
1071420	1074340	maybe you could say some words about your position
1074340	1078940	towards epistemic groundings of this proposal
1078940	1080940	in terms of planning,
1080940	1084060	because I think what is very much relevant
1084060	1087540	for the whole concept that you propose
1087540	1090500	and relevant for also a lot of the questions I had
1090500	1092660	after reading the book is,
1092660	1096340	what information do you think we need,
1096380	1099180	and how much can we actually know?
1099180	1100620	Because in the book,
1100620	1104700	you make use of certain types of modeling.
1104700	1109460	You propose that we can use modern modeling technology
1109460	1111220	in terms of climate modeling.
1111220	1115340	We could repurpose it for questions of planning,
1115340	1118340	and also when it comes to the question
1118340	1121220	whether or not a maybe more decentralized version
1121220	1124620	of planning would be interesting or a central one,
1124620	1128020	again, the question of epistemic assumptions
1128020	1131980	about what knowledge can somebody have
1131980	1134380	and where can it be located comes up.
1134380	1137980	So I would be interested in what was the epistemic grounding
1137980	1142180	when you were thinking about how this planning procedure
1142180	1144020	could be sketched out.
1144020	1146460	So one of the foundations for the book
1146460	1150500	from the very beginning is this dialogue
1150500	1154140	with the neoliberals, with Hayek and von Mises.
1154140	1157420	And what the neoliberals use,
1157420	1159220	and Troy, you can jump in a little bit
1159220	1162380	and talk more about your favorite baddies,
1162380	1166260	but what the neoliberals say is basically
1166260	1169740	that markets are information collecting machines.
1169740	1172380	They're machines for information
1172380	1177100	where the price acts as a decentralized signal
1177100	1180420	that allows everyone to respond in concert to changes,
1180420	1181860	and they don't need to necessarily know
1181860	1182780	why the price is that,
1182780	1185380	but it allows them to make according plans.
1187140	1190940	And a big part of the idea here
1190940	1194460	is that human intervention in the market
1194460	1196020	will always be misguided
1196020	1199420	because the market is sort of beyond human.
1199420	1203380	It's a machine that is too complex
1203380	1205300	and important to mess with,
1205300	1207380	and therefore we should leave it alone
1207380	1209660	and let it go about its information business.
1209660	1211900	And we should add markets in as many places as we can,
1211900	1214780	even where there aren't markets already.
1214780	1216780	So it's an epistemic argument.
1216780	1219420	It's an argument that we can't know about the market.
1220580	1223260	And interestingly, they use a lot of natural metaphors,
1223260	1226820	biological metaphors to back up this claim.
1226820	1229220	So they use biology as a metaphor for the economy
1230300	1233380	rather than the neoclassical metaphor of physics
1233380	1236700	to understand making equations, right, to model the economy.
1236700	1239180	What we point out is that the obvious point
1239180	1241100	that if you're using nature as a metaphor
1241100	1243620	for how complex the economy is,
1243620	1246500	well, surely nature is more complicated than that.
1246500	1248460	And we talk a lot about how complex nature is
1248460	1252100	and how it evades attempts of management,
1252100	1253940	many attempts of management.
1253940	1255420	We talk about the ozone hole, right,
1255420	1257740	where the chlorofluorocarbons were used
1257740	1260020	to replace dangerous refrigerants.
1260020	1262340	And these were supposed to be completely non-reactive,
1262340	1264460	like all chemistry up to that point,
1264460	1266340	we're like, yeah, you know, these are tightly bound.
1266340	1268940	Nothing's gonna break these molecules apart.
1268940	1270620	It turns out that in this stratosphere
1270620	1273100	under certain conditions over Antarctica
1273100	1275460	and to some extent over the Arctic in the winter
1275460	1276660	and in the spring, you know,
1276660	1278540	you can get this breaking apart
1278540	1281700	and then you can get chlorine radical cycles
1281700	1284180	just completely eviscerate the ozone layer.
1284180	1285500	And we just got lucky with this.
1285500	1286740	We got lucky that it only destroyed
1286740	1287980	the ozone layer of Antarctica.
1287980	1289660	If the rate constants were different,
1289660	1291660	then maybe it would go all over.
1291660	1294820	So it was just lucky.
1294820	1295780	This was an intervention
1295780	1299420	that had all the kind of basis behind it,
1299420	1300940	all the kind of research behind it.
1300940	1302620	And so it's just kind of a lesson
1302620	1307020	that interventions into the environment are risky.
1307020	1309020	They, it's a very complex place.
1309020	1310780	We also use the metaphor biosphere two,
1310780	1311820	which was an attempt to make
1311820	1314020	an artificial closed ecosystem
1314020	1315740	with like an artificial coral reef,
1315740	1316900	a bunch of different biomes,
1316900	1318140	like in a little dome
1318140	1320380	and have some humans inside and be supported.
1320380	1322700	And it completely collapsed rather quickly
1322700	1325540	because of unintended consequences
1325540	1328460	like the concrete reacted with the oxygen
1329260	1331340	and they needed to pump in more oxygen
1331340	1333020	so people wouldn't die.
1333020	1334020	Most of the species died
1334020	1336340	but the invasive cockroaches thrived.
1336340	1337900	It was a disaster.
1337900	1341700	And it's a lesson in how complex ecosystem services are.
1342620	1346020	So we point out that basically the question comes down to,
1346020	1348380	are you going to plan nature?
1348380	1350900	Basically, are you going to use geoengineering?
1350900	1353900	Are you gonna, for example, spray sulfur
1353900	1356940	into the stratosphere to cool the planet
1356980	1358620	and make the world safe for markets
1358620	1360980	to continue to go about their business?
1360980	1363300	Or are you going to step in
1363300	1366620	and say that humans must plan our own activities,
1366620	1371620	the economy and not attempt to plan nature
1371860	1376780	more than a certain amount described maybe by a vote.
1376780	1380020	We obviously have to intervene in nature to like grow food
1380020	1383380	and to supply ourselves with the resources we need.
1383380	1385620	But we argue that we should set
1385620	1387300	some conscious limits there
1387300	1390820	so that we allow nature to have its continued functioning.
1391820	1394100	I definitely agree with what Drew said
1394100	1398020	and Drew can speak more about the technical aspects
1398020	1401460	of how do you relate a global plan
1401460	1405340	to a series of regional and local plans?
1405340	1408620	How do you use linear programming
1408620	1410700	to plan the future as well,
1410700	1413820	which is one thing Kantorovich worked on.
1413860	1416740	But what I'm gonna say is relating more
1416740	1421300	to this neoliberal question of what can be known.
1421300	1424260	And we can be engaged quite a bit with neoliberals
1424260	1427620	because we think they really raise an interesting point,
1427620	1432620	which is economics is where is a question of knowledge.
1433740	1437300	And we think socialists haven't dealt very well with this
1437300	1439220	or at some level, a lot of the market socialists
1439220	1442380	just say Mises was right and Noyrat was wrong.
1442620	1445500	And therefore, you need markets under socialism.
1445500	1449020	And we still think Noyrat's critique
1449020	1452140	of pseudo rationality holds true
1452140	1455340	where if you have markets based on some kind
1455340	1459060	of universal metric, this labor time, chits,
1459060	1462420	or is it energy or what have you,
1462420	1464420	it would eventually lead to irrational outcomes.
1464420	1467060	And the only way to rationally manage ourselves
1467060	1469100	as a species is to recognize
1469100	1472140	that they're incommensurate units.
1472900	1474740	And we have to judge the totality,
1474740	1477740	which is again, what Noyrat argues.
1477740	1479900	And we're not saying this is gonna be easy.
1479900	1483380	We're not saying that it's gonna work perfectly.
1483380	1486260	I mean, we get into Cornyn and this idea
1486260	1489940	that socialism leads towards shortage often.
1489940	1494180	And at some level, we're saying we have to make a choice
1495940	1498660	between do we want restraint and shortage
1498740	1502900	or do we want excess and disaster
1502900	1505540	and excesses that we don't want as well.
1505540	1508580	The other thing I would say is that I think it's true
1508580	1513580	at some level what socialists and neoliberals point out.
1514620	1516020	I mean, I think at some level it's true
1516020	1520940	that it's hard to make up for or compensate
1520940	1523900	for or replace tacit knowledge
1523900	1526580	as the person on the ground will have a better view
1526580	1528580	of things than the planner far away.
1529500	1531900	That is true, but there is also a value
1531900	1535260	to having an attempt to see the whole.
1535260	1537420	And the problems that we're facing now,
1537420	1539700	I think are better faced with the latter,
1539700	1541340	with attempts to grasp the whole
1541340	1544540	than with attempts from a point of view of a single person.
1544540	1548140	And that's the wager we're making.
1548140	1549700	That's very interesting.
1549700	1551380	And we will come back to this
1551380	1554220	because I have some follow-up questions
1554220	1555900	regarding exactly that.
1555900	1558180	But before we do so, I think it would be important
1558180	1562340	for listeners, for the audience to maybe take a step back
1562340	1567180	and like cautiously get into the planning stuff
1567180	1570340	because you argue actually for a synthesis
1570340	1572140	of different approaches, including,
1572140	1574700	as you already mentioned, in Natura calculation
1574700	1576780	as proposed by Otto Neurath.
1576780	1580740	But you also include Kantorowicz's linear programming,
1580740	1581940	cybernetics in the form
1581940	1584940	of Stafford Beer's viable systems model.
1584940	1587380	What elements from these different approaches
1587380	1590020	do you think should be incorporated
1590020	1593740	in contemporary eco-socialist planning?
1593740	1597860	And how does the resulting planning mechanism
1597860	1599900	actually look like?
1599900	1603820	Yeah, so to do a high-level overview,
1603820	1606540	the basic idea is to have,
1606540	1608100	we kind of imagined sort of roughly
1608100	1611620	that you would have some set of total plans,
1611620	1614340	so visions that are coherent for the future
1614380	1617660	that are then made available for a vote
1617660	1621020	and then are produced in turn also with lots of input
1621020	1625060	from people and various interests.
1625060	1627420	And so how you would devise these sort of,
1627420	1629820	you would call them maybe blueprints for the future.
1629820	1632180	And you might use many different methodologies
1632180	1633780	to produce such a blueprint.
1634780	1636500	One important historical algorithm
1636500	1639540	that is still very important today is linear programming,
1639540	1642060	which is a way of doing constrained optimization.
1642060	1645100	So if you have a set of constraints that you propose,
1645100	1648780	like we have only this many people working this many hours
1648780	1650220	and we need to produce these goods,
1650220	1651820	what's an optimal solution
1651820	1653460	or an optimal way of distributing this work?
1653460	1655820	And this is used all the time in corporate planning.
1655820	1656780	This is used all the time
1656780	1659100	in designing renewable energy systems.
1659100	1660820	It's a very commonly used algorithm,
1660820	1662500	but there are of course many other ways,
1662500	1664340	many other tools that one can use.
1664340	1666180	The idea is to make like kind of a rough draft,
1666180	1668500	no need to go into super deep detail
1668500	1669860	and it's not even probably possible,
1669860	1671940	but to give people an idea of like, okay,
1672820	1674300	if we have a high energy use future,
1674300	1676580	this is the sort of resources we'll need.
1676580	1678780	This is the amount of maybe mining labor,
1678780	1681660	this is the amount of XYZ
1681660	1684220	and these are the natural risks,
1684220	1686140	the risks of climate change,
1686140	1688140	the risks of geoengineering,
1688140	1691220	the risks of XYZ involved in this plan.
1691220	1692300	And then you might have another plan
1692300	1694340	that's more in line with what me and Troy are proposing.
1694340	1697380	So you give up a meat
1697380	1700780	and maybe there could be variations of how much meat
1700780	1702500	and animal products are given up.
1704100	1705900	And then you can talk about the benefits
1705900	1708340	and the sacrifices involved.
1708340	1710460	And then hopefully you come to a vote
1710460	1713420	and you come up with a particular path forward.
1713420	1714340	And then from there,
1714340	1716460	you have to go to day-to-day management.
1716460	1719300	And this is where we draw on more of the Stafford beer.
1719300	1720700	Yes, Troy.
1720700	1721940	I just wanted to point out
1721940	1724980	that Drew has already made a model,
1724980	1727060	a very basic linear programming model
1727060	1729140	with these constraints between energy use
1729180	1731500	and land use and extinction rate and all that.
1731500	1733540	And we use that in the book and we say,
1733540	1736260	okay, well, what if we want this quota for energy
1736260	1738380	or what if we want to protect this much land?
1738380	1740660	And then we test the constraints
1740660	1742620	and see if that plan is viable.
1742620	1744820	And again, this is a very basic model
1744820	1745980	but it's already more complex
1745980	1749140	than Nordhaus' DICE model, right?
1749140	1752100	And this is not hard to do,
1752100	1756340	to have like a very basic discussion about what's possible.
1756380	1759460	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
1759460	1762020	Very basic model, but the idea is basically being like,
1762020	1764820	okay, if you assume a certain amount of electrification,
1764820	1767540	how much, what would your energy mix look like?
1767540	1768660	That sort of thing.
1768660	1772860	But from there, you have to go to day-to-day management.
1772860	1776900	So we talk a little bit about the Cybersyn experiment
1776900	1779860	in Salvador Allende's democratic socialist experiment
1779860	1783380	in Chile in the early 1970s.
1783380	1786820	And the idea here was that the Allende government
1786820	1790780	was bringing in industries into the state controlled sector
1790780	1794340	and they needed to basically organize and plan
1794340	1797220	this rapidly growing sector of the economy.
1797220	1800620	And so some Chilean engineers brought in Stafford Beer
1800620	1804780	who was a British cybernetics person.
1804780	1808660	And Beer had this model that he had been working on,
1808660	1811540	this kind of management model that was hoping
1812420	1813740	to your earlier point,
1813740	1816940	try and balance the appropriate amount of centralization
1816940	1820900	to make sure that resources are being allocated sensibly
1820900	1822820	with enough decentralization
1822820	1825260	to prevent any irrational outcomes
1825260	1828460	or violations of the democratic socialist principles
1828460	1831860	that Allende's revolution was built on top of.
1831860	1835340	So both kind of making use of sort of tacit knowledge
1835340	1837420	of closer to a particular circumstance
1837420	1841620	and also preventing any unjust
1841620	1844060	or undenocratic bureaucracy from emerging.
1845700	1847380	And it's a lot of detail to get into,
1847380	1850340	but the basic idea of the viable systems model is there's,
1850340	1853620	you can kind of let say a factory manage itself
1853620	1858460	most of the time, kind of letting higher authorities know
1858460	1860060	its inputs and outputs.
1860060	1862500	Although Stafford Beer would hate me saying higher authority.
1862500	1864380	He considered this whole thing level,
1865380	1870380	but like letting a more central information managers
1870380	1871700	knowing inputs and outputs,
1871700	1874100	and then emergent skills could be bumped up
1874100	1876980	to higher levels of coordination.
1876980	1879020	And again, Stafford Beer would hate me saying higher,
1879020	1884020	but this proves its metal in a CIA backed strike
1884340	1887940	against the logistic sector, against the trucking sector.
1887940	1892940	So basically the entire transport of materials breaks down
1892940	1896700	in Chile and they had some loyal trucks left.
1896700	1899140	And the question was, how can we make sure everyone gets food
1899140	1901020	and how can we make sure that the economy
1901020	1902380	continues to function?
1902380	1906220	And this sort of system allowed basically people
1906220	1908940	on the ground to kind of almost in dialogue
1908940	1912460	with the center, direct resources in the most wise way.
1912460	1915020	So like mapping out where this truck should be driving.
1915020	1919740	So it was this very remarkable evenness
1919740	1923220	between kind of people out in the field
1923220	1926620	and people in the center where all this information
1926620	1928540	was kind of coming in and being distributed,
1928540	1932660	where these scarce resources are being allocated reasonably
1932660	1933940	and the country was able to make it
1933940	1937060	through the strike successfully.
1937060	1940660	So it's a really interesting kind of management experiment
1940660	1941900	that did use technology,
1941900	1945260	but not as much as I think it has a reputation for.
1945260	1947780	These were like primitive fax machines, right?
1947780	1948980	That was required.
1948980	1952580	The computer itself was important, but not hugely.
1952580	1956100	And then we bring in some more modern ways
1956100	1959300	of fusing information with modeling from climate science.
1959300	1962500	So climate science and weather are,
1962500	1964780	I think something that we should be talking about
1964780	1967380	because what the weather system is,
1967380	1969540	what the weather kind of prediction system is,
1969540	1972060	is a truly global system of information.
1972060	1975260	So we have weather models, which are models of physics,
1976220	1978340	but the weather system is chaotic.
1978340	1980260	People have heard of the butterfly effect, right?
1980260	1981380	Butterfly flaps and swings,
1981380	1983900	and then all of a sudden there's a hurricane.
1983900	1986260	And the basic idea is that if you have slight changes
1986260	1987460	in your initial conditions,
1987460	1990180	days later you have a totally different weather system.
1990180	1991740	It's a chaotic system.
1991740	1993340	So you need your initial conditions
1993340	1995180	to be as close to accurate as you can
1995180	1996980	so that your forecast is accurate.
1996980	1998700	And the reason why weather forecasts have improved
1998700	2000460	is because we have better initial conditions.
2000460	2001620	We have better initial conditions
2001620	2004820	because we have a global network of sensors, monitors,
2004980	2005900	and information.
2005900	2008060	We have satellites, we have buoys in the ocean,
2008060	2010580	we have ships, we have aircraft,
2010580	2013540	we have monitors on the surface.
2013540	2016180	In fact, during the COVID pandemic,
2016180	2017620	weather forecast got slightly worse
2017620	2019180	because you didn't have as many planes flying
2019180	2021260	and you didn't have that kind of mid-atmosphere input
2021260	2022700	into your weather model.
2022700	2024900	It's a truly global information system.
2026260	2028340	And the algorithms designed to run this system
2028340	2030020	views the sort of model of like
2030020	2032180	what you think should be going on with what's in the world.
2032180	2033900	And if there's divergence between what the model says
2033900	2034740	and what the world says,
2034740	2036940	there are optimal ways to combine those.
2036940	2039620	So if you have a plan for how the economy should work,
2039620	2042420	that plan will obviously fail because, you know,
2042420	2044940	things will not work out the way you assumed,
2044940	2046900	but it should be relatively accurate
2046900	2048900	because it is what the plan is.
2048900	2052140	And so you can update that plan on the basis of, say,
2052140	2055420	like a factory not receiving its steel shipments,
2055420	2057780	and you could maybe go in and see where the problem is
2057780	2060300	and be able to intervene in a way that's sensible,
2060300	2062780	but that also makes sure that autonomy is preserved
2062780	2065340	to as great of an extent as necessary,
2065340	2067660	but also make sure that everyone's working towards
2067660	2070220	common, coherent goals.
2070220	2072460	So it's a balancing approach.
2072460	2074060	And these are really remarkable algorithms.
2074060	2076540	I think there needs to be more conversation about them.
2076540	2078980	They're very powerful tools that are already being used
2078980	2082660	to do a form of global information management.
2083660	2085420	And I'm very sorry, Drew,
2085420	2088780	but I have to pick up on the question of higher authority
2089660	2091260	because you rightly point out
2091260	2094340	that I would be skeptical of this phrase,
2094340	2098980	but when I read specifically the narrative part
2098980	2100580	at the end of the book,
2100580	2105580	there is a sense of quote unquote higher authority
2105980	2110980	in terms of the like central planning board.
2110980	2114180	And as far as I understood it, at the end,
2114180	2119180	the model that you propose will end up in kind of calculating
2120100	2123500	optimal plan or the best variety of plans
2123500	2126780	that all try to be as efficient as possible
2126780	2131780	and then propose these plans to the public to decide over,
2132180	2134700	but then you will always come into the situation
2134700	2137860	where people will have to enact this plan.
2137860	2140380	And this might lead to a situation
2140380	2142940	where those people who will have to enact the plan
2142940	2146020	will perceive this plan as external from themselves,
2146020	2147980	depending on how much they were involved
2147980	2149900	in creating the plan, of course,
2149900	2152380	but still, at least for me,
2152380	2155700	when reading the narrative part at the end of the book,
2155700	2158740	there was a certain sense of this
2158740	2162140	like detached planning commission,
2162140	2165860	which seemed to be a bunch of experts, quote unquote,
2165860	2168340	that calculates this optimal plan
2168340	2173340	that we are now forced to bring into being into practice.
2173980	2178980	So there is this element of higher authority coupled to,
2180420	2184300	I would say the concept of central planning per se.
2184300	2185460	And I would be interested
2185460	2189380	how you conceptualize this in your model.
2189380	2192620	I got the feeling as if your main point would be,
2192620	2196420	it's urgent, we need to fucking do something.
2196420	2198860	This is the only way we can do it.
2199380	2203460	That's the kind of vibe I got more or less,
2203460	2205180	I have to be honest.
2205180	2207300	I mean, I'll start,
2207300	2210740	Drew is definitely the more the mathematical whiz
2210740	2212020	of the two of us by far.
2212020	2214660	But I think I just want to point out that,
2217060	2219220	what's nice about linear programming
2219220	2223420	is that the math, as Drew's saying, is not so complex.
2223420	2224940	So I think we imagine at some level
2224940	2228700	that everyone would be taking linear programming
2229540	2231540	in school and anyone could make a global plan
2231540	2233780	or anyone can use the modeling tools
2233780	2236500	that one puts out to make a plan
2236500	2237740	and one could make their own plans.
2237740	2242500	And this is the very Noiratian approach to socialism
2242500	2244540	where you are showing the working class
2244540	2247420	what the economy is, let them see it through isotype,
2247420	2252020	make it as visually easy to understand
2252020	2253700	and appealing as possible.
2253700	2255140	And they'll set up museums
2255140	2257220	and get hundreds of thousands of people
2257220	2259660	to see what the Austrian economy looks like.
2259660	2261460	And then you can imagine taking it over.
2261460	2264180	And I think with this kind of mathematics,
2264180	2267940	people would see a relation between their own work
2267940	2271180	and what kind of world they want.
2271180	2273740	And I think this is an important part
2273740	2276060	of what socialist democracy would be.
2276060	2278380	And that's not to say that people are always gonna get
2278380	2280900	the plans that they vote for,
2280900	2283180	but that they want, right?
2283180	2286420	But I think it would be one important way
2286420	2290300	to overcome maybe any kind of reluctance or disagreement.
2290300	2294300	I mean, again, humans are always gonna disagree.
2294300	2296460	I don't think that's going to go away,
2296460	2300060	but there's also a reason why it's important for us
2300060	2303100	to have a more nuanced relationship
2303100	2306020	between local and central planning.
2306020	2308860	And I think a lot of debates on the left
2308860	2311020	are just like, oh, we'll just have a tiny little communes
2311020	2312820	that are extremely inefficient,
2313980	2316020	but they'll be autonomous and that'll be fine.
2316620	2318980	Or we'll have some gigantic tanky solution,
2318980	2320140	like a super plan.
2320140	2324020	And I think what Kantorovich and Bjerg get into
2324020	2325900	is a much more nimble relationship.
2325900	2329900	It's important to have some things centralized
2329900	2332900	where you can, I guess, not efficient for everyone to make,
2332900	2335820	I don't know, their own high grade aluminum
2335820	2336860	or something like that.
2336860	2339460	It's better to do in some areas than others.
2339460	2342780	But we also want to,
2342780	2344660	we also will have problems with information.
2344660	2346980	That's why you will have a central plan
2346980	2348660	that is relatively vague,
2348660	2352100	and then you get down to finer detail the lower you go.
2352100	2356340	But of course, if a planning bureau
2356340	2360020	or the parliament that we imagine that we put in La Paz
2360020	2363300	votes to have mandatory veganism or something like that,
2363300	2365900	well, I'm sure lots of people won't like that,
2365900	2368100	no matter how strong the animal rights movement
2368100	2372020	has become by 2040 or whatever it is.
2372020	2373340	I mean, there still would be opposition,
2373380	2375700	but I think that's just what politics is.
2375700	2377260	And socialism would be at some level
2377260	2379700	of the politicization of everything
2379700	2382420	because that is what democratic control of the economy is.
2382420	2383780	I don't think we should be afraid of that.
2383780	2386660	And that's where I think market socialists
2386660	2388020	escape back to the market.
2388020	2391420	I think they come close to seeing what socialism looks like,
2391420	2395340	which is what Neuert tells us in 1919,
2395340	2398300	and then they withdraw because it's too terrifying,
2398300	2399500	it's too much conflict.
2399500	2401700	But I think this is a mistake.
2403540	2408140	Yeah, I think the environmental crisis
2408140	2411860	throws a wrench into a lot of things.
2411860	2415140	And I think it's just important to remember
2415140	2419580	how challenging the questions facing us are.
2419580	2421660	Like they're more challenging,
2421660	2422780	as we talked about earlier,
2422780	2426260	than the IPCC 1.5 degree report that's on
2426260	2429460	because that report assumes so much facts.
2429460	2432500	For example, this is an extremely hard problem,
2432500	2437500	making sure that the dream of socialism that I have
2437700	2440820	is that everyone on the earth has the resources
2440820	2445820	for a good life, there's equality,
2445820	2447780	everyone has the things they need,
2447780	2450620	and we have a planet that's able to sustain this.
2451460	2453460	That's a hard goal.
2453460	2457420	And it's a goal that requires coordination.
2458420	2460740	And we do try really hard in the book to make sure,
2460740	2463220	to emphasize how if this is not democratic,
2463220	2464780	it will fail, right?
2464780	2469060	There's no way that we imagine this working,
2469060	2472380	that the democracy is not just like a value,
2472380	2473780	it's just like a functioning.
2473780	2475700	Like if you're going to basically get rid
2475700	2476820	of the capitalist engine,
2476820	2479340	which is saying that if you don't work, you'll starve.
2479340	2480980	If you're getting rid of that,
2480980	2485980	then you're going to have to have buy-in,
2486140	2488900	and democracy is how you get buy-in.
2488900	2493900	So it has to be democratic to work.
2494140	2496020	I don't know if this is convincing to you.
2496020	2496860	Yeah.
2496860	2498420	No, no, but I would say your democracy part
2498420	2501060	is also important because Kantorovich comes up
2501060	2503860	with linear programming in the 30s,
2503860	2506460	and he talks to God's plan in the 40s,
2506460	2508460	and it doesn't go anywhere because God's plan
2508460	2510420	gets all its power from,
2510420	2514020	and let alone all the ministries and the government,
2514020	2517060	get their power from powers of distribution.
2517060	2520740	And if you had people voting on a plan,
2520740	2522140	and then people carrying out the plan,
2522140	2525420	that would take away this power from these ministries
2525420	2526660	or planning bureaus.
2526660	2529620	So therefore you needed democracy
2529620	2531220	to actually have linear programming.
2531220	2534660	That's why the Soviet Union never did it at scale,
2534660	2536460	because it would undo the power
2536460	2538100	of this authoritarian regime.
2539700	2543020	Well, but the way that the plans would come about
2543020	2545540	in your proposed scheme of things
2545540	2548860	is not through mere linear programming,
2548860	2551100	as you rightly state in the book.
2551100	2556100	This is maybe a tool for certain types of questions.
2558900	2560420	It might be useful,
2560420	2565420	but it is not that people could use linear programming
2565660	2569620	at home to make a plan on their own,
2569620	2572940	because the plans that the central planning board,
2572940	2574980	quote unquote, would produce
2574980	2579220	would have so much more components included in them,
2579220	2583620	from like high level modeling
2583620	2588620	that was repurposed from climate modeling,
2589020	2592740	to like data from, I guess,
2592740	2595620	billions and billions of sensors throughout the world,
2595620	2597380	and so on and so forth.
2597380	2599540	So it is not that people could,
2599540	2602220	through this playful participation,
2602220	2607220	really take part in this planning in a meaningful way.
2607940	2610260	So my question would be,
2610260	2615260	how is this interrelationship between central and decentral
2616420	2620260	really working out in concrete terms
2620260	2622100	when it comes to A,
2622100	2624420	the question of how these plans come about,
2624420	2629420	and B, how people are rightfully so perceiving it
2630380	2635380	as a democratic act of participation within this process?
2636580	2639860	So we finished this book a year ago, right?
2639860	2642180	Maybe even a little more.
2642180	2645020	But we've kept thinking about these issues
2645020	2648980	because you're pushing on the right pressure points here.
2648980	2653420	So we've been thinking about some other literatures
2653420	2657780	and thinking about some older papers and ideas
2657780	2661260	that revolve around this idea of iterative planning
2661260	2662900	or multi-level planning.
2662900	2667900	And the idea here is that you would have some rough draft
2668420	2670660	from the middle that might say something
2670660	2673460	like some rough estimates.
2673460	2676220	Then you kind of give that out to stakeholders.
2676220	2678340	And in the original papers,
2678340	2681380	this is not overly concerned with democracy,
2681380	2683020	but we would want it to be democratic.
2683020	2683940	So you give it to stakeholders,
2683940	2685740	you'd be like, okay, to this factory,
2685740	2690020	do you think this is a reasonable like kind of downscaling
2690020	2691460	what the implications of this plan would be?
2691460	2692700	Do you think this is reasonable?
2692700	2695220	Do you need more of X or more of Y?
2695220	2697660	Is this just way too much work?
2697660	2700500	Is this too much food to expect from this piece of land
2700500	2704460	given X amount of pesticides are going to be used
2704460	2706060	or not used, that sort of thing.
2706060	2708900	And then is this going to cause harm
2708900	2712420	to this environmental region or these practices here?
2712420	2715220	And then you get the feedback and then use that to refine
2716020	2718740	and then maybe you cohere the feedback in some way.
2718740	2722820	So try and make coherent these things
2722820	2726340	and produce a new kind of rough idea of the future.
2726340	2728500	You propagate back down, get more feedback.
2728500	2730860	And hopefully after a few cycles of this,
2730860	2732540	of these sets of inputs,
2732540	2735940	you would have a set of coherent plans
2735940	2739140	that are plausible at a local level.
2739140	2741660	And then of course, when the plans are enacted,
2741660	2743100	you would have of course,
2743140	2746100	wide leeway on a local level on how to enact them.
2746100	2748300	It would be that the sort of central goals
2748300	2749300	are much more about,
2749300	2750940	are we going to cross planetary boundaries
2750940	2751900	and are we going to make sure
2751900	2753980	that everyone gets the raw amount of energy
2753980	2755980	or food that they need for a good life?
2755980	2757500	Is there going to be enough grain production?
2757500	2758940	Is there going to be enough energy production
2758940	2759780	in the right ways?
2759780	2760980	Are our grids stable?
2762740	2767660	Is the key ecosystems being managed well
2767660	2769260	by whoever's managing them?
2770620	2772260	That sort of rough idea of things.
2772260	2774460	Then when the plan is enacted,
2774460	2776260	you would have a more local manager.
2776260	2779020	So that's how we've come to imagine
2779020	2781580	from more engagement with these questions,
2781580	2783020	how you might produce these plans
2783020	2785220	in a way that has more democratic input.
2785220	2786540	And there've been some experiments
2786540	2789460	with participatory planning out there.
2789460	2794140	They're often very short-lived or partial.
2794140	2797020	I think there's a way to make it work
2797020	2801940	that's necessary both for the construction of the plan,
2802620	2805140	a fair bit of information and input,
2805140	2807340	but also in making sure that there's democratic.
2807340	2808980	There was an experiment in Kerala, India
2808980	2812540	in the 1997 to 2002 five-year plan,
2812540	2814780	which was basically an attempt to
2814780	2816860	have these participatory planning meetings
2816860	2819860	and hundreds of thousands of people got involved.
2819860	2822460	The idea was to have this input go into the plan.
2822460	2824340	The problem was that there wasn't,
2824340	2827060	this sort of iterative process didn't happen.
2827060	2829740	So you had a lot of great ideas
2829780	2834260	that didn't quite get adhered into something cool.
2834260	2835940	So there were some cool things about like pollination.
2835940	2837820	Like some people knew about how pollination worked
2837820	2840220	in their fields and they were able to get that incorporated.
2840220	2844420	But it was more like tweaks rather than like a dialogue,
2844420	2847380	which is what we would imagine being an ideal.
2847380	2849620	So this is an inspiring experiment.
2849620	2852300	But I mean, obviously you're pointing out
2852300	2853860	this is a challenging problem, right?
2853860	2857420	Like we don't feel this job, but like, yeah.
2857420	2859700	True, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,
2859700	2862060	but I think the idea is you would have these
2862060	2865940	linear programming models as a rough draft
2865940	2868980	that people could examine and vote on and all that.
2868980	2873300	And also the linear programming models would relate
2873300	2876500	from like a central, like a global plan
2876500	2878860	down to a regional and local plan in various ways.
2878860	2880140	For example, if you vote globally,
2880140	2881780	okay, everyone gets 2,000 Watts
2881780	2884380	and they have 2,500 calories.
2884380	2885660	And then like the region will say,
2885700	2888220	okay, where are we going to get this energy from?
2888220	2890700	And then make another plan and say, okay,
2890700	2893180	it's more efficient getting it from solar versus wind
2893180	2894340	and we'll put things here and there.
2894340	2897340	And then you have that kind of relationship
2897340	2901020	of being specific more and more
2901020	2902220	as you go down to the local,
2902220	2906100	but with parameters set by this larger model.
2906100	2909500	But it's not like you just vote once on a plan
2909500	2911860	and then you have the data assimilation,
2911860	2914660	the cybernetics kind of run the plan for infinity.
2914820	2918940	The way we're imagining is you would have a series of plan,
2918940	2922100	maybe like a five-year plan or whatever timeline you want.
2922100	2924500	And then people can say, go to parliament and say,
2924500	2925620	okay, what are we going to do
2925620	2927700	in the next five or 10 or 20 years?
2927700	2929860	What are our plans for that?
2929860	2931380	And that can be voted on.
2931380	2935620	So I think the linear programming is a guide
2935620	2939340	and the cybernetics is how you implement these things.
2939340	2942820	But I don't think it's once you've allowed cybernetics
2942820	2944300	to suddenly becomes undemocratic.
2944740	2946020	It's just a tool.
2946980	2950620	Well, I'm so sorry, but I have to disagree.
2950620	2951460	Please, please.
2951460	2952780	It's not just a tool.
2952780	2954300	Yeah, I'm very sorry.
2954300	2959300	Because I mean, I think at least two points within the book
2959580	2964180	where this idea of just being a tool comes up
2964180	2966940	with regard to linear programming.
2966940	2969740	And now Troy, you just mentioned it
2969740	2973780	with regard to cybernetics, but it is not just a tool.
2975180	2977140	Let's take the case of cybernetics.
2977140	2980860	It is founded on a functional equalization
2980860	2984220	of humans and machines as information processing systems.
2984220	2988420	And by looking at the situation from such a perspective,
2988420	2992180	one will find very different solutions to problems
2992180	2995300	compared to someone who looks at the problem
2995300	2998340	informed by a different paradigm, so to speak.
2998340	3003340	So these are not neutral tools or neutral theories,
3003500	3007860	but they incorporate a certain perspective on things
3007860	3012580	and that carries along certain assumptions
3012580	3016100	about the things that are addressed within the models,
3016100	3017060	so to speak.
3018100	3020660	And I mean, at least as I understood it
3020660	3023300	in the case of linear programming,
3023300	3026700	the way that you build up your idea
3026700	3031420	of synthesizing different approaches towards planning,
3031420	3034020	as far as I read it, it more or less said,
3034020	3036660	all right, we have this idea of linear programming.
3036660	3041260	We have this as a mode of approaching certain problems
3041260	3043020	where it might be adequate,
3043020	3048020	but you cannot adapt to constant changes very well.
3048460	3053460	And because of that, trying to approach planning
3054060	3057180	merely through the perspective of linear programming
3057180	3059220	is insufficient, and I would totally agree.
3059380	3062060	And because of that, you go on to take a look
3062060	3065540	at different other approaches, one of them being cybernetics.
3065540	3070220	But that does also mean that what you just tried
3070220	3074220	to describe, Troy, that we would all be kind of able
3074220	3079220	to understand or maybe even reproduce this process
3080700	3084660	would not be possible, because as I said before,
3084660	3087420	linear program is just one piece
3087460	3092260	within a very complex system of producing different plans
3092260	3095740	that will then be decided upon.
3098460	3100300	I'm not sure where this is leading me
3100300	3102540	because it's not really a question,
3102540	3107060	and I stated this before, it's just that I think for me,
3107060	3111460	it was a bit difficult to get to grips
3111460	3114620	with this directionality
3114620	3119620	and this emphasis on a center that has at the end
3121620	3126620	the knowledge that is needed in order to compute these plans,
3127220	3128820	and because there are so many problems
3128820	3132620	that go along with this, because it is also not innocent
3132620	3136980	to have five or 10 or 50 or 100 plans,
3136980	3141700	because by choosing, by pre-selecting the different plans,
3141700	3145740	you already enact such a huge power,
3145740	3149180	because you kind of present the field
3149180	3152260	upon which the further game will be played,
3152260	3155060	and this is such an immense power,
3155060	3160060	and it is not that these are merely neutral technocrats
3160300	3165300	that are just kind of doing this for the sake of humanity,
3166420	3169500	even if they do, it would be problematic
3169500	3174500	on epistemic grounds and on grounds of question of power
3174820	3176100	and stuff like that.
3176100	3180100	So I think I was kind of arguing with myself
3182660	3187660	with this type of constellation between the individuals
3188460	3192940	and the center, and then, of course, the question comes up,
3192940	3195380	how do you get people to do this?
3195380	3200380	If you have this plan, how do you get them to enact it?
3200700	3202900	So if there are no monetary incentives,
3202900	3206100	which I absolutely loved about the model,
3206100	3209340	you do not want to force people into doing anything,
3209340	3213260	and you want to give them a very high level
3213260	3214660	of existential security,
3214660	3216660	which I absolutely loved about the model,
3216660	3219780	and this is absolutely right, the way you approach it,
3219780	3223980	but there are so many questions that come up after,
3223980	3227340	came up for me after reading this constellation,
3227340	3232340	which for me, at least, kind of tended a bit too much
3232660	3235660	in the direction of central planning,
3235660	3238740	because I'm absolutely convinced as you are
3238740	3240380	that both is needed.
3240380	3242060	We do need central elements,
3242060	3244460	we do need decentral elements,
3244460	3249260	but from my kind of understanding,
3249260	3252580	there were so many open questions
3252580	3255900	after reading the proposal,
3255900	3258820	and most of it came out of A,
3259980	3262020	the high level of centrality,
3262020	3266020	and B, like implicit assumptions about knowledge
3266020	3269980	and where the knowledge can actually be
3269980	3272380	brought together at the end.
3272380	3275500	And this, yeah, this was just something
3275500	3278300	I ended up with at the end.
3278300	3279860	This is not really a question.
3279980	3284620	Well, thank you for expressing this.
3284620	3289620	This is a sort of an early stab, a first attempt here,
3290580	3292780	and we don't claim that our modeling here,
3292780	3294580	it's certainly not been the pause of our thought.
3294580	3296220	We continue to think about these issues.
3296220	3298820	We've continued to read new stuff,
3298820	3300620	think new stuff, think about new models.
3300620	3305620	So, I would really love to read more of other people's
3306860	3309780	thinking about how we might build a non-monetary economy
3310780	3313780	an economy that does manage to navigate
3313780	3316980	the very difficult challenge of the environmental crisis
3316980	3319740	and the amount of coordination that involves
3319740	3324740	without the undesirable consequence of over-centralization
3326300	3328900	or of our current system,
3328900	3332300	which is complete and blindly walking into disaster
3332300	3335860	that, and everyone is blind to the full picture
3335860	3338460	or not everyone, but like that we're all making
3338460	3340660	small decisions based on small incentives
3340660	3345580	and it's creating a force that just leading us to ruin.
3346540	3350340	So obviously we need a middle ground, right?
3350340	3352860	How does that middle ground get constructed?
3352860	3354340	And what we've tried to do,
3355340	3357140	and so I guess I'll respond to a couple of the comments.
3357140	3358820	So about technology never being neutral,
3358820	3361540	this is of course true.
3361540	3366540	And about technocracy never being neutral is of course true.
3366780	3367940	True.
3367940	3372140	What we tried to do is try and,
3372140	3374380	but we also think that there needs to be some,
3375580	3379220	I guess, administrative division of labor.
3379220	3382020	We don't want everyone coming into meetings every day
3382020	3383900	to plan things, I guess.
3383900	3386420	So there's some amount of administrative division of labor.
3386420	3389380	So we imagine still a parliament sort of system.
3389380	3393940	So we have this sort of elected official sort of thing
3393940	3397020	going on, which is already a compromise.
3397020	3400460	We all know how representative democracy has its failings.
3401460	3403820	And so there's all these compromises we're trying to make
3403820	3405540	along the way to try and balance
3405540	3406980	all these different tendencies.
3406980	3409300	And that technology is never neutral,
3409300	3412340	it's an important one, but that technology is,
3413220	3415220	that the tools that we have developed
3415220	3417860	to think about the world system,
3417860	3420740	the earth system scientifically,
3420740	3425740	seem to have promise in balancing environmental constraints
3427780	3428900	is also there.
3428900	3431860	And the question is, can we use this technology
3431860	3436860	in a way that is democratic and is able to be just?
3439900	3440980	I guess we're optimistic.
3440980	3441900	Yeah.
3441900	3443660	But I don't know, I'm sort of trailing off here, Troy.
3443660	3444500	What do you want to say?
3444500	3445340	Yeah, it's true.
3445340	3446460	I think you can see too much.
3446460	3448780	I mean, yeah, and I would push you to formulate
3448780	3451900	your questions or your criticism more clearly.
3451900	3455500	I mean, are you saying like, okay, no,
3455500	3458980	there's no one mind with all the knowledge in the world.
3458980	3461100	And I mean, it's kind of Hayekian argument.
3461100	3464420	And you're like, okay, sure, I agree.
3464420	3467340	But I mean, and this is why, again,
3467340	3470460	we're talking about having these layered plans.
3471460	3474220	Like the central planning, the global planning bureau
3474220	3476060	will set fairly loose guidelines
3476220	3479180	according to these planetary boundaries
3479180	3481260	and orders boundaries for a good life.
3481260	3484260	Like how many calories or energy does a person need?
3484260	3486100	And then how to actually carry that out
3486100	3490220	will be left up to regional and local government.
3491780	3496220	And so I think there's that aspect.
3496220	3497380	So I would agree with that,
3497380	3500220	but we don't make this claim of having total knowledge.
3500220	3503420	And then of course, technology isn't neutral.
3503420	3507980	I mean, sure, but I also would say that cybernetics
3507980	3512780	being some kind of like wicked military form of thinking
3512780	3515380	is also a too simple critique.
3515380	3516500	Not that I'm saying you're saying that,
3516500	3517980	but some people are of course,
3517980	3520140	are very skeptical of cybernetics for this reason.
3520140	3521900	I mean, Beer was a huge hippie.
3523380	3528380	Wiener himself was incredibly antagonistic
3528540	3532100	to the military after the war as well.
3532100	3536220	I mean, I think it's, and we're not proposing,
3536220	3538780	yeah, merely, okay, we'll just see a bunch of experts
3538780	3539620	to figure things out.
3539620	3541100	That's not what we're saying.
3541100	3542180	And again, we're trying to make this
3542180	3546060	much more Noiratian point of you have to get
3546060	3548300	as many people involved and as many people
3548300	3550860	to understand what the economy is.
3550860	3553380	And will that be perfect?
3553380	3557300	Or will everyone have complete knowledge?
3557300	3560180	No, but I think one should try.
3560180	3564180	And then how exactly does one organize socialist democracy?
3564180	3565660	Do we have referendums?
3565660	3567300	Like, do we have a parliament?
3567300	3569700	I mean, these are things we should be thinking about,
3569700	3571980	but I think the alternative to say,
3571980	3573260	oh, these things are too difficult.
3573260	3575460	And therefore we have to do a market socialism
3575460	3578300	and then rely on a market mechanism
3578300	3582580	will not suffice to solve the problems we need to solve,
3582580	3585700	which again, you know, mainly environmental problems.
3585700	3588780	If we need to have us agree at the species,
3588820	3591580	okay, we want to have only this much carbon emitted.
3591580	3594660	We want to have only this much land deforested.
3594660	3597580	If we want to stop climate change or the sixth extinction,
3597580	3599260	if only part of us agree,
3599260	3601980	then it doesn't really matter what the rest of us do.
3601980	3606420	So I mean, again, maybe if you could reformulate
3606420	3609980	what your critiques are, I'd be interested to hear it.
3609980	3611100	Yes, absolutely.
3611100	3614620	But first of all, I neither said that I think
3614620	3619620	that cybernetics is just some form of military wishwash
3619700	3620660	or anything as such.
3620660	3622660	I just pointed out that it is not,
3622660	3625900	that all these theories are not neutral in any way,
3625900	3628940	but that they do imply some pre-assumptions
3628940	3630260	that make a difference.
3630260	3633700	I'm absolutely pro, including cybernetics,
3633700	3635620	100% into our thinking.
3635620	3637740	So I'm not actually stating that.
3637740	3642100	Neither am I in any way, shape or form a market socialist.
3642100	3646300	So if you pose it like either we do it your way
3646300	3648220	or people are market socialists,
3648220	3651420	then this is also an inadequate description
3651420	3654380	of the situation between the three of us right now,
3654380	3656980	because I'm not in favor of market socialism.
3656980	3658460	So just to make that clear.
3659580	3662900	And then maybe I can make it a bit more clear
3662900	3664220	when it comes to the question of detail,
3664220	3669220	because right now you stated that the central planning board
3669340	3674340	would only kind of give out some like broad guidelines
3675900	3677020	or something like that.
3677020	3678820	And this would be something very different.
3678820	3682980	And when I read the narrative part at the end of the book,
3682980	3687980	and this is the part that maybe created this sense
3689180	3693180	of over-centrality the most, I guess,
3693180	3696500	there were some points within this narrative
3696500	3699100	where people were like, all right, okay,
3700100	3703020	because of the central board deciding
3703020	3706420	that this labor should be allocated over there
3706420	3710100	and people should do X, Y, that over there,
3710100	3714980	we will now have to kind of try to enact it.
3714980	3717260	And so there was a very clear sense
3717260	3721700	of this directionality coming from the center
3721700	3726420	in terms of the center has computed some kind of ideal plan.
3726420	3731180	And I'm being polemic here a bit just to make the argument.
3731180	3734540	There was this sense of there is this central board
3734540	3736980	computing this ideal plan.
3736980	3739980	And now we will have to find ways to enact it.
3739980	3742940	And this kind of directionality is important, I think,
3742940	3746380	because it will decide over the question
3746380	3749860	whether or not people do experience
3750700	3755700	democratic plant economies as democratic plant economies
3757260	3762260	in terms of democratic in all caps,
3763380	3768380	because this, as you rightly stated before, Drew,
3768500	3773180	this is essential to actually making this work,
3773180	3776140	because if they do not, and you do not have any types
3776300	3780100	of monetary incentives or other forms of coercions,
3780100	3782620	then this whole thing will not work out.
3782620	3787580	To me, it seems as if the way it is set up right now,
3787580	3791180	this form of over-centralization leads to a point
3791180	3796180	where the plan maybe by being too detailed
3798780	3803500	is first assuming epistemic aspects
3803500	3806140	that I guess I would not share in terms of
3806140	3809620	can this knowledge actually come together at this point?
3809620	3811940	And Troy, you were rightly so,
3811940	3813860	I think pointing towards tested knowledge
3813860	3815380	and the question of how to handle this one.
3815380	3816820	So this is the first one.
3816820	3819820	And then if it is too detailed,
3819820	3823500	and not only in the framework of like loose,
3823500	3825780	not loose, but broad guidelines,
3825780	3828820	you will come to a point where it will be experienced
3828820	3832540	as external by the people who will have to enact it.
3832580	3834180	Those are the two things.
3834180	3836580	And this makes a very big difference,
3836580	3840100	because if you, for example, look at models
3840100	3844820	where questions of economic planning are handled
3844820	3849820	through like prices for central categories of production,
3851100	3856100	then you will have a very broad set of indicative prices
3857580	3861140	that then kind of indirectly lead to a form
3861140	3865700	of coordination within the system in a very loose way.
3865700	3869460	But I had the sense that within the proposal
3869460	3871180	that you are bringing forward,
3871180	3876180	this type of detail in terms of what is planned
3876380	3879660	and what is not planned and who is involved
3879660	3883140	in which aspects of planning is a very different one.
3883140	3885660	So I hope this is a little bit more clear.
3886660	3889140	Yeah, no, this is nice.
3889140	3892020	And this is actually, this is a really good place
3892020	3894900	to be talking about the appropriate level of detail.
3894900	3899900	And I definitely think that this is,
3900100	3902380	I think the right area to be focusing on,
3902380	3903900	what is the appropriate level of detail
3903900	3905260	at each level of the plan, right?
3905260	3908220	We're imagining some sort of kind of federative, right?
3908220	3910020	Like structure right where that,
3910020	3911860	and then the concreteness goes down.
3911860	3914500	And I think what we're trying to get out with the narrative,
3914540	3916140	and I think is insufficiently clear,
3916140	3918820	is that the planning and sort of the central valley
3918820	3921740	of Massachusetts would be done in terms of like,
3921740	3924780	how many, like we have these factories
3924780	3926540	and these farms here, here, and here,
3926540	3928740	and how much labor is required for each.
3928740	3931980	And then if someone puts in an application for work
3931980	3933340	and they wanna live here,
3933340	3937500	like these are the options to choose from.
3937500	3940540	That level of detail would be at that kind of county
3940540	3942980	to city level, I guess.
3942980	3947180	And so this would not be set up by the US
3947180	3950340	or the Eastern US or the North America
3950340	3952020	or the global level, right?
3952020	3953580	It would be more like we need,
3953580	3956900	we think we want some vegetables, right?
3956900	3960620	And then we can grow some amount here, right?
3960620	3962380	But that was sort of what we were going for.
3962380	3964020	So we don't imagine that that,
3964020	3967060	we imagine that that detail is more local.
3967060	3968260	From there, we can have a conversation
3968260	3970860	about whether that's too much or too little detail.
3970860	3972220	And I think that would be a really,
3972500	3973740	that's the sort of, I think,
3973740	3976460	really nice conversation that I would love to have
3977740	3980380	in this sort of discussions of how we might do planning.
3980380	3981220	And the question of,
3981220	3984980	do you, quantities, do you do indicative prices?
3984980	3988820	Do you do, what is your mechanism for doing this?
3988820	3992380	We've been talking about sort of in the Torah units.
3992380	3994220	So like, we, I guess, have been leaning more
3994220	3998540	on the sort of quota such quantity side of planning,
3998540	3999820	but perhaps there could be a case
3999820	4003060	that in for playing certain aspects of things,
4003060	4005420	an indicative price and then allowing things to do this
4005420	4007460	in some controlled way might be a reasonable way
4007460	4010060	of doing local planning or something like this.
4010060	4013620	I think we kind of intentionally leave it a little vague
4013620	4015020	about how these plans are carried out.
4015020	4017100	So I think,
4017980	4019820	I don't actually think we disagree very much,
4019820	4021660	which is of course a classic thing for me to say,
4021660	4023140	but I think, I don't actually think we,
4023140	4026500	I think this is the sort of detail
4026500	4029220	that we kind of didn't flush out too much in the book,
4029220	4030460	maybe to our own detriment.
4030460	4033460	The book is quite short, just for listeners to know.
4033460	4035980	We cover a lot of ground at a very high level,
4035980	4037940	which might get us in trouble.
4037940	4039820	But I think,
4039820	4042100	I think that this is a good conversation.
4042100	4044420	I would be nice to build up a more detailed model
4044420	4045620	to like answer all these questions
4045620	4046820	and try and think about like,
4046820	4047940	what the right level of detail is,
4047940	4050820	what planning tools might be used at different levels?
4050820	4053140	What is the appropriate level of detail at different levels
4053140	4054540	in terms of both information gathering
4054540	4056460	and in terms of both experiencing it
4056460	4058980	as a non-coercive system?
4061060	4062460	I don't know if that was coherent,
4062460	4064820	but those are my thoughts to what you just said.
4064820	4067580	Yes, and I mean, I just want to point out
4067580	4070140	that there were a couple of things
4070140	4072500	that I really liked about reading all of this.
4072500	4074460	So that it's not that I was reading
4074460	4076460	and it was constantly thinking,
4076460	4081460	oh my God, this is too authoritarian central planning.
4082020	4084860	There were quite some elements that I really enjoyed.
4084860	4088500	For example, this whole engagement
4088500	4090260	with the question of modeling
4090260	4094500	and how this could be a nested way of modeling
4094500	4098180	in order to kind of avoid this idea
4098180	4102220	of just having one central point
4102220	4104180	where the data comes together.
4104180	4106620	Because as you state in the book,
4106620	4109740	in the case of climate modeling and weather modeling,
4109740	4111380	this could never be accurate
4111380	4116340	because you will have to have a form of nested approach
4116340	4118500	in order to get to a point
4118500	4123500	where you will be able to more or less get a picture
4123580	4128100	and an idea of a very, very dynamic system
4128100	4130780	that you are trying to get an idea of.
4130780	4133540	So I thought this was really interesting
4133540	4136860	and I immediately thought,
4136860	4138340	okay, well, this would be interesting
4138340	4141180	to get into contact with some people
4141180	4142340	who are actually doing this
4142340	4146860	and how this could be then re-appropriated
4146860	4151860	to kind of use this Neurethian innatura approach
4152580	4156500	that you obviously like very much.
4156500	4160860	And since this was a really big question mark for me,
4160860	4165860	how would this innatura calculation actually look like?
4166140	4170860	I didn't really immediately had an inner image or idea
4170860	4173060	how this would be approached in concrete terms
4173060	4175140	because of course there are so many things
4176220	4180100	that a modern economy is made up of
4180100	4183660	that comparing everything innatura, of course,
4183660	4188260	kind of brings you in a difficult spot as well.
4188260	4190300	And since I was very much interested
4190300	4194380	in how to approach actual innatura calculation
4194380	4196420	in modern economies, and on the other hand,
4196420	4200100	you were pointing towards these types of modern modeling,
4200140	4203580	I was very much intrigued in how this would go about
4203580	4206420	or how do you think about this pair
4206420	4211100	which I was perceiving as an interesting fit actually.
4211100	4214500	I suppose like the next step for this kind of project
4214500	4216980	would be to think more seriously
4216980	4219740	about making like a world model, right?
4219740	4224740	And then, or work with people on regional or local model.
4224900	4228780	Let's just assume the global model says this,
4228780	4233340	and how would, let's say, Austria figure it out
4233340	4236620	and what would Vienna look like based on those constraints
4236620	4238100	and kind of work it out.
4238100	4240660	I think this is, again, the Neurathian part
4240660	4244060	where socialism is imagining these features
4244060	4248180	and having discussions about how we should live.
4248180	4252380	But you're right where I think the innatura
4254820	4258140	parts of the plan would have to be a different radiance
4258180	4260220	of detail, and I think,
4261220	4264700	and I can imagine, you would just say,
4264700	4267260	like how large is the chemical industry
4267260	4272180	or how many fertilizer or pesticides do you want?
4272180	4275220	And then, as in you could have some kind of way
4275220	4277460	to group that, but then there would also be a way
4277460	4280540	to zero in and say, okay, what does that look like
4280540	4285060	in terms of phosphorus versus ammonia and so forth, right?
4285060	4288060	And I think you want to have enough,
4288060	4290420	less detail to look at these things in total,
4290420	4292260	which again, we try to get into the book
4292260	4294340	because we want people to really engage
4294340	4297700	with these questions of energy and land use
4297700	4300140	and the kind of nature we want.
4301540	4304140	And then one can zero in if they want.
4305140	4309620	Great, so at the end of every interview,
4309620	4312220	I ask my guests, if you think about the future,
4312220	4313900	what makes you joyful?
4315100	4320100	I think writing this book has been a joyful experience
4320140	4324620	because at some level, I think it's possible for us
4324620	4327220	to overcome the environmental crisis
4327220	4329020	and to overcome capitalism
4329020	4330940	and to ensure the good life for all
4330940	4333580	without sliding into some horrible dictatorship.
4333580	4338460	I think it's not beyond humanity at some level.
4338460	4342820	And we just want to convince more people
4342820	4343860	that this is the case,
4343860	4346380	because otherwise there's too much doom and gloom.
4347580	4349220	Yeah, I think in writing this book,
4349220	4352260	we've encountered people who are thinking very hard
4352260	4355860	about issues like the practical details
4355860	4357260	of transcending capitalism
4357260	4360220	rather than simply critiquing, critiquing, critiquing.
4360220	4364020	It's easy to critique, but as soon as you offer something,
4364020	4365980	then people can come after you,
4365980	4368300	which is good because it helps us refine our ideas.
4368300	4372380	But it's being introduced to all these people
4372380	4374740	thinking about these issues has been really, really wonderful.
4374740	4378460	And it makes me very excited that we can hammer out
4378460	4380380	the details in an appropriate way
4380380	4384420	that we are able to walk these many tight ropes
4384420	4387620	that we'll need to walk to build the future we all want.
4389460	4392100	Great, and I hope you didn't get the sense
4392100	4395020	that I was coming after you because I wasn't.
4395020	4398780	I really enjoyed that you were putting out
4398780	4401940	this concrete ideas on how things could be approached
4401940	4405420	because I absolutely agree that we do need more
4405420	4407740	of this type of engagement
4407740	4411180	with how things could actually be done differently.
4412500	4417020	No, no, I mean, this Think Tank podcast is amazing
4417020	4419300	because there aren't that many that really get
4419300	4422860	into the nitty-gritty of planning theory.
4422860	4426180	And it's been a real joy to listen to your podcast
4426180	4430340	and to have a place where we can really get into the weeds
4430340	4433540	of some of the more obscure stuff in the book
4433540	4437220	because not everyone wants to talk about Soviet mathematics.
4437220	4440100	So thanks so much for having us.
4440100	4441220	Thank you too.
4441220	4443180	Yeah, this was really great.
4443180	4445860	Yeah, it would be wonderful to talk even more
4445860	4450620	and think more and maybe we have this iterative democracy
4450620	4453980	thing for a Philip Dapricks conference
4453980	4456300	in late June, early July.
4456300	4458820	So maybe we could get more feedback there.
4458820	4460620	So, I mean, we're still working and thinking.
4460620	4463820	So, I mean, hopefully we can continue to talk
4463820	4465460	and develop ideas.
4465460	4466300	Perfect.
