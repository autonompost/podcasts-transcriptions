00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

00:06.000 --> 00:08.520
David Leibman in today's show.

00:08.520 --> 00:14.680
He is Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brooklyn College, New York and editor of the journals

00:14.680 --> 00:16.960
Science and Society.

00:16.960 --> 00:22.020
David has written extensively about economic coordination and developed a model called

00:22.020 --> 00:28.240
Multi-Level Democratic Iterative Coordination, which will be at the center of our conversation

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
today.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.680
I am absolutely thrilled that this episode came together and that it did so right now

00:34.680 --> 00:41.160
because the new special issue of Science and Society's project Envisioning Socialism has

00:41.160 --> 00:48.560
just been published and these special issues, they are released only once every 10 years

00:48.560 --> 00:53.320
and are concerned with a topic that is of great importance for the investigations of

00:53.320 --> 00:58.440
this podcast and that is democratic economic planning.

00:58.440 --> 01:07.560
The three predecessor issues appeared in Science and Society in Spring 1992, 2002 and 2012

01:07.560 --> 01:16.360
and so I marked my calendar for Spring 2022 in order not to miss this very special opportunity

01:16.360 --> 01:21.280
and I am very happy to announce that I did not only record the interview with David Leibman

01:21.280 --> 01:27.360
that you are about to hear today, but also lengthy conversations with Robin Hannell and

01:27.520 --> 01:33.920
with Pat Devine who are both, just like David, enormously important contributors not only

01:33.920 --> 01:41.060
to these special issues starting from the first one in 1992, but they are also central

01:41.060 --> 01:47.360
contributors to the debate around democratic economic planning in general.

01:47.360 --> 01:52.240
This means there will be quite a couple of English language future histories episodes

01:52.240 --> 01:59.240
spread over this spring and summer devoted to the topic of democratic economic planning

01:59.240 --> 02:02.240
and I have a couple of remarks regarding this.

02:02.240 --> 02:08.980
The first one would be to my German language audience, I am sorry, I had to do it, I simply

02:08.980 --> 02:16.580
had to do this, Future Histories is a predominantly German language podcast and it will continue

02:16.580 --> 02:25.080
to be so, but this was simply too perfect and so I couldn't resist and as regular listeners

02:25.080 --> 02:31.380
will know, I argue for podcasting as a form of extended research practice and this deep

02:31.380 --> 02:39.060
dive into democratic economic planning is to be understood as a part of exactly that.

02:39.060 --> 02:45.580
So danke fÃ¼r eure Geduld, thank you for your patience with this long detour into English

02:45.580 --> 02:52.960
language episodes and in the spirit of podcasting as research, I have an important plea directed

02:52.960 --> 02:54.600
at all of you.

02:54.600 --> 03:00.580
At one point in the interview you are about to hear with David, he states, and I quote,

03:00.580 --> 03:06.440
the truly international discussion is still in front of us, end quote, and I could not

03:06.440 --> 03:13.280
agree more, so please, if you know about interesting positions on democratic economic planning

03:13.280 --> 03:17.360
from the global south, then please write me.

03:17.360 --> 03:22.940
If everything works out as planned, I will feature guests from Chile soon and planning

03:22.940 --> 03:29.080
in Kerala, India is also on my radar, as is the history of Soviet cybernetics, but I cannot

03:29.080 --> 03:31.720
stress this enough.

03:31.720 --> 03:36.660
If you know about interesting contemporary thinkers or experiments in democratic economic

03:36.660 --> 03:43.260
planning from the global south and non-western positions in general, then please write me.

03:43.260 --> 03:52.200
You can reach me via jan at futurehistories.today, that's J-A-N at futurehistories.today.

03:52.200 --> 03:58.060
Very much looking forward to hearing about all these different approaches and experiments

03:58.060 --> 04:00.600
from all over the world.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.760
So now please enjoy today's episode with David Leibman on multi-level democratic iterative

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
coordination.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
Welcome David.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
Okay.

04:15.760 --> 04:16.760
Thank you Jan.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.440
It's good to be here.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.520
It's my pleasure.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.840
Before we get to your model specifically, let's start with a very basic definition.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.600
What is democratic economic planning?

04:28.600 --> 04:29.600
Okay.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.540
I was going to back up a little further before that, but I'll get to democratic economic

04:34.540 --> 04:38.040
planning in a moment.

04:38.040 --> 04:43.940
I wanted to start by referring to all of the buzz in the world around the concept of socialism

04:43.940 --> 04:45.180
as such.

04:45.180 --> 04:51.420
There's a lot of discussion of socialism, a renewal of interest, and this is of course

04:51.420 --> 04:58.300
very important for us, I think, and very important for the way the world is going to go.

04:58.300 --> 05:03.340
So I wanted to suggest a few distinctions.

05:03.340 --> 05:10.320
For many people, the word socialism means what I call ameliorative socialism, ameliorate,

05:10.320 --> 05:15.760
make better, improve, and they can think of, and I can think of, all sorts of improvements

05:15.760 --> 05:19.480
that we want to make in the world.

05:19.480 --> 05:25.200
We want a world of equality, a world of solidarity, a world of participation, a world of security,

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
dignity.

05:26.200 --> 05:32.160
These are some words that clearly come into the concept, and I'm happy to situate all

05:32.160 --> 05:38.900
the work that I'm doing, and everyone who's working on what I call systemic socialism

05:38.900 --> 05:43.940
would be part of, you know, we're all part of that, but we need to go further.

05:43.940 --> 05:50.420
The second distinction is what I call inspirational socialism, and it takes its cue from some

05:50.420 --> 05:55.760
phrases from the classics of Marxism, and not only Marxism, but there are inspirational

05:55.760 --> 06:00.660
socialists who refer to thinkers going much farther back.

06:00.660 --> 06:04.880
And here you have phrases like the world of the associated producers and the working

06:04.880 --> 06:09.860
class in power and the commonwealth of toil.

06:09.860 --> 06:15.900
One can go on and on, you know, with these wonderful inspirational phrases from the past,

06:15.900 --> 06:21.060
and the kind of socialism that I, and I gather many of the people who have participated in

06:21.060 --> 06:29.500
your symposium series, is interested in, is going beyond that.

06:29.540 --> 06:35.420
In other words, we need to not just talk in general terms about the working class in power,

06:35.420 --> 06:42.700
or to use a phrase from the manifesto where Marx and Engels speak about the condition

06:42.700 --> 06:48.380
for the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all, you know,

06:48.380 --> 06:54.140
this kind of language, which is wonderful, but it clearly needs to be transcended.

06:54.140 --> 06:59.860
We need to put some meat on those bones, so to speak.

06:59.860 --> 07:06.940
And finally, you have speculative socialism, you know, speculative utopian, where just

07:06.940 --> 07:13.820
like the kind of thing that Marx was so concerned to transcend in the early part of the 19th

07:13.820 --> 07:20.140
century, where there were all these writers, some of them very brilliant, putting forward

07:20.140 --> 07:25.740
completely arbitrary idealist visions of how things would work and telling everybody

07:25.740 --> 07:29.860
things will be done this way, and you will have this kind of institution and that kind

07:29.860 --> 07:30.860
of institution.

07:30.860 --> 07:33.260
And Marx wanted to get away from that totally.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.300
So what's left?

07:34.300 --> 07:42.060
What's left is what I call systemic socialism, which is somewhere in a middle ground between

07:42.060 --> 07:49.180
simply saying we want to strive for equality and so forth, the thing, the values that socialists

07:49.180 --> 07:59.660
uphold on one side versus a kind of utopian or speculative arbitrary engineering of institutions,

07:59.660 --> 08:01.820
which Marx was quite clear.

08:01.820 --> 08:07.700
And I think most of his followers have gone along, gone on from that.

08:07.700 --> 08:14.860
You simply can't preordain, you can't write what Marx called recipes for the cook shops

08:14.860 --> 08:15.860
of the future.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.140
It just doesn't work.

08:17.420 --> 08:22.460
You have to see socialism as something that grows organically within the existing society

08:22.460 --> 08:29.780
and partakes of all of that history and sort of concentrates that history.

08:29.780 --> 08:34.660
So it's in that framework that I would talk about democratic coordination, democratic

08:34.660 --> 08:35.780
economic planning.

08:35.780 --> 08:46.420
And yes, like as with my colleagues, Pat Devine, Robin Hanell, Al Campbell, Cockshot and Cottrell,

08:46.980 --> 08:53.060
Alan Cottrell and a new contributor who works with them, Dave Zechariah and many others

08:53.060 --> 08:54.260
who don't write in English.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.540
And for that, I apologize.

08:56.740 --> 09:00.660
I do read some Spanish and some Russian, but not enough to really say that I can

09:01.620 --> 09:05.060
represent the people who write in those languages.

09:06.020 --> 09:10.500
And the truly international discussion that we need is still in front of us.

09:11.140 --> 09:12.500
We haven't yet achieved that.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.940
And I'm as much to blame as anyone for that.

09:15.940 --> 09:22.020
But anyway, we're all talking about democratic economic planning and trying to figure out

09:22.020 --> 09:24.020
what that could possibly mean.

09:24.020 --> 09:32.020
So that's a sort of a preamble that gets us to the doorstep of the question we need to pursue.

09:33.060 --> 09:38.420
And apart from the way that you approach it specifically within your model, is there

09:38.420 --> 09:42.100
some kind of definition of democratic economic planning that you could provide?

09:42.900 --> 09:47.140
Well, I think the definition emerges in each of the separate models.

09:47.140 --> 09:52.420
And I'll have something to say about that, because what I've tried to do in a recent paper,

09:54.020 --> 10:00.180
the subtitle of which is A Model of the Models, clearly the subtitle implies what I'm trying to

10:00.180 --> 10:06.580
do is look at the way the various models are related to each other and to understand whether

10:06.580 --> 10:10.500
some kind of synthesis might be possible.

10:10.500 --> 10:16.900
When I know you have a separate agenda, we'll talk about the science and society special issue.

10:17.540 --> 10:22.260
And here I'm tempted to hold it up and show everybody, but I realize there's no visual here.

10:22.260 --> 10:23.700
We're on audio only.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.540
But it just came out.

10:25.540 --> 10:32.660
We have the special issue of science and society, which is the fourth special issue,

10:33.300 --> 10:44.020
which have been issued at 10-year intervals in the 02 years, in 1992, 2002, 2012, and now 2022.

10:44.020 --> 10:48.020
You know, at specific 10-year intervals, kind of why it worked out that way, but it didn't.

10:49.540 --> 10:54.420
And on the re-envisioning of socialism or envisioning of socialism and

10:55.780 --> 11:01.780
what struck me about the work in those issues, it made a real attempt to bring everybody in

11:02.660 --> 11:08.500
we brought in proponents of market socialism, which is the idea that,

11:09.460 --> 11:12.900
first of all, very important contribution markets and socialism are separable.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.060
They're not the markets and capitalism.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.900
Sorry, I misspoke.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.420
Markets and capitalism are separate.

11:18.420 --> 11:19.460
They're not the same thing.

11:19.460 --> 11:24.660
And that you can combine the advantages of markets with the advantages of socialism into

11:24.660 --> 11:26.100
something called market social.

11:26.100 --> 11:31.220
It's not my view, but it is one of the views that we sought to represent and various views

11:31.220 --> 11:35.300
of economic planning and democratic economic planning on the other side.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.580
Put them in a whole big circle.

11:37.540 --> 11:44.180
My perception of this from 1992 forward as we did this work was that

11:47.620 --> 11:50.660
people were talking past each other to some extent.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.980
We were saying something in one of the special issues.

11:53.620 --> 11:58.900
And then those of us who repeated and participated in the next special issue

11:58.900 --> 12:00.340
were saying the same things again.

12:01.300 --> 12:08.180
But that to use a very favorite socialist economic term convergence, convergence was

12:08.180 --> 12:09.140
not occurring.

12:09.140 --> 12:11.460
In other words, we didn't seem to be getting closer together.

12:11.460 --> 12:14.260
We didn't seem to be moving forward in that sense.

12:14.980 --> 12:20.900
And part of my recent work is an effort to overcome that or an effort, at least to address

12:20.900 --> 12:28.340
it, to address the problem of synthesis, convergence, transcendence, moving on to another stage.

12:29.780 --> 12:34.820
So that if we have another special issue in another 10 years, I won't be around to see

12:34.820 --> 12:37.380
it, but it'll be, you might.

12:40.660 --> 12:44.740
It won't look the same as the one that came before, the one that came before that.

12:44.740 --> 12:46.820
It will have moved forward.

12:47.940 --> 12:55.620
Of course, a lot depends on the world moving forward and the progressive and working class

12:55.620 --> 12:59.300
movements of the world moving forward and taking these things to heart.

13:01.220 --> 13:06.020
And that is something that I cannot directly influence, but can hope for.

13:08.340 --> 13:12.340
Anyway, I like also to take it a little further.

13:12.340 --> 13:17.780
I like also to distinguish between different stages of socialism.

13:18.660 --> 13:25.540
And here lies a major confusion in my view that is very present in many of our minds

13:26.180 --> 13:29.540
we fall into it, we mix these things up.

13:30.260 --> 13:34.340
We forget whether we're talking about stages of historical development.

13:34.340 --> 13:37.620
And if we're talking about that, then we definitely mean

13:39.300 --> 13:44.180
looking at actual historical societies in all their complexity, where you have the

13:45.220 --> 13:48.420
coexistence of different social forms.

13:49.060 --> 13:54.900
You have the coexistence of state administratively

13:54.900 --> 14:00.020
organized production, production directly under political control and managed by a

14:00.020 --> 14:05.460
bureaucracy of some kind that's carrying out the coordination functions and the

14:06.260 --> 14:07.220
control functions.

14:08.020 --> 14:11.620
And those bureaucracies have existed for thousands of years.

14:12.420 --> 14:16.900
You might just as well call some of the dynasties of ancient China

14:16.900 --> 14:21.300
socialists because they were very large and sometimes very efficient.

14:22.020 --> 14:28.180
Surprisingly, so if you look into that history, systems of coordination with legal structures,

14:28.180 --> 14:32.020
which the Chinese ancient philosophers were concerned to elaborate.

14:32.580 --> 14:37.220
And of course, they've existed in the modern world in recent centuries and they continue to exist.

14:38.100 --> 14:43.700
So you take a country like China, for example, which has a large and important state sector,

14:43.700 --> 14:48.500
but that state sector also has state-owned enterprises, SOEs,

14:49.300 --> 14:53.300
which are often managed and run on a small scale.

14:53.300 --> 14:57.700
They're managed locally, but they exist as state-owned enterprises.

14:58.260 --> 15:02.260
And in the midst of that, you have capitalist enterprises competing with them.

15:02.260 --> 15:07.300
As we know, there's been some resurgence of actual capitalist relations in China, plus

15:07.300 --> 15:14.100
cooperatives, plus the international capitalist sector in special zones, where some regulations

15:14.100 --> 15:15.780
apply to them and so forth and so on.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.580
In other words, you have a huge mix of systems.

15:18.580 --> 15:26.340
You have a mixed economy, to use a phrase from the Western political economy literature.

15:27.700 --> 15:34.180
And if socialist relations are, to the extent that social relations are dominant there,

15:34.180 --> 15:36.500
you might call it a socialist mixed economy.

15:36.500 --> 15:41.780
In fact, that's what the Chinese Communist Party basically puts forward as its view of themselves,

15:41.860 --> 15:48.260
the market economy, with Chinese market socialism, with Chinese characteristics,

15:48.260 --> 15:50.580
you know the phraseology that they use.

15:52.420 --> 15:57.780
And from my point of view, that is all on one side.

15:57.780 --> 16:04.820
What the model, the MDIC model, as you named it, multi-level democratic iterative coordination,

16:05.460 --> 16:07.060
is about is not that.

16:07.060 --> 16:11.460
It's not about combination of different things in historical admixture

16:11.460 --> 16:15.300
with all of the contradictions and complexities that accompany that.

16:15.300 --> 16:15.800
Not that.

16:16.420 --> 16:26.340
It's a model of the way core institutions in the modern socialist economy interact with one another

16:27.220 --> 16:30.260
and mutually determine each other.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.500
That is the central idea, what we'll be talking about in a little while.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.100
That's the main thing I want to get to.

16:39.060 --> 16:45.380
The point, just to finish this up, about the stages, confusion that exists,

16:46.180 --> 16:54.980
is that it has overtaken huge sectors, not just of the mainstream capitalist intellectual environment

16:56.340 --> 17:01.220
where these people talk about mixed economies and institutions from here and there,

17:01.300 --> 17:09.140
and the eclectic picture, transforming the complexity of the real world that they

17:09.140 --> 17:16.100
observe into their theory directly with no organization, with no intervention on the part

17:16.100 --> 17:17.060
of logic.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.340
So you have the Cubans, for example.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.620
They have their regular party congresses.

17:23.620 --> 17:28.820
And obviously, discussion is going on all the time there, not just at the party congresses,

17:28.820 --> 17:33.540
but it becomes very prominent at those periods when they wrestle with the question of what they

17:33.540 --> 17:34.340
call reform.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.660
The question is exactly the same as the Chinese question.

17:40.660 --> 17:46.900
It's how can we mix socialism, I'm putting inverted commas, quotation marks around the word

17:46.900 --> 17:51.860
socialism here, which means state production, state central planning, etc.

17:51.860 --> 17:58.020
How can we mix that with just the right amount of, now quotation marks again, capitalism,

17:59.620 --> 18:05.460
so that we get the advantages of capitalism, a spur to incentive, competition, dynamism.

18:05.460 --> 18:12.020
That's what capitalism gives us, whereas the state sector gives us what we like from socialism,

18:12.740 --> 18:21.460
security, equality, coordination, addressing the ecological problems which are always at the

18:21.460 --> 18:23.780
forefront of our minds, those kinds of things.

18:24.180 --> 18:28.980
How can we, so they're not talking about socialism, and I'm talking about the fundamental

18:28.980 --> 18:32.500
levels of the Cuban leadership and of the Chinese leadership.

18:33.700 --> 18:39.060
They're talking about a socialist capitalist mixed economy, the advantages of both.

18:39.060 --> 18:42.660
And if you read their literature, that's very much the way the thinking goes.

18:43.540 --> 18:49.220
Now, the implication of that is there's a one way highway with strong central planning,

18:49.940 --> 18:56.580
state control at one end of the spectrum, and total deregulation market processes,

18:56.580 --> 18:59.780
atomistic competition and so forth at the other end of the spectrum.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.220
That's your spectrum.

19:01.220 --> 19:04.420
And what we need is a mixed economy somewhere in the middle.

19:06.180 --> 19:11.460
In some ways, it's not too different from the Keynesian conception within mainstream economics.

19:13.460 --> 19:19.060
The mix of private and with the appropriate degree of state intervention or state intervention with

19:19.060 --> 19:23.940
the appropriate mix of market competition in order to spice it up a little bit.

19:23.940 --> 19:25.380
I think that's totally wrong.

19:26.020 --> 19:34.100
I think MDIC and the other models that people have put forward is on a different dimension.

19:34.100 --> 19:41.460
It's what the word, I'll just say perpendicular to, it's often in a different direction.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.340
It's not that at all.

19:43.060 --> 19:48.100
So if people say, and friends of mine in Cuba have said this, we need reform.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.980
I say, well, reform in which direction?

19:52.980 --> 19:56.020
In which direction are you going to reform?

19:56.820 --> 20:02.820
And so multi-level democratic iterative coordination, if I can use my term,

20:02.820 --> 20:06.260
the way I put it together, other people have different terms, of course,

20:06.260 --> 20:10.900
is not somewhere on the spectrum between the market and central planning.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.460
It's something completely different from it.

20:14.180 --> 20:20.660
And that's the essential idea that I want to try to get across.

20:21.780 --> 20:22.500
Yes, great.

20:22.500 --> 20:30.260
And I mean, I can only highlight that we absolutely need an alternative because I mean,

20:30.260 --> 20:36.820
it's not only, as you referenced, someone like Keynes who posits this as if there was only

20:36.820 --> 20:42.020
hierarchical central planning or absolute atomistic market forces.

20:42.020 --> 20:49.140
It's also Hayek who famously used this dichotomy as if it was only this or that.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.540
And then we definitely have to transcend it.

20:51.540 --> 20:55.860
And so I'm very happy to talk about exactly that with you today.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.220
So let's get to your model.

20:58.020 --> 21:03.060
Could you maybe as a start, give us a broad overview of multi-level

21:03.060 --> 21:05.220
democratic iterative coordination?

21:05.220 --> 21:06.660
What's the basic structure?

21:06.660 --> 21:09.540
What are the basic assumptions and premises of your model?

21:10.500 --> 21:16.980
Oh, when you take the concept of democratic planning, just take those two words.

21:18.180 --> 21:20.260
An average person is going to scratch their head.

21:20.260 --> 21:23.700
They're going to say, what in the world can you possibly be talking about?

21:24.340 --> 21:29.220
Planning is creating something according to a single consistent vision.

21:30.100 --> 21:35.780
When a painter plans a painting, he doesn't consult a whole roomful of people and say,

21:35.780 --> 21:37.060
well, should I put a tree here?

21:37.700 --> 21:40.900
Should I put a house there or a stream there?

21:40.900 --> 21:43.860
The conception has to be kind of integral.

21:43.860 --> 21:47.300
It's kind of almost inherently coordinated.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.460
That's in the concept of planning.

21:49.460 --> 21:57.060
Democracy, on the other hand, is a multitude of individual wills pulling in different directions.

21:58.020 --> 22:02.660
Now, if you're not going to coordinate that with a market or with elections in the

22:02.660 --> 22:06.420
political sphere, we'll just decide by having votes.

22:07.700 --> 22:14.580
If you're not going to coordinate that way, how are you going to combine planning and democracy?

22:16.020 --> 22:20.260
If people are involved in planning, they're going to say, well, someone's going to say,

22:20.260 --> 22:21.300
I think we should do this.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
And someone else is going to say, I think we should do that.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.740
Well, what if this and that don't work, don't fit together?

22:27.300 --> 22:30.580
Someone else is going to have to figure out a way to reconcile them.

22:31.220 --> 22:38.740
It might take the form of a compromise or something is going to have to happen.

22:41.060 --> 22:45.780
Anything you want to say about the constraints so that nobody's vital interests are threatened, sure.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.660
We can obviously bring that on board.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.380
But you still have a conflict.

22:52.740 --> 22:53.860
This is the binary.

22:53.860 --> 22:58.900
You referred to it before, the idea, and it's present in Hayek and the libertarian

22:58.900 --> 23:03.220
thinkers at one end of the spectrum, plus the mixed economy people.

23:03.220 --> 23:04.420
Everyone is worried about this.

23:04.420 --> 23:06.580
But you never get away from that single dimension.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.580
You never get away from that single idea that somehow we're going to have to

23:11.620 --> 23:15.860
find some kind of a muddled up compromise in the middle if you want that.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.940
If you're Hayek, you want to stay at one end.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.460
But that's clear.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.020
How are you going to do this?

23:24.180 --> 23:31.620
The answer that emerged from the experience of first attempt socialist construction

23:31.620 --> 23:38.420
in the 20th century is the iterative concept.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.980
So I can start with that in answer to your question.

23:40.980 --> 23:46.900
It was a central aspect of multi-level democratic iterative coordination.

23:48.820 --> 23:50.900
The idea is really very simple.

23:51.700 --> 23:55.220
The center, I'm going to speak of the center and the enterprise.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.940
I'm going to speak of, first of all, I'm going to speak of two levels.

23:57.940 --> 24:03.380
The model says multi-level, and that implies there could be more than two, which we could

24:03.380 --> 24:09.460
analyze later, but I'll work with a simple conception of two levels, top and bottom,

24:09.460 --> 24:12.580
center, and I don't want to say periphery.

24:12.580 --> 24:16.260
That brings in another level of thinking.

24:16.260 --> 24:31.300
The center essentially defines a brand plan for one of its enterprises, for all of its

24:31.300 --> 24:36.900
enterprises, but we'll talk about a particular one, which is the basic nature of the enterprise,

24:36.900 --> 24:42.660
the basic nature of its function, the kind of goods or services that it delivers

24:44.580 --> 24:45.860
to the society as a whole.

24:47.220 --> 24:51.940
And it says, this is what we see as your baseline.

24:51.940 --> 24:58.500
Essentially, this is a point at which my model says the enterprise is not autonomous.

24:59.700 --> 25:07.060
Now, there's an idea out there, which is another one of these unanalyzed terms that

25:07.060 --> 25:13.300
people sometimes use a lot, self-management, and a lot of pro-socialist and socialist advocacy

25:13.700 --> 25:18.020
people speak about self-management, and what we have to have is a lot of self-management.

25:18.020 --> 25:20.980
If you analyze self-management, you have to ask, what does that mean?

25:20.980 --> 25:21.860
Who is the self?

25:23.060 --> 25:25.860
And of course, the self is a hierarchy of levels.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.100
At one level, the self is a single individual.

25:29.860 --> 25:34.500
At another level, the self is the society as a whole, but who speaks for the society as a whole?

25:35.300 --> 25:37.220
And there are many intermediate levels.

25:37.220 --> 25:41.780
There are sort of like non-governmental organizations.

25:41.780 --> 25:45.620
There are stakeholders at middle levels of that process.

25:45.620 --> 25:49.060
Some of the people you've been talking to and are continuing to talk to talk about

25:49.060 --> 25:52.100
stakeholders a lot and stakeholder democracy.

25:52.100 --> 25:52.600
Good.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.420
So there are all these levels.

25:56.180 --> 25:59.700
The enterprise belongs to society as a whole.

26:00.980 --> 26:05.060
Society as a whole consists essentially, let's assume, of its working people.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.660
It is the working class in power.

26:07.540 --> 26:08.040
Okay.

26:08.900 --> 26:16.740
We'll assume that remnants of the billionaire class are no longer a significant social force.

26:16.740 --> 26:17.240
They're gone.

26:18.580 --> 26:22.100
So everyone is working people, but with all differentiations within us,

26:22.980 --> 26:26.420
different kinds of work and different levels.

26:27.220 --> 26:30.180
But that's the overall social control of the enterprise.

26:30.180 --> 26:33.140
So the first starting point is the enterprise can't simply

26:34.020 --> 26:39.060
sell its assets and move to another country or change fields completely,

26:39.060 --> 26:43.140
change from being in manufacturing production and move over to

26:44.180 --> 26:47.220
services or agriculture or something else.

26:48.020 --> 26:51.140
The enterprise has a defined role and it has certain

26:52.660 --> 26:54.740
properties that have been devolved upon.

26:54.740 --> 26:57.220
It means a production that are under its control

26:57.540 --> 27:03.060
and which it is responsible to society for the management of.

27:03.860 --> 27:12.820
So I guess the first point is the production units of our MDIC socialist economy are not

27:12.820 --> 27:21.540
autonomous entities existing without any connection to the rest of themselves,

27:21.540 --> 27:23.380
the rest of the economy.

27:23.540 --> 27:27.540
And so that's the first level of control.

27:28.100 --> 27:33.700
Now, from that point onward, the enterprises are responsible for determining their plan.

27:34.900 --> 27:42.420
They're responsible for figuring out for the forthcoming period what they're going to do.

27:44.500 --> 27:51.380
And this is the importance of the planning phase as well as the execution phase.

27:51.700 --> 27:58.580
Planning in highly authoritarian systems like the capitalist one,

28:00.580 --> 28:04.420
people say, don't worry about planning, it's the results that matter.

28:05.380 --> 28:10.500
It even works its way into the epistemology of the economic theorists, positivism.

28:11.540 --> 28:13.940
We're interested in results, don't worry about planning.

28:13.940 --> 28:16.820
Planning sort of takes place in the head of the entrepreneur

28:17.540 --> 28:21.780
and is kind of a fleeting moment that we can hardly analyze.

28:23.700 --> 28:30.420
But a socialist conception sees planning and execution as two interrelated phases.

28:30.980 --> 28:36.340
They aren't separate in time, although in early phases of 20th century planning often they were.

28:36.980 --> 28:42.260
But the planning and execution are simultaneous but never merged into one another.

28:42.260 --> 28:46.340
They flow into one another, but they have distinct qualities.

28:47.140 --> 28:53.300
So you have a central body which essentially at the beginning of

28:54.020 --> 28:59.140
what I'll call the planning phase of this process says, okay, get started.

28:59.140 --> 29:03.300
And the key thing is that the enterprise is responsible for figuring that out.

29:03.300 --> 29:08.500
The enterprise has to figure out what it will produce, the quantity of output that it's going

29:08.500 --> 29:13.940
to target, the assortment of that output, the quality of the output, the measures of quality,

29:14.900 --> 29:21.460
the intended, a rough idea of the intended recipients of the output, where the demand

29:21.460 --> 29:27.380
will come from, how the output will be distributed to either other producers or final

29:28.580 --> 29:32.180
stores for distribution to consumers.

29:33.860 --> 29:36.420
The enterprise will have to figure out its technology plan.

29:37.220 --> 29:41.780
It'll have to figure out what resources it wants to devote to technical progress.

29:42.740 --> 29:47.060
It'll have to make organizational goals and set them.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.580
It'll have to do all these things.

29:51.460 --> 29:56.740
And then that will require a lot of interactions with the rest of the economy

29:56.740 --> 29:58.900
because there's a great deal of division of labor.

30:00.340 --> 30:05.540
And therefore there will have to be exchange in the raw sense that goods will have to move

30:05.540 --> 30:10.180
from one producing unit to another, goods and resources of all different kinds,

30:10.180 --> 30:15.700
including human resources, will have to be shared out and allocated and coordinated.

30:17.300 --> 30:23.860
So the enterprise, when it produces its plan, has all sorts of implicit demands upon the rest

30:23.860 --> 30:28.660
of society, raw materials that it needs, our sources, et cetera, et cetera.

30:30.500 --> 30:37.460
And in the next round of this iterative process, the center has to take all that and say,

30:37.460 --> 30:38.900
does it fit or doesn't it fit?

30:40.180 --> 30:44.100
And you can think of this momentarily in a very simple supply and demand way,

30:46.740 --> 30:48.740
which is an element of the whole picture.

30:48.740 --> 30:51.220
It isn't the whole picture, but it is an element.

30:52.500 --> 30:56.180
Is the total amount of a certain grade of steel

30:58.260 --> 31:03.060
that is being demanded by all the enterprises for the work that they intend to carry out

31:03.780 --> 31:08.340
equal to the amount of steel that the steel industry is slated to produce?

31:10.180 --> 31:12.020
Has slated itself to produce.

31:12.020 --> 31:15.300
And if those two numbers don't match, then you have a coordination problem.

31:15.860 --> 31:20.740
And so we'll try to solve that problem by allocating additional resources to steel,

31:20.740 --> 31:29.380
by finding workarounds, or by scaling back the production plans of the other enterprises.

31:30.180 --> 31:36.180
And so it's a vast interconnected network that has to be rendered consistent.

31:36.980 --> 31:41.060
Now you can render it consistent in the abstract by solving a system of equations.

31:42.580 --> 31:43.940
There are millions of equations.

31:44.580 --> 31:48.500
And then we get into the old millions of equations critique of socialism.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.340
It's really a critique of central planet.

31:51.460 --> 31:54.740
The central planners just don't have the information

31:54.740 --> 31:56.660
and they don't have the technology to do it.

31:56.660 --> 31:57.140
They can't.

31:57.780 --> 31:58.500
It's too big.

32:01.300 --> 32:02.980
And so we have to let the market do it.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.020
That's the old binary.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.340
That's the old way of thinking.

32:07.380 --> 32:13.940
In the iterative way of thinking, the center sends modified plans back to the enterprise

32:13.940 --> 32:19.780
based upon the enterprise's original plans, but with certain modifications.

32:19.780 --> 32:24.100
Now the center's right to make those modifications is part of the conception.

32:24.820 --> 32:29.860
The enterprise, as I said, is not an autonomous, self-managing entity

32:31.300 --> 32:32.740
apart from any constraints.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.780
And it's an old philosophical debate.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.060
Does freedom boil down entirely to absence of constraint?

32:43.940 --> 32:46.900
And Marx and Engels wrote about this, Engels particularly,

32:46.900 --> 32:54.260
in an essay which was called On Authority and several other things that one could look at.

32:54.260 --> 32:55.300
That's really important.

32:57.380 --> 33:02.500
So the enterprise now has a modified plan, but along the lines of its original plan

33:02.500 --> 33:06.820
because it signals its intentions by sending that plan up.

33:07.620 --> 33:10.820
And so now, not having to start from fresh, from scratch,

33:11.460 --> 33:17.060
the enterprise can make the necessary modifications and send the information back up.

33:18.340 --> 33:23.780
Now in sending information up that way in each round or each iteration,

33:24.340 --> 33:26.180
it's a crucial concept in the whole model.

33:26.260 --> 33:34.980
So in each iteration, the enterprise sends information up to the top.

33:34.980 --> 33:41.060
The enterprise is revealing its actual potentials, its actual capacities to do things.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.780
And it is using its local knowledge.

33:44.660 --> 33:48.100
So here again, we get a concept from Hayek, right?

33:49.220 --> 33:52.740
And Hayek used the idea of local knowledge

33:53.220 --> 33:57.300
as a way of attacking the very concept of central planning.

34:00.020 --> 34:09.380
But the iterative conception is a stage by stage coordination of local wills and general wills.

34:10.020 --> 34:15.220
You know, the general interest of society is expressed in the central plan.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.700
That's a crucial idea in this.

34:17.940 --> 34:19.140
That's a crucial idea in this.

34:21.300 --> 34:25.700
And in principle, and I emphasize in principle,

34:25.700 --> 34:28.900
because there's where the reply from the libertarians could come.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.100
You know, what you can do in principle, you can't do in practice.

34:32.100 --> 34:32.820
But I'll say it.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.020
I'll say it in principle.

34:34.980 --> 34:39.700
If the enterprise is incentivized to do it, if the enterprise has the incentive,

34:40.260 --> 34:45.140
it can put its local resources and its local knowledge unknown to the center,

34:45.140 --> 34:51.460
its particularities into the process and therefore send back to the center

34:51.460 --> 34:59.540
in the form of its next round of proposals precise, accurate, detailed knowledge,

34:59.540 --> 35:01.780
not only of what exists at the local level,

35:01.780 --> 35:07.060
but what the local level thinks could potentially exist if it mobilizes its resources,

35:07.700 --> 35:14.260
if it mobilizes its collectives and sets itself an ambitious project

35:14.980 --> 35:18.020
for technical transformation.

35:18.020 --> 35:20.100
And then that goes back to the center.

35:20.100 --> 35:24.820
So the center keeps on getting corrected, better information.

35:25.940 --> 35:28.660
And on the basis of that, better information puts together

35:28.660 --> 35:33.300
one more iteration of a consistent plan and sends that back down.

35:35.140 --> 35:37.460
And the enterprise can then work with that.

35:38.020 --> 35:44.660
If each iteration results in a plan that's less different from the preceding one

35:44.660 --> 35:48.420
than the time before, so that the plan is progressively getting,

35:48.980 --> 35:54.420
in other words, what the enterprise gets back is more like what it said the last time.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.340
And the same at the level of the center.

35:56.340 --> 35:59.860
The center is constantly getting back from all the enterprises

36:01.220 --> 36:04.500
a picture which is closer and closer to consistency.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.860
Then the plan is said to be converging.

36:08.580 --> 36:11.940
And that's where the word convergence comes in.

36:11.940 --> 36:15.540
And work is being done and has done, it was done in the 20th century,

36:15.540 --> 36:26.100
mainly in the socialist countries, the countries where this was a practical matter,

36:26.100 --> 36:32.420
not just something that a few academics like me batted around, you know,

36:33.220 --> 36:36.340
but they were really working on this.

36:36.340 --> 36:39.300
The idea is how long will convergence take

36:39.300 --> 36:41.860
and how efficient can the convergence process be?

36:43.060 --> 36:45.540
So that if eventually you get convergence,

36:45.540 --> 36:49.460
what you get is a plan which is not merely a political compromise,

36:49.460 --> 36:54.260
as it's sometimes thought of in a mixed economy kind of a situation,

36:54.260 --> 36:58.340
but something that everyone will have been involved in producing.

36:59.140 --> 37:04.100
And there you have the potential to draw workers into the production process.

37:04.980 --> 37:13.140
In other words, you have people being drawn into planning, conceiving

37:16.020 --> 37:24.580
what our work is going to accomplish, you know, and jobs become not just jobs, you know.

37:25.380 --> 37:33.300
You get to a situation where qualitatively, the workplace experience is not just an experience

37:33.300 --> 37:37.860
of being an instrument of someone else's will for a period of time during the day,

37:37.860 --> 37:45.060
in exchange for which you receive wages, creating a separation between a production sphere

37:45.060 --> 37:47.700
and a consumption sphere, they're totally separate, you know,

37:47.700 --> 37:51.780
but you gradually get the meaningful integration of this.

37:51.780 --> 37:57.940
And that's a goal. Now, if you want to talk about something socialism is supposed to mean,

37:58.980 --> 38:03.940
it's supposed to mean that. It's supposed to mean that people actually begin to experience

38:04.980 --> 38:10.260
practically control over their own lives and theoretically in the sense that they're not just

38:10.820 --> 38:17.060
carrying out orders and so forth and fitting into a scheme of things,

38:17.060 --> 38:23.460
and fitting into a scheme of things, which everyone has to do. I mean, that's necessary

38:23.460 --> 38:28.100
if the whole system is going to work, but that they understand the way the scheme works

38:28.740 --> 38:36.100
and participate in making it happen. And I'll just say that my way of interpreting the great

38:36.100 --> 38:41.460
legacy of Marx and Engels, you know, and their followers, everyone else who has come along

38:42.420 --> 38:49.620
since then, is that they created a view of socialism, which was not that it's something

38:49.620 --> 38:57.460
that strikes in one moment in time, like a bolt from heaven. You know, socialism is not a

38:58.660 --> 39:08.180
miraculous occurrence, a kind of biblical event, but it's something that has to be built. You want

39:08.180 --> 39:13.780
to talk about the working class in power. You have to have people with sufficient education,

39:13.780 --> 39:21.860
sufficient political consciousness, sufficient fundamental human resources, people and their

39:21.860 --> 39:29.460
institutions. Okay. And so that's part of it. We'll get more in a moment into the actual

39:29.460 --> 39:37.940
organization of MDIC. Yeah. And we will definitely get also to the point that you just touched upon

39:38.020 --> 39:42.820
at the end, which would be somehow related to the question of transition and transformation,

39:42.820 --> 39:50.660
but we will kind of push it a little bit further to the end. Before we get there. I mean, there was

39:50.660 --> 39:57.620
a lot in there when you just described the basic outline of the model. And I would have a couple

39:57.620 --> 40:04.420
of questions actually that might serve as a follow-up. And I mean, one of the initial

40:04.420 --> 40:09.140
questions would be the starting point where you said, all right, we have this center, which will

40:09.140 --> 40:17.620
come up with a like first idea of a basic plan, which will, as you just pointed out, not be a

40:17.620 --> 40:25.940
detailed plan because the detailed planning will be what the enterprises are going to do. But what

40:25.940 --> 40:34.500
will be the basis of the, you spoke of a grand plan that the center provides in the first place?

40:34.500 --> 40:42.100
So what are the components that this plan is based upon? And yeah, maybe let's just leave it

40:42.100 --> 40:50.020
there. What's the basic starting point when it comes to that? Okay. It boils down to what is

40:50.020 --> 40:59.780
the center there for? What is the role of the center? And every question is a big question,

40:59.780 --> 41:09.620
but that's a big question. I'll try to be as brief as possible. The first point is we want to avoid

41:09.620 --> 41:19.700
another conceptual miscue that is often present in people's thinking about this. People associate

41:19.700 --> 41:25.540
democracy with the lower levels, the local levels. If you have people participating in planning,

41:25.540 --> 41:31.220
they're participating at their enterprise, at their workplace, for example. They're not

41:31.220 --> 41:36.980
participating over there. I would like to emphasize that what I'm calling the center

41:38.980 --> 41:46.500
is also a site for democratic participation. And I mean this in two different ways. Now,

41:46.500 --> 41:51.780
first of all, we have to be clear. If we're talking about a society with several hundred million

41:51.780 --> 41:58.420
people, a huge country, I mean, countries are different sizes or at least dozens of millions

42:00.180 --> 42:06.500
of people in a country of a reasonable size. We can't talk about everybody cramming into a

42:06.500 --> 42:13.940
room and participating in the decision by raising their hands and exercising a democratic voice in

42:13.940 --> 42:21.140
that direct democracy sense. We can't imagine a town meeting democracy on the level of a modern

42:21.140 --> 42:27.220
country. And no one is trying to do that. So government will be representative.

42:28.820 --> 42:35.060
And how representation is secured, whether by vote, whether by lottery,

42:36.180 --> 42:42.180
there is a proposal for doing it by lottery. I don't follow that line of thinking myself.

42:42.180 --> 42:46.340
I'm not convinced about that, but it's part of the debate, and it should be,

42:48.100 --> 42:51.940
is another question that would have to be worked out. But you have

42:55.300 --> 43:01.780
a system of democratic control in sort of formal sense. But I'm talking about more than that. I'm

43:01.780 --> 43:09.780
talking about a culture of critical democracy surrounding central planning. Now, modern

43:09.780 --> 43:16.660
technology plays a role in that. We have the internet. A central planning board doesn't have

43:16.660 --> 43:22.340
to be a distant place. It doesn't have to be somewhere far away in a capital city, which is

43:22.340 --> 43:29.300
thousands of miles from where I live, let's say, and where people do things that I have no control over.

43:32.100 --> 43:37.060
Needless to say, in the 20th century, in the socialist economies of the 20th century,

43:37.860 --> 43:43.860
there were quite a few instances of situations like that. It was a highly mixed

43:44.980 --> 43:53.780
sort of situation. But it's a process, just as I said before, in relation to

43:53.780 --> 44:00.660
worker participation. These things are processes, but it's also a process, the participation of the

44:00.660 --> 44:08.100
worker citizen in central planning, at the level of central planning, where a certain degree of

44:08.100 --> 44:13.940
openness of the process itself. In other words, the evolving plan doesn't have to be something,

44:15.540 --> 44:21.620
let's say, a certain stage of the central plan moving toward consistency along the path of

44:21.620 --> 44:26.900
convergence. You have a central plan. You don't have to wait until it's announced.

44:27.460 --> 44:32.260
You can read it on the internet. You can go on the central planning website

44:32.260 --> 44:37.380
and you can see what it is. And then there will be enormous critical commentary on that.

44:40.260 --> 44:45.060
I like to say we're talking about central planning within the sites of the bloggers

44:45.060 --> 44:53.060
and the cartoonists and the critical process in society as a whole. This would be part of the

44:53.060 --> 45:00.260
culture of central as well as de-central levels of planning so that

45:04.740 --> 45:09.380
quality has got to be part of our deliberations. Now, that having been said, what does the

45:09.380 --> 45:17.540
central planning do? Because I think what your question actually was, well, first of all, it

45:18.500 --> 45:26.260
achieves overall coordination, but that's just part of it. Beyond that, it organizes

45:26.260 --> 45:35.380
the discussion of planning as such. Now, you'll notice that I use the term

45:35.380 --> 45:40.660
multi-level democratic iterative coordination. I used the word coordination at the end of that

45:40.820 --> 45:48.020
little acronym, MDIC. I didn't call it multi-level democratic iterative planning,

45:48.580 --> 45:55.700
and I had a reason for that. I think the word planning has a connotation that ought to be

45:55.700 --> 46:03.620
preserved. It's planning for the future. It's forward-looking planning, and that is not just

46:03.620 --> 46:09.700
the problem of how do we put the puzzle together now, but how do we think about the way we

46:10.660 --> 46:17.620
want our society and eventually our societies, think of a global level, to evolve in the decades

46:17.620 --> 46:25.940
to come? Foremost there is the question of sustainability, the question of how do we want

46:25.940 --> 46:38.500
to evolve human activity in a way that enhances and protects the Earth's environment and the ultimate

46:38.500 --> 46:47.380
constraint, the limitation of planetary resources available to us. I won't talk about

46:47.380 --> 46:52.980
Star Trek and the Federation of Planets or anything. That's science fiction or speculative

46:52.980 --> 46:58.660
fiction, so we'll leave that for the future, but right now we're talking about planet Earth and

46:58.660 --> 47:06.660
its limited resources and so forth. A view to the future, a long time horizon, is very central to

47:06.660 --> 47:12.100
what a central planning element within the overall planning process, not central planning,

47:13.460 --> 47:20.980
but the central component within a dynamic iterative process. That is something that

47:20.980 --> 47:26.740
the central planning component can contribute, a sense of the long time horizon, of the need to

47:27.380 --> 47:33.940
protect the Earth from global warming and the need to protect the ozone layer. I can go on,

47:34.580 --> 47:41.380
but there's a huge literature on this and this aspect is very important. Those constraints

47:41.380 --> 47:47.220
involve studying the interaction among the activities of all of the economies and all

47:47.220 --> 47:51.860
of the local units of all of the economies together. In principle, this cannot be done

47:52.500 --> 47:58.580
at the local level. This is something that can't be, obviously people everywhere can have opinions

47:58.580 --> 48:03.700
on it and should have those opinions expressed and the critical deliberative process should be

48:03.700 --> 48:10.660
taking place. There's no question about that, but this is something that can only be worked into

48:10.660 --> 48:17.460
meaningful long-term plans, dynamic future-oriented plans at a level which coordinates,

48:18.820 --> 48:24.820
has a coordinating perspective for the overall, so that's one thing, major thing, that central

48:24.820 --> 48:31.780
planning can do. There's also something that's very hard, we need to do a lot of background

48:31.780 --> 48:36.100
on this and I'd need to do a lot of background for myself because I'm teaching it to myself

48:37.300 --> 48:44.740
over the years, but I want to say something very controversial about prices. There is a

48:44.740 --> 48:51.780
widespread idea that we can develop some kind of optimal prices, the best prices,

48:52.180 --> 49:00.580
but that if we do, what we will be doing is imitating what exists in a general equilibrium

49:00.580 --> 49:08.420
of competitive markets, that the market model is the model for what the price vector, that is

49:08.420 --> 49:14.900
the list of all the prices, ordered list in the economy, what that should look like, what the

49:14.900 --> 49:20.740
should look like, what the internal proportions in that list will be, is somehow

49:24.340 --> 49:32.260
planning something that is what a spontaneous market mechanism with either socialist or

49:32.260 --> 49:40.100
capitalist property relations regardless, a market mechanism unplanned would accomplish

49:40.820 --> 49:46.980
and I think that's wrong. I think there are socialist production prices, if you like,

49:49.300 --> 49:53.700
I call them social reproduction prices and work that I've done on this,

49:56.420 --> 49:57.700
which would incorporate

49:58.660 --> 50:07.460
actual quantitative calculations of price relations that are determined by social

50:09.460 --> 50:14.420
relations forces, things going on in the social relations of society, such as, for example,

50:14.420 --> 50:22.500
the ecological considerations, which no spontaneous mechanism involving interaction among

50:22.660 --> 50:30.660
uncoordinated entities, resulting in convergence towards some kind of equilibrium prices

50:30.660 --> 50:37.380
can possibly accomplish, it just can't do it. So one of the things a central planning board

50:38.340 --> 50:44.420
would be responsible for is the massive problem of calculating optimal prices for purposes of

50:44.500 --> 50:51.540
prices for purposes of calculation, income formation, decision making,

50:53.140 --> 50:56.740
and I'm taking the point of view and it's a controversial point of view in the socialist

50:56.740 --> 51:00.660
spectrum and some people say all of that is capitalist thinking, you shouldn't be thinking

51:00.660 --> 51:06.740
that way at all, that you shouldn't be thinking about, first of all, you shouldn't be thinking

51:06.740 --> 51:10.900
about optimality, you shouldn't be thinking about finding the best ways of doing anything

51:11.540 --> 51:18.340
that's foreign to socialist thinking, I don't believe that, I believe

51:19.780 --> 51:25.860
optimization in that sense is too important to be left to capitalist property owners,

51:25.860 --> 51:32.340
when the workers own the resources of society and are in charge of its legacy, are in charge of

51:32.900 --> 51:39.060
what we become, you know, that responsibility weighs heavily on the shoulders of people who

51:39.060 --> 51:45.940
have to actually make decisions and carry it out and they have to do it the best way that can be

51:45.940 --> 51:52.020
done in the name of all the people whose blood sweat and tears are congealed in all of those

51:52.020 --> 51:57.300
resources that we have, you know, and the futures and whose children and grandchildren depend upon

51:57.300 --> 52:06.100
upon that and that's a very important element of socialist leadership. So it's another thing that

52:06.100 --> 52:11.620
a central planning board would have to do. So finally, I'll just end with a very short one,

52:12.500 --> 52:20.580
a central planning board has got to address taking into account the entire background

52:20.580 --> 52:28.180
democratic debate and all the information that's flowing into them all of the more near-term issues

52:28.180 --> 52:33.460
about how society should develop, how should we arrange the relationship between production

52:33.460 --> 52:40.660
and residential spaces? You know, it's an old question, but clearly an obviously relevant one

52:40.660 --> 52:47.620
will continue to be, should we put factories and homes close together, save on commuting time,

52:48.660 --> 52:56.340
you know, but there are obvious environmental pollution issues, you know, should people have

52:56.340 --> 53:03.060
to live near sources of environmental pollution, noise pollution, environmental pollution, you know,

53:03.300 --> 53:11.300
particulates in the air, anything like that, you know, or should we separate production locations

53:11.300 --> 53:16.420
and residences, put them miles apart from one another, you know, then we can create nice

53:16.420 --> 53:22.500
residential enclaves which don't have to see the factories and the stores and the offices, you know,

53:22.500 --> 53:30.100
but we create enormous commuting problems, burdens on the transportation network. How do we work out

53:30.100 --> 53:38.660
consumption, production, residence, transportation, how do we get all these networks,

53:39.460 --> 53:44.980
water, power, you know, obviously the technology is improving and the trade-offs are getting better,

53:44.980 --> 53:52.580
you know, over time, unless ecological problems, you know, tightening environmental constraints

53:52.580 --> 53:57.220
are working in the opposite direction, but all of this has to be put together and it has to be

53:57.220 --> 54:04.180
thought through and has to be eventually transmitted into viable five-year, ten-year,

54:04.180 --> 54:11.540
fifteen-year, thirty-year plans, you know, which reflect the formation of a democratic consensus,

54:11.540 --> 54:16.820
they reflect the best that technology can give us and they reflect the overall balance of resources

54:16.820 --> 54:24.180
and these are problems that can't be solved at a local level. The local level participates in them,

54:24.180 --> 54:31.380
but the local level can't, you can't have 10 million separate plans to address

54:31.380 --> 54:36.180
the problem of human interaction with the environment over the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years,

54:36.180 --> 54:43.140
can't happen. That's the central component and some of the things which it has to do.

54:44.500 --> 54:53.460
Let's try to pick this apart a little bit at least because oftentimes when, also when reading

54:53.460 --> 54:58.820
a text and now when hearing your elaborations, I mostly agree with the overall sentiment,

54:58.820 --> 55:04.820
but there are like huge question marks in terms of how can this be done? So, when it comes to

55:04.820 --> 55:12.900
the question of what kind of information would the center need to have in order to be able to

55:12.900 --> 55:19.220
make these decisions that you think the center should do and which I would largely agree with

55:19.220 --> 55:25.860
that this would be a problem of collective problem solving and not only a domestic one

55:25.860 --> 55:32.820
because certain topics cannot be addressed as you clearly pointed out on a decentralized level alone,

55:33.460 --> 55:40.500
but what is the flow of information? So, I need to come back to this question. If you state that

55:41.460 --> 55:47.940
the center, for example, will have to calculate, I think they are called price lists, which include

55:47.940 --> 55:55.940
social reproduction prices for broad categories of goods as I understand it, then what would be

55:55.940 --> 56:03.220
the informational basis on top of which this would be calculated and you also explained that it would

56:03.220 --> 56:09.460
not only be a parametric part which needs to be considered, but also a very social one that needs

56:09.460 --> 56:15.860
to be considered and it needs to flow into these forms of calculation done by the center, but I

56:15.860 --> 56:22.740
think it is of crucial importance first to ask, okay, what's the information, the exact information

56:22.740 --> 56:31.300
that flows into it? If you do not have, for example, prices for consumer goods or something

56:31.300 --> 56:39.860
like that that will serve as an indicator, for example, and then how would a meaningful

56:39.860 --> 56:50.340
participation of the enterprises as well as the rest of society, how can this be facilitated in

56:50.340 --> 56:58.100
order to not end up in a situation where the people that receive these quote unquote directions

56:58.100 --> 57:06.580
from the center do not perceive it as external to themselves, but do like legitimately feel it

57:06.660 --> 57:12.420
as something that they took part in creating. I mean, this is a very crucial element and I think

57:12.420 --> 57:20.420
it's something that you are very much interested in that people will be able to participate in this

57:20.420 --> 57:28.820
forming of plans, but you will have this kind of difficult question to answer how it can be done

57:28.820 --> 57:35.380
that it is not like too many meetings problem, as you just stated, it's not possible to have like

57:35.380 --> 57:43.140
20 million people deciding on this, but still have people left with a reasonable

57:45.220 --> 57:53.300
way to take part in this overall coordination. So how do you approach this kind of difficult problem,

57:53.300 --> 58:02.260
I guess? Well, I think you're asking me a question which can only be answered

58:02.820 --> 58:08.180
historically, it can only be answered by the process of history unfolding itself. I think

58:09.220 --> 58:14.660
you're asking the kind of the working question, which isn't going to have a simple answer with

58:14.660 --> 58:25.620
the capital A, it's to an ordinary, we always use this word ordinary, but a rank and file

58:26.580 --> 58:30.980
socialist and socially conscious and socialist educated working person

58:32.100 --> 58:38.900
in an enterprise, a price list is announced and is available on the internet,

58:40.660 --> 58:52.020
which is a very big now in price theory, you discover and there was a lot of work done

58:52.580 --> 59:01.700
in the Soviet Union and other eastern countries about this. If the price list is a sort of a core

59:01.700 --> 59:11.300
than an enterprise can apply for variations based upon detailed things. My general point is that

59:13.460 --> 59:18.180
the person working in an enterprise can say, okay, these are the prices we have to work with,

59:18.180 --> 59:24.340
we just take them, we take them parametrically, we just say these are the prices and we don't

59:24.340 --> 59:29.220
need to be concerned with how they were constructed, but they don't have to do that,

59:31.460 --> 59:38.020
they can understand the theory behind it, they can understand something. Now, there's obviously

59:38.020 --> 59:45.300
on different levels, I'm not necessarily assuming that every worker in a production

59:45.540 --> 59:53.700
plant at an enterprise is going to be able to independently solve the matrix equations,

59:53.700 --> 01:00:01.220
which result in the formation of a certain set of optimal prices, but they will have come up

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:09.780
through the education system and the ongoing education system, the process of political and

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.660
political economic education that's part of being in a socialist enterprise, it's part of existence

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:24.180
in that enterprise, they will acquire some sense of the underlying principles and they will know

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:31.540
something about that and they will have read the equivalent of popular science articles,

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:41.540
which explain and transmit as much of this. One of the goals in this integration of planning and

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:53.300
execution as two phases of human activity, really, is to break down those barriers, to

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.820
to create the greatest possibility for rational understanding,

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:05.860
as the sociologist Mannheim, Karl Mannheim, would have said years ago,

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.300
rational understanding rather than merely functional understanding. Now,

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.300
we have functional understanding of a lot of things, I personally have only functional

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.820
understanding of this computer that I'm talking to you on and what you do to move around on it,

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:31.940
I wish I were more of a techie, but I'm not, and we struggle with that, but in all fair

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:37.060
phases of life, we want to understand and especially when it comes not to the technical

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:42.740
things, where we understand that better, but when it comes to the social side, when it comes to

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:49.540
actually knowing how human relations are managed and that we're part of that,

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:56.740
you know, we aren't just recipients of it, we have a role to play in grasping it

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.740
theoretically, not just practically. But beyond that, it's hard to say,

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.420
you know, it would depend on and it will be very different in different places and times,

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:13.300
you know, different, I don't think there's a simple formula that can answer that one,

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:20.260
it has to be answered practically. And I mean, quite a huge part of this relation,

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:27.380
specifically when it comes to enterprises and the center, is the question of,

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:35.380
I think you posed it as the question of incentives before, I mean, because at some point,

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:42.100
the question comes into mind that you have this iterative process and the center sends some

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:48.100
initial prices for broad categories and then you have the detailed planning by the enterprises

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:55.540
and the enterprises then are expected to submit truthful information. So, I mean, as we know,

01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:00.820
this was a problem in the Soviet Union, so this was not truthful information because we had the

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:08.900
perverse incentive problem, so to speak, where the enterprises did have a incentive to kind of

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:15.860
hoard stuff because they knew that they would get like way too hard goals to manage and so they

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:22.500
were hoarding, et cetera, et cetera. So, you will have in this iterative process, the question of

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:27.620
what's the incentive for the enterprises to give back truthful information in order to make the

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:32.820
whole thing work because if they do not, then it kind of implodes, so to speak, because it won't

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:39.060
work and related to that is the question of what will be the reward for the given enterprise.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:48.100
So, I think there's a, I think you call it, let me take a look, socialist rate of return

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:54.180
and as far as I understood it, this would be a kind of rate at which

01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:01.300
enterprises would be allowed to profit, quote unquote, from the whole thing. Maybe I got that

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:09.860
wrong, but I would be interested in this constellation. How do the given enterprises,

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:20.660
how are they incentivized to do as they are told, quote unquote, plus being semi-autonomous in

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:30.740
being effective in actually producing the stuff and not wasting resources and then truthfully

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:37.540
reporting back and taking part in the iterative process? So, what's the gist to all of that?

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.660
Because it needs to be a collaboration and not an opposition.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:48.260
Well, wow. These are questions which could take a long time to answer and I want to try to...

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:54.020
But they're central, I guess. I mean, for me, it's absolutely central to understand the model.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.580
I'm sorry if it's too...

01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:04.740
One thing, no, don't be sorry. Very good. One thing, I'll break it into two parts. I'm trying

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:09.860
to figure out which part to do first. I'm going to do the reverse order. I want to take the

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:17.700
incentive. That's part of your question, which is very good. So, you have this iterative process

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.340
and we're somehow assuming that the enterprise is going to get together and is going to make

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:30.260
truthful reports of the resources it controls and is not going to manipulate the process for

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:35.300
its own strategic purposes. I think that's key and there was a huge literature in the Soviet Union

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:41.620
about deformations that resulted from exactly that kind of behavior, which is exactly what you'd

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:49.700
expect at the stage of development that existed there. Then you'd hardly, from a serious materialist

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:55.620
point of view, expect anything else to happen. You had people... How did Marx put it? He says,

01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:01.460
society only come into existence stamped with the birthmarks of the society from which they emerge.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:12.100
This is a process. We understand that. So, how do we address strategic distorting behavior on the

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:21.700
part of local entities, enterprises or whatever? First, I want to mention there's a whole literature

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:30.420
on that, which I believe was in some ways stimulated by the economic reform in the

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:37.300
Soviet Union. Back in the 1960s, the Lieberman reforms, as they're called in the West, which

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:43.540
essentially amounted to setting up something like at least an early stage of an iterative process

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:52.100
that MDIC focuses on, where the enterprises were told, we will no longer be sending you detailed

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:58.580
plans. We will be sending you a few overall control figures. Within that, you need to work out

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:05.300
the detailed plans. You need to do a complete accounting for your resources and

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:11.860
a specification of how you're going to change methods of production and what you're going to

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:18.740
do. Was that successful or unsuccessful? It's a long, complicated story. I want to skip over it,

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:29.860
but it gave rise to the incentive design literature, which a number of European scholars...

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.820
There was a large French component, an economist by the name of Tirol,

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:44.820
and a number of Americans also participated in that. How can you devise truth-telling

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:57.220
incentive mechanisms? Essentially, I have an answer. I'm not going to try to

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:02.260
elaborate it too much, because we don't even have visuals. We only have sound,

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.940
and even to the extent that I understand it, which is that I've been able to take it.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:18.420
I think in the usual thinking about this, there's another binary, another one of these

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:24.420
either-or kind of situations. In this case, the either-or is that people say,

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:33.540
some mathematical economists say, either you assume that people are socially motivated and

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:44.740
have high moral values and will simply act in the public interest because that's the kind of people

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.660
they are. You assume glorious people out of whom you will build a glorious society, or you have

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:58.900
to give up. Those are the two alternatives. The only kind of incentives you can possibly

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:03.700
have that make sense are market incentives where people are actually made to suffer for bad

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:09.700
decisions. If we don't produce efficiently, the business will go out of existence and the workers

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:17.060
will be fired and so forth and so on. That's control. You can't do it anyway. You can't provide

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:23.540
people with an incentive to act in the social interest. You don't have to provide them with

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:30.180
an incentive to act in their personal interest. That's human nature. They'll do that by themselves.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:37.940
Is there an answer to that? I believe there is, and it resides in something I call,

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.860
that's a complicated phrase, but I'll give it to you because then I'll be able to refer to it.

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:53.940
The collective morale function. Let me set an environment to explain this. There's an enterprise

01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:01.860
and the enterprise is required to form a plan. The enterprise personnel sit around a table,

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:06.260
the enterprise director and some of his technical people and some other people,

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:10.420
representatives of each of the departments of the enterprise, some kind of a little group that,

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:18.900
as best as possible under now given circumstances, represents the enterprise. What should we do?

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.700
The enterprise, I'll just use a term, say the enterprise director

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.940
has a problem. Let's say he's in charge of this meeting. He sets the agenda.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:49.220
He or she can set a target and say, this is what we're going to achieve. I'll put a number on it,

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:55.940
a target of 100. We're going to set a target of 100. The question is, is that the best the enterprise

01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:03.460
can do? In order to find that out, this director is going to have to consult the people in the

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.980
enterprise. He's going to have to say, okay, people, do you want to roll up your sleeves

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:13.460
and really get to work? Do we want to really make a run at transforming ourselves into something a

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:19.940
little bit different from what we've been and really improve the way we work? This can mean

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:25.540
the level of output. It can mean many other things as well. I'll get to that part. That's

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:32.500
the second part. Are we really going to do this? Are we going to push ourselves to the practical

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:44.340
limit? If we do, then let's say that's 100. Now, if we do a little less than that, it's 95, 96.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:50.180
If we do more, it's 103, 104, 105, that kind of thing. That's an index number

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:58.900
that we can use to measure our level of performance. Now, here's the collective

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:06.820
morale function. It says that when you have an enterprise in a society that is technologically

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:14.660
and educationally and socialistically advanced, we have a society of very intelligent, committed,

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:21.780
working people. We are not talking about people who trudge unwillingly into work every morning

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:27.300
and do what they're told, take a list from their supervisor, pay you to do this, this, and this,

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:34.180
and you carry out those tasks, go home, buy groceries with your wages, and come back the

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:41.220
next day. We're beyond that. We have a society where in order to achieve something, you really

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:48.260
have to have people motivated to do it. People really have to be involved. You have to bring

01:12:48.260 --> 01:13:01.060
your teams on board, so to speak. Now, suppose the enterprise director is a very ambitious person

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:06.420
and wants to make a real good impression on his or her superiors,

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:15.780
and says, the information coming from all my colleagues is that our best level of achievement

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:27.060
is 100. I'm going to push for 103. Let's see if we can get it up to 103. This is the kind of person

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:36.260
who's really a rouser, a very, very high taught planning kind of a person, a person who is going

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:44.820
to try to push the enterprise. Let's suppose the actual effect of that has a demoralizing component

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:51.940
to it. Let's suppose people are going to sigh and say, okay, well, I guess we can put in some overtime

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.420
and I guess we can rework all these procedures that we have and I guess we can recalculate

01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:03.220
everything. We can go over everything, but it's really impinging on other areas of life

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:08.740
for your staff, for the people around you. It's tough. This is not an easy thing to do.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:15.700
What the collective morale function says is that as a result of pushing beyond 100

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:23.060
and calling for 103, what you'll only get is 102. In other words, you'll get people to do a little

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:31.300
more, but various forms of conscious and even unconscious resistance will develop.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:38.420
What you will get, I need you to imagine a sort of a line. I realize I can't put anything on a

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:47.460
chalkboard. A horizontal line at a level of 100 and then a curve which touches that line at 100.

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:53.140
It's below the line. It touches at 100 and falls off in either direction. It's like a

01:14:53.140 --> 01:15:02.100
downward-facing parabola. It just rises to 100 at a certain point at 100 and then falls off.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:11.220
You see? If you push too far in the upward direction, you will get an increase,

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:18.740
but you won't get the increase you push for. Similarly, and this is where the other side is,

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.940
suppose you get an enterprise director who wants to game the system and wants to go for less than

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:32.740
100. This is the concealing reserves case, which was talked about in the old Soviet literature,

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:41.460
where an enterprise director would have an incentive to try to achieve a plan which is

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:49.620
less than 100. In the iterative MDIC context, he would want to announce a plan less than 100

01:15:49.620 --> 01:16:00.980
and wants to announce a plan of 97, let's say. Once again, what's going to happen is that

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:07.220
that is also going to be demoralizing because people are saying, this enterprise director

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:15.620
is not asking us to do what we really can do, as much as we really can do. This enterprise director

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:22.420
is asking us to do less than that. Maybe we'll take a cue from that and we'll just cut back a

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:34.100
little bit more. Instead of 97, you would get 96. Again, part of the collective morale function.

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:39.940
In other words, the central idea is that under modern conditions,

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:55.380
moral matters. For morale to be invoked, for a collective to achieve a certain high level of

01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:04.500
functioning in its own terms, it has to know that it's doing the best it can do. But the best

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:09.380
doesn't mean the most. It doesn't mean the farthest out along that line, as we can possibly go. What

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:18.900
we need to do is we need to get it... In other words, the point of a collective morale function,

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:26.100
if it exists, is that the actual need to motivate your collective, the actual need to put people

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:33.780
into motion, to make things happen well, and to get people to reveal their own reserves and to

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:41.700
come forward with suggestions and interventions and activities. The way to accomplish that is

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:51.380
to be truthful. And if you're not truthful, the forces around you will undermine you

01:17:53.060 --> 01:18:02.180
to some degree. Now that idea, if it's true, if I can justify it,

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.260
and if anybody ever pays any attention to it, there will be many attacks against it,

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:15.380
it'll be contested. And in a certain sense, from my point of view, it should be, because if it isn't

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:27.140
solid, it won't hold, is the essential guarantee of the MDIC system. In other words, the center

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:33.860
can count on the enterprise to do approximately the best it can and therefore to send good

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:42.020
information up and enhance its contribution to the overall planning process. Because if it doesn't do

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:52.020
that, its own moral energy will be sacked, its own moral energy will be undermined.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:19:03.300
And to the extent that that's true, it's not, many people may interpret this as

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:12.260
saying that you're relying on the goodwill or the high moral fiber of individuals,

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:19.860
the way the old critique of decentralized planning had it. But I don't think that's what I'm doing.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:25.460
I hope that's not what I'm doing. I hope what I'm saying is that the enterprise, which means the

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:29.220
people themselves, I speak of the director, but he's speaking for everybody knows this,

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:35.700
everybody sitting around that table knows what the situation is. If we don't work ourselves to

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:41.780
our reasonable best level, and if we don't participate in the planning process in a

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:50.180
principled way, not in a strategic undermining way, then we're not going to feel good about

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.540
ourselves. And if we don't feel good about ourselves, we won't do the work that we need

01:19:53.540 --> 01:20:00.980
to do. We will be undermining our own work. Here it is in a single folksy expression,

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:06.900
the last thing I'll say, okay, get another question from you. If it's worth doing,

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:14.420
it's worth doing well. And you hear workers say that. There are even writers who talk about the

01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:21.940
invisible heart. That term has been used in a number of different ways. But my point is that

01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:29.140
the ultimate blue, which holds so-called market system together, is that there's an underlying

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:36.900
moral foundation to incentives, which can't be gotten away from. And I'm relying on it here as

01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:49.060
well. Well, I mean, I would say it's based on a lot of assumptions for sure. But it's based on

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:55.220
assumptions that I personally kind of favor, I would say, because at the end, it's not about

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:04.580
like relatively dumb economic incentivation, which I always think of not really holding up.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:13.860
Because if I look at myself, for example, I always found being forced to earn money for living

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:21.060
is like one of the biggest obstacles for me in trying to pursue things that I'm good at,

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:27.780
actually. So I personally like this approach, that it's not so much about economic incentives.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:34.820
I'm not so sure about the morality part, to be honest. But I think it refers back to

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:46.740
the question of how autonomous the enterprises are actually, how autonomous they can feel in terms of

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:52.180
the, I have to use the phrase, self-management of the enterprise. I mean, at the beginning of

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:59.860
our conversation, you refer to it as something that is not a given within your model. And I

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:06.900
would say we do come back to this right now, because it's part of the question of incentivation

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:16.660
that is not based on economic incentivation. How much do I legitimately feel involved in the way

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:24.740
the given enterprise is being run on the level of the enterprise? And then how much do I legitimately

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:35.780
feel being involved in the overall plan that gives me the like broad categories, broad directions of

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:43.140
what I am supposed to do. So I would say that given this constellation that you just described,

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:51.540
the question of, at least the perception of some form of autonomy within the workplace

01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:59.460
comes back into the picture as a form of motivation. So this is something that I might add at this

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:06.100
point. And then I wanted to ask something, because I, when trying to picture your model,

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:15.940
never really got to the point of understanding it correctly because I will just say it as directly

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:26.180
as I can, but is there profit? Does a given enterprise have the possibility to, for example,

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:34.260
pay a higher remuneration depending on how good they have done their job? I'll be as stupidly

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:41.620
obvious and blunt about it as I can. Is there something, it doesn't have to be like money,

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:48.420
it can also be like more leisure time or anything as such. Because if there would be something like

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:54.500
that, some form of indirect economic incentive, then it would really, really, really alter the

01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:00.980
whole picture, I would say. And it would also alter the picture in terms of if there is some

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:07.860
form of competition between the enterprises. So this would introduce a very different level

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:13.300
to the whole thing. So maybe you can help me kind of get a better picture of the whole thing.

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:21.620
Wow, we're covering everything in one session. This is amazing. We have to have a whole course.

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:29.700
It's good. I don't know whether I could, even this question, I'm trying, I didn't take notes,

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:35.780
I'm trying to remember everything. But yeah, okay. One aspect of your question is the,

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:45.940
you speak of profit. Now, let's assume for our discussion that we don't mean capitalist profit,

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.740
we don't mean surplus value extracted, you know, anything like that. But we're talking

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:58.580
about a socialist enterprise. The enterprise is owned by the workers of the country as a whole,

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:05.060
let's say. But it's also the workers who are actually at the enterprise and participate in

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:12.340
it have a major role, you know, and their interests have to be represented. One aspect of

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:24.100
your question is differentiation of income. Should people be rewarded for more product or for better

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:29.460
work? You know, should people be rewarded? So we can boil that down to saying,

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:35.780
start by asking the larger question, should the enterprise be rewarded? Should there be a stream

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:41.140
of income to the enterprise? We can even call it profit as long as we understand that the word

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:46.180
profit is one of those tricky words that means different things in different contexts. We know

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:54.500
that. So we'll just use it. Should the enterprise receive a profit based upon an evaluation of its

01:25:54.500 --> 01:26:00.980
work? So first of all, the question is, how do you evaluate enterprise performance? How do you measure

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:08.100
it? How do you measure how well or how poorly an enterprise is doing? And the second question is,

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:16.020
once we have that thing, once we have that reward, I mean, sorry, let me start this sentence again,

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:21.940
once we have that measure of enterprise performance, so I can say of this particular

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:27.140
enterprise, and it can say of itself, well, we did this well, or not so well, or whatever,

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:33.300
you know, whatever level it is. Now based on that, and the reward we receive as a result,

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:40.340
how should that reward be differentiated and broken up into the rewards of individual members

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:46.340
of the enterprise? How should it be reflected in individual wages? And how should those,

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:54.740
what I'll use the standard term for them, material incentives be harmonized with or related to

01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:02.180
moral incentives, the kinds of incentives that are given in the form of collective appreciation,

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:11.940
you know, trophies, banners, but not in a simplistic, cynical sense, but things that might

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:18.660
could at least be meaningful, they could at least have meaning for people. So come back to

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:26.020
the first question, how do we measure what an enterprise does? In the old days, earliest

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:30.900
experiments in socialist planning, of course, it was simple, the more the better. You know,

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:37.220
how did you measure the output of the work of a steel mill? How much steel it produced,

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:43.540
you know, millions of tons of steel, that was the measure, you know, and any other industry

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:51.220
the same way. Clearly, that's not sufficient. You have to measure not only what is being done,

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:56.340
but how efficiently it's being done, whether targets are being met for variety of output

01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:02.900
and for quality of output, many different things. All of that boils down into a single measure,

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:09.940
a rate of return. Okay. Now, it's not a rate of return in a sense of a property income to

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:16.020
ownership of the means of production. The society as a whole indivisibly owns the means of production.

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:22.420
This is not a market socialist model. The enterprise does not own its own means of production.

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:26.980
But we're talking about a rate of return in a sense that enables us to evaluate how well

01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:33.620
are the resources entrusted to us being used? And that's important, as I said before, you know,

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:38.740
that's something that socialists need to be concerned with. And you need to convince

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:45.540
the workers that we will, that we presume to lead in political struggles and eventually

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:52.180
revolutionary struggles, you know, that we will do that. You know, people understand that.

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.900
People say, we don't want clowns running the society who don't care about the resources that

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:05.460
represent generations of our effort and our collective labor, you know, to have created

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:10.820
these things. We want these things to be well managed. And that means being concerned with

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:25.220
rates of return. So what kind of rate of return? Well, not the capitalist one. Capitalist rate of

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:32.580
return is profits divided by capital. Right? Socialist rate of return, and this is an argument

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:37.220
I'm taking from a whole literature around what used to be called full income prices,

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.820
is not profit, but the entire net income.

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:48.340
In other words, wages plus profit divided by the value of means of production.

01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:56.500
I won't use the word capital in this context. So that in standard macroeconomic notation,

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:02.420
it would be Y over K, not P over K. It's not profit divided by K as a symbol for the means

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:09.460
of production, for the value of that, the resources being deployed to create this result.

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:15.860
But the entire income, the wages, in other words, what in conventional capitalist accounting are

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:24.900
wages and profits, all of that is returns to us as a whole, whether individually or collectively,

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:31.060
doesn't matter. So that's one thing about what rate of return do we use. And that rate of return,

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:37.380
if you analyze it, think about it, has all sorts of efficiencies taken care of within it. It's like

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:44.740
an aggregation of attending to levels of productivity, saving of raw materials,

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:50.260
efficient technical changes, which use the capital stocks in the most efficient way,

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:56.340
never mind what the details of that. But all of those kinds of decisions,

01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:01.140
if taken properly, would result in a higher rate of return.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:06.900
So that's one. Let me just very quickly, then I'll get back, continue with another question.

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:14.260
The other half of it is that in a socialist context, the measure of enterprise performance

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:21.940
can very well have a whole additional component to it, something totally different. And this would

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:30.580
be a component that's based upon ratings of the enterprise by stakeholders. And here I'm adopting

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:37.060
some of the thinking of Pat Devine, whom you've interviewed, you've had him present his ideas

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:43.380
directly. But I think that's a contribution to this. Stakeholders, which can be the workers

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:50.820
in the enterprise, but they can also be the surrounding community of the enterprise. They

01:31:50.820 --> 01:32:04.260
can be people who are interested in and qualified to examine the enterprise's work in relation to

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:09.860
ecology goals, sustainability and so forth, and emissions and so forth.

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:16.420
Industry representatives, people who vote essentially on how well the enterprise

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:21.780
relates to other enterprises in the industry. Soviet Union, for example, they used to have

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:28.020
programs where an advanced enterprise would take a lagging enterprise under its wing

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:36.500
and form mentorship relationships, where they would work on the technical skills of the workers

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:42.500
in the lagging enterprise and try to eliminate deficiencies. And finally, very importantly,

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:47.700
I would say, this is a socialist society and we're interested in building a solidary and

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:55.140
working class. We're interested in overcoming all existing vestiges of racism, misogyny,

01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:04.820
exclusive nationalism, nationalisms, all of these perverse ideologies that keep us from

01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:09.140
unifying fully and developing our potential. How well is the enterprise addressing that?

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:14.580
How well is the enterprise addressing gender relations within the plant and helping to

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:22.420
address problems there and advance equality in that sense?

01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:32.340
And all of those things, those various evaluations would be supplied to a component of the formula.

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:36.980
In other words, it would just be good things to do, but this would be how you actually

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:42.580
put it right into the formula, which determines the measure of enterprise

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:47.300
performance, which in turn determines the reward that the enterprise receives.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:55.700
Okay, so there would be the possibility of a reward in terms of

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:08.180
money, so to speak, depending on basic performance and social indicators, I think you call that.

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.420
Not money as such, but money as representing real income, real purchasing power,

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:19.220
a material incentive. Yeah, but there is money in your model, isn't it?

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:28.580
Well, yes, in the sense that it's implicit, it's being assumed. I don't build equations involving

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:37.140
a quantity of money. I don't worry about the velocity of circulation or issues in monetary

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:47.300
theory, but yes, I am assuming that for a reasonable period of time in an early stage

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:58.180
of development of mature socialism or MDIC socialism, some form of monetary unit would

01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:04.660
be used as monetary units were used in the planned economies of Eastern Europe and the

01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:12.500
Soviet Union, or we could speak of the currencies in place in capitalist countries since today.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.420
Here, there's a lot of confusion on the left. I think a lot of people on the left go immediately

01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:23.780
to a very utopian view. We should abolish money. I think what you want to abolish is what social

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:29.140
relations get carried in monetary form in a capitalist society, and not necessarily even

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:35.860
abolish those, but eliminate them as the possibility arises. It's one thing to say,

01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:42.020
we're going to abolish something. It is stroke. It's another thing to say, we've reached a level

01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:47.700
of development where this can now be attenuated or these aspects of money can wither away.

01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:53.140
But Marx was very clear on this. He said, money is one of the last forms of coercion.

01:35:54.100 --> 01:36:00.340
You know, and in order to eliminate it, development through a lower phase of communism

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:10.500
is necessary before that ultimate coercion of human beings by other human beings in the sense

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:16.180
of their circumstances surrounding them, like a monetary constraint on consumption, the connection

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:24.340
between labor and income. You know, you can say, let's just get rid of it right now. Let's just

01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:30.260
throw it away. But if the foundations have not been laid for that, if the prerequisites have

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:36.580
not been established, the results could be disastrous. And we'll take you farther away

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:42.260
from the goal of reaching a society where those constraints on human activity, including labor,

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:49.700
would no longer be binding constraints, increasingly wither away, become attenuated.

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:58.820
We will get there, I guess, in more or less one of the last questions, which will be on transition.

01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:04.420
But before that, I would very much be interested in your opinion on markets, because I think you

01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:11.220
have a distinction or not, I think, but I know you have a distinction between a core sector

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:17.380
and something that you call, I think, the informal sector. And I never really got my head around

01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:23.540
that. And it really reminded me of the, I think, the Chinese dual track system, the experiments

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:30.180
around that, because I had a very interesting guest on Isabella M. Weber, who wrote about how

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:38.900
China escaped shock therapy. And how they did it was through forms of cautious experimentation

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:44.420
with something they called the dual track system. And I felt very much reminded of these

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:51.380
experiments when I read about this distinction between a core sector and a sector that is

01:37:52.180 --> 01:38:01.460
forming around that within your model, which will, at least it sounded to me, Bill, will be

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:10.980
some form of mild market socialism-like sector. But I think you would disagree with that. But I

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.380
would certainly be interested in your opinion. Maybe you could explain to us what the core

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:19.380
sector is, and what the informal sector is, and how both relate to markets.

01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:28.100
Okay. Well, the core sector is the MDIC economy, you know, multi-level democratic

01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:38.820
iterative coordination. And it's not a market economy, you know. Prices are planned. Now they

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:44.740
may be planned with lots of local input, but they are eventually centrally planned. The central

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:56.020
component within MDIC is constantly forming and perfecting a system of prices which takes

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:05.780
regular account of the natural environment, the future, the actual social nature of the

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:15.940
productive resources which shape rates of return. It's hard to explain without presuming some

01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:22.580
economics, you know, in the audience. And here we have no presumptions. We have a whole

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:29.780
varied audience of people listening. But the connection between profit rates and prices,

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:35.540
you know, and the whole price structure depends intimately upon that. And the idea that

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:42.340
a general rate of return needs to form, which also I believe is true of an MDIC economy. But

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:51.060
I'm digressing. Let me try to stick onto your question. That's the MDIC economy. It is not a

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:59.940
market economy. So it's not a model of market socialism. And neither is it simply a state

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:08.740
central planned economy. This is important because in the non-socialist literature and

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:15.620
anti-socialist literature, socialism and state enterprise are equated. They practically mean

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:20.100
the same thing, you know, that when you talk about socialism, what you mean is the government will

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:25.060
make all the decisions and will decide everything. And we're not talking about government. To have an

01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:34.900
MDIC economy, it would have to be within what you could call the state sector. It is governmental,

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:42.340
but governmental itself does not define it. There would be plenty of state enterprises

01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:46.980
that are not part of the multi-level democratic iterative coordination system. It's a real

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:59.460
discipline. You have to be part of an everlasting, always existing, a continual, a system of

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:04.660
iterative coordination, a system of up-down and not just talking to each other all the time,

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:13.940
but regular stages of perfection of plans, which are to be implemented in the near future,

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:19.460
just while you are already implementing the existing ones. Implementation and planning are

01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:25.860
interrelated and continual processes. People are at different stages of both

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:39.860
at all times. That's the multi-level planning system, and it has a distinct and necessary

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:46.180
central component to it, unlike models like Robin Hanel's and Mike Albert's paracon,

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:53.620
participatory economy, which says the central has got to be excluded because it's the source of

01:41:55.620 --> 01:42:00.020
necessary, unavoidable evils, so we've got to have an entirely decentralized system.

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:07.380
There are many other variations on the model which could be described.

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:13.060
Now, the informal sector,

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:23.220
well, on the one hand, it doesn't really play a role in the model of the MDIC system. You can

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:29.540
form that model and you can think abstractly of a socialist economy which functions that way,

01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:35.860
which functions as a multi-level democratic iterative coordination system. In the real world,

01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:45.380
well, every example of a society that we know of, from the Asian countries, China, Vietnam,

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:52.660
to the Eastern European ones from earlier, they've gone in a different direction now,

01:42:52.660 --> 01:43:01.220
now, temporarily, I hope, and the Soviet Union no longer exists. You have examples of societies,

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:09.460
even the society, and Cuba, even the socialist economies that have existed in real historical

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:22.100
situations, even the ones that have been the most pure, non-informal, have had huge informal sectors.

01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:28.020
The Soviet Union had the collective farm sector. It had a kind of an informal services

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:31.460
sector because they always had difficulty integrating services into the planning

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:40.500
mechanism, so people used their skills to fill in the vacuums. The Soviet economy,

01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:50.180
annoyingly, did not solve the problem of repair services for material goods that they were

01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:58.580
producing. You could buy a TV by the late 1950s, 60s, but you couldn't get it repaired,

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:04.020
or most annoyingly, washing machine, so people with those skills, with the necessary skills,

01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:17.620
set themselves up as informal suppliers of these services, and that was part of their informal

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:25.060
economy. There were others, as well, that one could go into, but of course, you're going to

01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:31.540
have that. That's going to be part of the real-life process. The crucial thing is that

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.020
just because you're in the public sector doesn't mean you're in the core economy.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:44.180
I regard the public sector also, if it's a traditional public sector, as may have existed

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:52.100
centuries earlier, or even millennia earlier, that doesn't make you socialist. It becomes socialist

01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:59.940
when the democratic planning process becomes established. That happens by stages. It doesn't

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:12.740
happen all at once. This perfectly leads to the question of transition, because the whole

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:22.020
model, as I understood it, as I read it, with all these elements that I sometimes intuitively

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:28.100
would kind of tend to want to reject, but I absolutely understand that the whole model

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:37.700
is formed around an idea of process, and that we need to actually keep in mind the imperfections

01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:46.100
and hybridity of actually existing conditions as we find them and as we are living within them.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:55.620
I would be interested, maybe you can just sketch this idea of a model as process or a model as

01:45:56.500 --> 01:46:02.580
transition, maybe, because this was really an interesting read for me when engaging with the

01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:09.380
model, maybe the tendency within me might be too strong to kind of skip a stage or something like

01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:14.980
that, and you would maybe argue if I would lay out my ideas in terms of, okay, there should not be

01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:21.540
any form of wage labor relation or any connection between labor and pay and stuff like that, and you

01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:29.860
would possibly answer me, well, Jan, this is not the world we're living in right now. You should

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:37.060
keep in mind that people are socialized within these forms of relations, and we should consider

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:43.220
that when developing our models, and I can absolutely see that you do consider this. So

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:55.060
maybe to make it into a question, how would we go about this idea of transition, like in the sense

01:46:55.060 --> 01:47:04.020
of how could we transition to a multi-level democratic iterative coordination, and how do

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:09.940
you think about the transition within the model and the maturing within the model? Because this

01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:16.660
seemed to be something that is very much on all of the groundings that you think about,

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:22.740
that there is a process of maturing and that we should keep this in mind. Maybe you could just

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:28.500
give your thoughts on that, because I think it's really important, actually.

01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:40.500
Oh, well, okay. First of all, your speculative utopian projection of why do people have to

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:46.180
receive wages at all is very good. It's very smart. We should never forget that. I think what you're

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:54.980
doing with that is you're saying we can be in what Marx would have called the lower phase

01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:02.020
of a communist society, and we could be dealing with the realities of that, and the fact that

01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:09.300
the higher phase cannot be just jumped into immediately. We can't immediately go to what

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:17.780
we later on started to call full communism. Okay, let's assume that's true, but that doesn't

01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:23.860
mean we can't think about it and keep thinking about it constantly in our minds.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:32.100
If you were in a precursor stage of socialist development, let's suppose you had made

01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:41.860
significant progress at removing the capitalist class from its residual power, from its ability.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:47.940
It's lost the state in a political revolution, let's say, but we're in a kind of a very early

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:56.900
socialist environment where capitalist principles out in the real world are still simmering below

01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:06.740
the surface and could reemerge. We have a mixed economy, or China. We have a strong state sector.

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:15.700
We have a socialist mandate at some level, at least socialist in the sense of an understood

01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:18.500
politically supplied central

01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:30.900
state enterprises providing some forms of stability and security for working people.

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:39.460
But we also have a spontaneous market system, and we don't stamp it out. Our goal isn't to

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:44.660
stamp that out any more than in the Soviet Union. They want to stamp out the television

01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:59.060
repair guy who plays a very important role. He fills a need, but of course that can obviously

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.020
could have negative potentials for income distribution and stratification

01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:12.980
farther down the road. We keep an eye on it. There we have our informal economy.

01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:21.620
What we're trying to do is, through stages, gradually building up to the point where

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:29.300
rather than allowing a private market sector to coalesce into a small capitalist sector and then

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:38.340
a not so small capitalist sector, and recreate class divisions of the sort which could undermine

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:45.460
the material base for our political project overall. It could overturn us. We don't want that,

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:53.620
but we also understand that by trying to stamp them out at a stage before we have the kind of

01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:57.860
flexible and systematic and sophisticated planning mechanism,

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:09.300
I'll use my term, MDIC kind, that could absorb them. What we want to do is we want to create

01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:17.300
the conditions where those kinds of spontaneous entities with their negative potentials

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:24.900
increasingly can cease to exist because we have the opportunity to create alternatives to them.

01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:32.500
That means creating a really good, well-functioning, flexible MDIC system.

01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:40.100
One of the things that we can do politically is attempt to support that MDIC system

01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:48.900
in the context of a precursor economy, not now thinking about the MDIC model as being

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:56.900
dominant, but thinking of it as just something we're attempting to start to build.

01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:02.340
There are many tricky problems here, most of which I assume I have never even thought through,

01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:05.700
or we haven't even begun to think about this stuff.

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:16.660
You can't set up an MDIC system on a tiny little scale. You can't create a tiny little pilot

01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:23.860
project within a state sector. The state sector and its overall characteristics, it's got some

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:35.140
stabilizing characteristics to it and probably even some economic advantages. It has

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:42.020
economies of scale that you can draw upon for society as a whole, but it also creates

01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:47.780
huge bureaucracies which have their own little centers of power that begin to develop, and it

01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:57.140
creates bad politics internally within it. This is part of what we're dealing with, and I'd love

01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:04.900
to be able to say, well, we could just develop a tiny little socialist planning sector, democratic

01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:11.940
planning in this environment, and it would gradually grow. I came up with an idea a few

01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:16.980
years ago, totally controversial, and many people hate it, but that's okay,

01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:27.140
that you could actually have a bicameral legislature. Of course, the problem here

01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:32.740
is how would you get to a bicameral legislature if you didn't have the political will to achieve

01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:37.620
this? If you had the political will, you might not need it in the first place, so I'm not sure

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:42.580
whether this really makes sense, but it's the way my mind is heading. You would have a popular

01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:47.700
assembly which would be elected by direct vote of the population. It would be a real,

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:55.300
a democratically, talking about the electoral form, and you'd also have another house

01:53:55.300 --> 01:54:07.380
of the parliament, which would be a core economy council, and to elect representatives to the core

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:13.380
economy council, you have to work in a core economy enterprise. You have to be part of the core,

01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:22.660
so if you are a core economy council enterprise member, you vote for the core economy council,

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:29.140
but you also vote as a citizen for the popular assembly. Other people who work in the private

01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:35.300
sector or also the informal economy just vote for the popular assembly.

01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:44.420
In a society where electoral traditions are very strong, if you're in Western Europe, the United

01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:50.260
States, in these kinds of society, some kind of a bicameral legislature of that kind, existing

01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:57.620
temporarily might be a useful way to go, because it provides an additional incentive

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:05.780
so that we're an enterprise, and let's say we're privately owned, or maybe we're a state enterprise,

01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:14.260
but not part of the core economy, and we have meetings, and it can be pretty contentious

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:21.220
meetings, it can be difficult meetings, at which certain people say, look, we should be part of the

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:25.700
core economy, we should apply for membership in the core economy, we should become an enterprise

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:32.660
that's part of this iterative planning, democratic iterative planning mechanism.

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:42.180
Many advantages to it. Now, in addition to just the economic advantages of

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:51.140
the resources that you have available, and you might have expertise of the central planning

01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:59.620
folks can come and work, be in residence with you, help you develop your computer systems,

01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:06.980
connect you to the intranets and internets that run the whole thing on the basis of

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:15.460
internet doesn't run it, but it's a tool for running it, and participation in some of the

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:20.500
deliberations and the meetings of sub bodies within the planning system, you have a lot of

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:25.860
connections, but in addition, you can vote for the core economy council, you get to vote twice.

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:29.860
It's just an idea, it's just an idea, I don't know.

01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:39.140
You could get into a low level equilibrium trap kind of a situation, you could get into a

01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:46.340
situation where the resources to push you past that threshold where the core economy

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:52.100
begins to be able to become dominant simply by demonstrating its superiority,

01:56:53.060 --> 01:57:00.820
by demonstrating its superiority as a mechanism for ensuring democracy, human development,

01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:10.020
the whole thing. So the core economy isn't quite strong enough to do that, and you have a private

01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:15.140
market sector with various divisions within it, you may have a cooperative sector, and you may

01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:20.100
have a state sector, which is not part of the core economy, but which exerts a strong political

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.340
influence on the society, and people who operate within that, the mandarins,

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:31.060
they like their power, they like being where they are, they also recognize that their power

01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:37.540
is constrained because of the existence of these other forces, it's kind of like a political

01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:42.980
stalemate, and how do you move beyond that stalemate and get to the point where the core economy can

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:49.220
develop? But I'll finish by saying the core economy in principle should be able to pick up

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:55.700
those informal sectors, it should be able to absorb them. There's no reason, for example,

01:57:55.700 --> 01:58:02.340
why there can't be consumer good repair collectives that form and that are superior

01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:09.460
to individuals working by themselves and in ignorance of who their potential market is

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:16.900
and where people can't find them, and I can give you plenty examples of where spontaneous

01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:24.900
market mechanisms produce non-optimal results, even in the narrowest terms of

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:34.900
the most efficient way to accomplish some task, so you can do much better by forming collectives

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:40.500
and operating as a non-core collective subject to rules, I mean there are going to be rules

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:49.300
regarding wages, regarding health and safety, all of that is going to be there, and eventually

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:58.660
applying for membership in the core economy, which you could obviously do, and there's no

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:05.780
reason why the MDI system couldn't incorporate everything that we now think of as agriculture,

01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:12.420
services and so forth and so on. There's one more issue which I could talk about,

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:16.420
but I won't, I'll stop, and that's entrepreneurial labor. What do we do

01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:20.580
about entrepreneurs and innovation? Maybe we'll do it another time.

01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:29.940
Well, I mean we already covered a lot of ground, and before we finish up, I just wanted to

01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:37.780
give you the possibility and also simply hear about it. I mean the science and society special

01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:43.060
issues on envisioning socialism, they have been such an important driver of the debate.

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:49.380
Yes, I could see the new issue, nice, very nice. I mean the audience won't be able to see it, but

01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:56.980
it's out right now in April, so go and get it. I mean they have been such a huge

01:59:57.140 --> 02:00:02.660
driver and important driver of the debate, and I mean not everybody will know about the project,

02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:08.420
so could you maybe explain what envisioning socialism is to our audience, and maybe also

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:16.500
give an idea of what it meant to try to push this debate all over these, I mean now 30 years,

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:22.900
and also specifically during a period which was termed the end of history, quote unquote.

02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:30.580
I mean the first issue came out in 1992. This was peak end of history, so yeah.

02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:38.500
Well, not too much I can say. People should go to the science and society website,

02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:46.580
which is just scienceandsocietyand.com, and there's a link for Guilford Press,

02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:51.540
which is our publisher, where you can order the issue or subscribe to the journal. I'd love to

02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:56.900
have you do that. First, I need to clarify some things. The journal, Science and Society,

02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:04.580
does not necessarily endorse, people have different views on it, you know, obviously everyone

02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:10.980
at Science and Society thinks it's a worthwhile project, but there's a variety of different

02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:16.180
positions and takes on it, and among the participants in a particular issue, this is the

02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:22.580
fourth issue in the project that I'm personally looking at. I'm sorry I can't show it to

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:34.100
the listeners to this podcast, but authors range from a major Chinese contributor, Enfu Cheng,

02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:40.340
Pat Devine, Robin Hanel, their names have been mentioned before as being people who have

02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:44.900
participated in previous Science and Society special issues, but a number of other, I won't

02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:51.140
name everybody who's here, the guest editors of this issue are Al Campbell and myself,

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:58.580
and I also ought to emphasize that I do not speak for that group of people as a collective,

02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:05.540
there's a lot of different views, a lot of controversy on how to think about all of this,

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:11.860
but the one thing I think most people would agree upon is that we do have to think about it,

02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:17.300
it's very, very crucial, and even those of us who are thinking about systematic socialism who go

02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:24.980
beyond the level that people for whom socialism is just human goodwill and eliminating the gross

02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:31.700
inequality and crises of contemporary societies, moving beyond that and moving to something that

02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:37.540
fulfills our human potential more than we have in the past, and who haven't gotten beyond that,

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:43.460
who aren't ready to embrace any concept of systemic socialism of any kind,

02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:52.740
I think we play a very essential role for being an attractive potential for

02:02:55.620 --> 02:03:00.900
a much wider community that could play a very significant political role and a necessary

02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:10.500
political role in the society of the present, so I urge everyone to be part of that conversation,

02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:16.020
whether through our journal or through all other media, including podcasts and

02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.020
Zoom conferences and everything else that we try to do.

02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:28.260
Absolutely, so let's all get engaged with systemic socialism, or at least everybody who's interested,

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:34.020
it's desperately needed. There's a last question that I ask all of my guests and that is,

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:37.220
if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:43.700
I'd have to say I'm just joyful about the possibilities.

02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:48.100
We're in a period of time when it's not always easy to be joyful.

02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:55.220
I won't go into details, everybody knows what's happening in the world and why.

02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:04.500
Our joy might be compressed a little bit by dwelling on that too much,

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:10.580
but we have the ability, we have the potential to get beyond that, and

02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:19.220
even if you're not sure it's true or not, but you know that other people do think that it's true,

02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:25.860
that systemic socialism in some sense, socialism as more than just a set of shared values,

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:32.580
which is important, but socialism in the sense of an actual alternative to the way things are done.

02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:38.180
One of the things that Al and I, the co-editors of the special issue

02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:47.540
of Science and Society, insisted on as part of this is that we simply have to get

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:55.780
further. I won't say beyond, I'll say further than. The level of thinking which says,

02:04:55.780 --> 02:05:00.340
why don't we just all treat ourselves well? Why don't we just apply the golden rule?

02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:08.980
If socialism is going to be a serious contender and is going to be the foundation for real

02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:15.700
oppositional politics in today's world, socialists are going to have to be able to answer the question,

02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:21.460
how would you do things differently? How would you actually make things work?

02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:27.220
And I think an awful lot of people, be honest with yourself, maybe you're in that category,

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:32.100
will say we love the values that are, otherwise we wouldn't be listening to this podcast, you know,

02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:41.780
we love, you guys are, you have a good vision of humanity in place, but do you really know how to

02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:47.940
get things done? Can you really get things done the way the financial institutions and the

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:53.940
stock markets and the corporate bureaucracies, you know, that run this world for a capitalist

02:05:54.820 --> 02:06:02.340
entity that is in charge of it? Can you accomplish that, what they do, let alone do it better than

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:08.340
they do it? And if you think honestly, you may say, well, I'm not sure I have an answer to that.

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:12.020
Well, that's what we're looking for, we're looking for answers to those questions,

02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:17.460
and we won't find them all at once, we won't find some grand magnificent answer,

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:24.980
which answers every aspect of every question, won't happen, it'll be by process, and people

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:28.980
will be entering into that with partial solutions, which we can't even imagine what they are right

02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:36.340
now, we don't know, because that's the democratic part of the total picture, you know, we need those

02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:44.500
inputs, even though we don't yet know what they are, because they will help us to form continuing,

02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:51.460
not complete answers, but continuing answers to the questions of how we can get on with developing

02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:58.340
everything that human beings are capable of being. And that's, that's, in simple terms,

02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:04.820
what the project is all about. Awesome. David, thank you so much for taking the time and being
