00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Welcome to Future Histories.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.640
My name is Jan Gross, and it is my great pleasure to welcome Elisa Longcón,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.440
Auntie Leo, in today's episode.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.960
She's a linguist and professor in the Department of Education at the

00:12.960 --> 00:17.800
University of Santiago de Chile, and she has been the first president of

00:17.800 --> 00:20.080
the Constitutional Convention in Chile.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.920
Just like the very recent episode with Matt Huber, I also recorded today's

00:25.920 --> 00:30.600
episode at the The Great Transition Conference, where I was invited to

00:30.600 --> 00:34.520
take part in a symposium on democratic planning.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.680
Many thanks to everybody involved.

00:36.680 --> 00:41.360
It has been a great pleasure to be able to meet so many interesting people there.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.000
I really enjoyed it.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.600
A little pointer to my German speaking audience.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.840
I think today's episode connects really nicely to the second

00:50.840 --> 00:53.320
episode I recorded with Daniel Leuch.

00:53.720 --> 00:59.400
That would be episode 39 of season two of Future Histories, titled

00:59.560 --> 01:03.920
Daniel Leuch zu Freiheit, Souveränität und Recht ohne Gewalt.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.600
And then a little pointer to my English speaking audience as well.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.120
You do have the possibility to subscribe to the English episodes only.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.960
But now please enjoy today's episode with Elisa Longcón Antilio.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.880
Welcome, Elisa.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.920
Hi, my name is Elisa Longcón Antilio.

01:46.360 --> 01:54.560
Hello to everybody.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.720
I'm greeting you in my mother tongue.

01:59.160 --> 02:05.280
That is very important for me and for my people that you hear my

02:05.280 --> 02:11.960
voice in my mother tongue, because we are a virginal nation here in Chile.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.800
And our language is losing today.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.560
So it's our role to recover it.

02:19.760 --> 02:24.200
Thank you to invite me to attend this meeting.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.760
It's a great pleasure.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.920
Thank you for being here.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.800
For those who don't know anything about the constitutional process that has been

02:31.800 --> 02:37.480
started in Chile in 2020, could you give us an overview of the process that was

02:37.480 --> 02:41.480
set up for the collective development of the new Chilean constitution?

02:41.720 --> 02:43.440
What was special about it?

02:43.800 --> 02:49.560
Yeah, I want to tell you that it was a very important process for

02:49.560 --> 02:51.200
a lot of the Chilean people.

02:51.840 --> 03:04.200
It didn't start at 2020 because it's born from the social movement.

03:04.320 --> 03:13.560
Long time ago, I want to mention 2006 with a student from high school.

03:13.640 --> 03:20.960
They initiate a very big demands for public education at that time.

03:21.480 --> 03:32.760
So the student from university, they was also in the mobilization and call all of

03:32.760 --> 03:35.000
the social Chilean movement.

03:35.120 --> 03:45.480
So we had a very, very hard social situation in 2019.

03:45.880 --> 03:54.040
Million of people took the streets at that time, demanding social rights for the people.

03:54.520 --> 04:04.040
So the government and the parliament called for a special meeting in order to establish

04:04.120 --> 04:13.080
an accord, a political accord to have a referendum to change the Pinochet constitution.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.960
So they did it.

04:15.200 --> 04:25.160
And then in 2021, we created the first Constituent's Assembly.

04:27.520 --> 04:37.280
That included a hundred and fifty five conventional and that include also the

04:37.360 --> 04:47.720
priority, also the indigenous nations and all the social movements and political parties.

04:48.120 --> 04:58.080
So we started to to wrote the new constitution and in one year we got it.

04:58.560 --> 05:05.600
And then we have a new referendum in order to approve or refuse the proposal.

05:06.120 --> 05:11.760
That proposal included the right for nature, right for indigenous people,

05:12.480 --> 05:20.960
parity in the women, equality between women and men, social rights and all of them for all of the

05:21.280 --> 05:22.840
aboriginal nation too.

05:23.240 --> 05:31.560
So, but we had a bigger difficult situation because the citizenship rejected the new

05:31.560 --> 05:38.600
proposal. It was rejected in September 4th last year.

05:40.200 --> 05:54.000
But the main topic, why it was rejected was the fake news, hate discourses, the people who are in

05:54.000 --> 06:03.840
the rejection position, they create a lot of misinformation about the constituent process,

06:03.840 --> 06:11.200
about the conventionals and people fear to give the votes for that new constitution.

06:11.640 --> 06:18.440
Some of the fake news was they said that they will lost the house.

06:19.240 --> 06:23.360
There is no right for to have a house.

06:23.720 --> 06:33.760
There is no right to have, for instance, social security or they said that the indigenous people

06:33.760 --> 06:42.680
want to divide Chile and the indigenous people hate the Chilean people.

06:43.120 --> 06:50.360
So those were hate discourses and people have feared about that.

06:50.400 --> 06:58.240
So they rejected the constitution, the new proposal that we wrote at that time.

06:58.960 --> 07:09.320
So the government called for a meeting with the parliament and they decided to improve the process

07:09.840 --> 07:13.680
and call for the second constitutional process.

07:13.960 --> 07:22.000
We are today in the second constitutional process, but they modify the representation of the people

07:22.440 --> 07:33.440
because they include a no democratic way to to vote, to elect the conventionals.

07:34.080 --> 07:43.560
And they decide that half of all of the team that will wrote the constitution,

07:43.560 --> 07:48.640
that they must be designated by political parties.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.880
There wasn't a democracy process.

07:53.280 --> 08:00.120
So they they decided to include people from political parties,

08:00.600 --> 08:03.000
exclude the indigenous people.

08:03.840 --> 08:17.800
And then there was we had a new referendum to to vote for the half 50, 51, a conventional again.

08:18.040 --> 08:27.600
We had it just two weeks ago and but there was not a special seat for indigenous.

08:28.400 --> 08:37.920
The indigenous people elected one Mapuche person to to represent the the indigenous

08:37.920 --> 08:41.400
interests inside the second process.

08:42.400 --> 08:56.800
But the designated conventional, they are today as assessor, political is a political teams

08:57.920 --> 09:01.040
experimenting in contention in constitution.

09:01.840 --> 09:13.120
They draw the the proposal and inside that proposal, there wasn't there was not people.

09:14.240 --> 09:20.040
There were no there were people, indigenous people inside the design.

09:20.680 --> 09:30.520
So in that second frame, there is no participation of indigenous people today.

09:30.640 --> 09:40.520
The elected people from the council, they will review that proposal, the second proposal.

09:40.920 --> 09:51.400
But we don't we are not agree with the misrepresentation of the indigenous people.

09:52.280 --> 10:02.040
And we will have a next at the end of this year, we will have the new referendum to in order to

10:02.040 --> 10:06.440
decide if we approve or we reject the new proposal.

10:06.520 --> 10:14.520
The new proposal today, we don't know how that's that proposal will include indigenous

10:14.520 --> 10:19.080
right or mother nature rights or women's rights.

10:19.200 --> 10:27.720
Those are the more difficult topic for the conservative parties.

10:28.080 --> 10:34.280
Today, the voice is for the conservative parties.

10:34.920 --> 10:41.640
Were there special obstacles within the process for the Chilean constitution?

10:42.040 --> 10:47.080
Because if I remember correctly, I think in Bolivia, for example, they had a constitutional

10:47.080 --> 10:50.160
process, and it was different than the one in Chile.

10:50.480 --> 10:56.040
And if I remember correctly, then I think in some talk that you gave you, I think you stated

10:56.120 --> 11:03.800
that the way that it was set up, that there was a referendum after the process with a with

11:03.800 --> 11:10.320
this certain percentage that would have to be reached, that this was a special obstacle

11:10.320 --> 11:14.280
within the process for the Chilean constitution.

11:14.560 --> 11:20.640
Is that right? Am I remembering this correctly, or is it was it a very regular process, the

11:20.640 --> 11:22.160
way it was set up in Chile?

11:22.640 --> 11:28.560
No, there is there is not a regular process in Chile.

11:28.720 --> 11:37.000
The constitutional discussion is a democratic constitutional discussion is a new process

11:37.160 --> 11:44.880
today in Chile, because the last constitution was written by the dictatorship regime without

11:45.920 --> 11:47.640
social participation.

11:48.280 --> 11:56.400
So this is the last process that we did from twenty twenty one.

11:56.440 --> 12:03.720
It was a really new process because included all of the social movement.

12:04.080 --> 12:12.480
It was for the first time in the history of Chilean society that a half part of the

12:12.480 --> 12:15.960
conventional were women, for instance.

12:16.520 --> 12:23.560
There is no constitution written by women in any in here and outside of Chile.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.760
So that is was a very, very important.

12:28.040 --> 12:34.640
And that is that was the difference between the Bolivian process, the Bolivian constitutional

12:34.640 --> 12:42.640
process or Ecuador, a constitutional process, because here the the participation of women

12:42.640 --> 12:51.440
was really were in equal relationship between women and men in that first process.

12:51.640 --> 13:00.120
But today seem are very different because the this expert commission elected by political

13:00.120 --> 13:11.960
party, they avoid all of the topic that we included in the first process.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.320
So today is really different from the first process.

13:19.640 --> 13:28.640
And one thing that is also very important is in the first process, we include the plurinationality.

13:29.120 --> 13:41.000
The plurinationality is a political proposal that born in the Bolivian process, also from

13:41.000 --> 13:49.240
Ecuador process, the indigenous people there, they they they speak about the plurinationality.

13:49.280 --> 14:00.120
And we as we are also Chile is have a diversity of nation nation here.

14:00.440 --> 14:09.280
So we included like plurinationality as the political way to resolve the conflict between

14:09.280 --> 14:20.120
the state and indigenous people to overcome genocide, racism, damage, coexistence, also

14:20.120 --> 14:29.320
to recover all of the collective rights, because there is no political solution from

14:29.320 --> 14:41.640
the state to resolve ancestral or historical problem that that did the creation of the

14:41.680 --> 14:49.880
states with aboriginal nation, aboriginal nation didn't participate in the creation of

14:49.880 --> 14:57.880
the states. So for the first time, we included and we said, OK, we are different.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.800
There are diversity of nation here.

15:00.800 --> 15:08.200
So all together will define the framework, the constitution for all of the Chilean people.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.440
So that is what's really strong and very important.

15:13.320 --> 15:21.640
But in this second process, they avoid the plurinationality because they said that the

15:21.640 --> 15:28.280
people rejected. But I told you that people rejected because of hate discourse.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.760
It was not true that we are going we hope to divide Chile.

15:33.760 --> 15:39.400
We need a relationship, equal relationship with Chilean society.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
That's all.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.520
And when it comes to plurinationality, how does that work if there are like conflicting

15:48.560 --> 15:55.320
rights, since if there are different nations within the nation, so to speak, and these

15:55.320 --> 16:01.000
different nations have different ideas of, for example, how the question of rights should

16:01.000 --> 16:07.840
be approached? Is there a way how to address it when there are different opinions that

16:07.840 --> 16:09.480
clash with each other?

16:09.640 --> 16:16.800
Because I imagine it wouldn't be a good idea to simply overrule one over the other.

16:16.840 --> 16:22.880
But there needs to be a process of getting to an understanding of the different forms

16:22.880 --> 16:28.320
of how rights are being conceptualized within the nations in the nation.

16:28.760 --> 16:32.120
I'm not sure if this was a question that can be understood.

16:32.880 --> 16:43.680
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, I understand your question because people fear about the plurinationality

16:43.680 --> 16:53.440
when they think that the indigenous will use the rights of the non-indigenous people.

16:54.520 --> 17:06.120
And the question they did is, does the indigenous will have more rights than non-indigenous

17:06.120 --> 17:17.720
people? You know, but there is no problem inside if you understand a lot of problem

17:17.720 --> 17:21.720
that we had along the history with the indigenous.

17:22.080 --> 17:33.760
The plurinationality first supports that Chilean society must recognize the pre-existence

17:34.040 --> 17:43.520
of the indigenous because we were first here in that territory, then came the state.

17:45.240 --> 17:50.720
The second point is, it's different to think about nations and state.

17:51.760 --> 17:55.880
The state, it's an organization of nation.

17:56.840 --> 18:04.960
But what happened with the internal colonialism inside the Chilean state?

18:06.520 --> 18:15.960
They organized the state just with the white point of view, without the point of view of

18:15.960 --> 18:24.640
indigenous people. So we have a long violation of human rights inside of our country.

18:24.800 --> 18:35.080
We have genocide, the colonial project settled here in Chile and in America.

18:35.520 --> 18:43.960
It was a genocide project that killed a nation, an aboriginal nation.

18:44.400 --> 18:52.800
Not only nation, not only killed physically, they killed our culture, our language and

18:52.800 --> 18:56.560
deprived us about our human rights.

18:57.280 --> 19:06.760
We were not included as human inside the creation of the state from the beginning.

19:07.360 --> 19:18.200
They said that we were like people from pre-logic, primitive, without conscience.

19:19.040 --> 19:25.440
A lot of work in order to avoid our rights.

19:25.560 --> 19:34.840
So your question is, we are in the 21st century and we are still alive today.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.080
I am a teacher in the university.

19:39.080 --> 19:42.360
I work every day with a Chilean student.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.880
You know, my neighbor are Chileans.

19:46.480 --> 19:51.480
So we need an equal relationship between them.

19:52.480 --> 20:02.800
States, governments, after the dictatorship regime, they recognized that there was a

20:02.800 --> 20:10.960
problem, historical problem, injustice problem inside of our state with indigenous people.

20:11.680 --> 20:17.920
They create a law, they create a special commission in order to resolve that problem.

20:18.320 --> 20:25.200
They vote in favor of the United Nations Declaration for Indigenous People, for

20:25.200 --> 20:27.640
instance, or ELO Convention.

20:28.800 --> 20:36.040
Our governments here give the votes in order to accept that ELO Convention that speaks

20:36.040 --> 20:39.360
about a political right of indigenous people.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.520
So, but what happened here in the country?

20:44.800 --> 20:54.720
They, they erase the rights that they recognize internationally.

20:55.680 --> 21:04.320
So what we need, we need those rights to be practices inside the country, inside the

21:04.320 --> 21:07.600
society, and we need to live our rights.

21:08.440 --> 21:16.320
I speaking about collective rights because they are individual rights and also collective

21:16.320 --> 21:19.120
rights. Our rights are collective rights.

21:19.160 --> 21:25.200
For instance, language is a collective rights because I can speak my language.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.760
If I have, if I find somebody that is speaking my language, I need the collective.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.480
Community is a collective right.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.760
We the indigenous, we live in community.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.800
We live with our family.

21:39.280 --> 21:44.840
We have a big family because it connected with the community.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.960
That is our collective right.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.960
Autonomy and self-determination.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.160
It's also a collective rights.

21:53.760 --> 21:58.520
All of them was, were recognized by our governments.

21:58.880 --> 22:05.480
So what we need today, we need to include it inside the law in order to live our right,

22:05.800 --> 22:12.440
in order to, to, to be recognized as people, as human, you know?

22:12.920 --> 22:18.760
So that's the topic that the Chilean people need to understand.

22:19.200 --> 22:26.640
Those rights is not again the Chilean because we, we had our territory, but our

22:26.640 --> 22:34.600
territory was occupied, but we need our territory in order to live and government

22:34.600 --> 22:40.880
and a state have international instruments in order to solve that problem.

22:42.120 --> 22:46.240
We need them, we needed to implement it.

22:46.520 --> 22:53.760
And we are here talking about that topic in order to help to implement it.

22:54.200 --> 23:00.440
The right, those rights collective that in our territory in democratic way.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.880
This is the plural nationality.

23:03.200 --> 23:09.640
So to resolve historical problem that have the state with the indigenous people in our

23:09.640 --> 23:14.920
territory, using the democratic way of solution.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.480
Very interesting.

23:16.640 --> 23:22.880
One of the questions that I was asking myself when preparing is that on a certain level

23:22.920 --> 23:32.440
that there seems to be a form of contradiction because you propose to use this element of a

23:32.680 --> 23:38.520
constitution, of a constitutional convention in this case, of a constitution, which comes out

23:38.520 --> 23:43.920
of a certain political tradition, a tradition of political theory as well.

23:44.240 --> 23:50.240
And it is closely tied, for example, to a specific notion of subjects is and it's a

23:50.280 --> 23:54.240
Western notion of subjects, a subject of reason.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.600
You already pointed towards this, that is kind of underlying this notion of a

23:59.600 --> 24:00.880
constitution as well.

24:01.120 --> 24:07.600
And this is, of course, not unproblematic, because as you pointed out, indigenous people

24:07.600 --> 24:13.120
were for a long time excluded from this notion of subject.

24:13.960 --> 24:20.240
And I was wondering how these things can be brought together, because while there are

24:20.240 --> 24:27.000
certainly aspects within this notion of subject that have served as a carrier, so to speak,

24:27.000 --> 24:34.040
for also emancipatory projects, for example, broadly speaking, within a left humanist

24:34.320 --> 24:41.040
project throughout history, this notion of subject has, of course, also been used as a

24:41.040 --> 24:47.720
carrier for forms of domination and subjugation of other humans and also of nature.

24:48.480 --> 24:53.720
So this has been an instrument of exclusion and oppression as well.

24:53.760 --> 25:01.480
So my question would be, how can then a constitution, which is, as I said, an element of

25:01.480 --> 25:10.120
Western political philosophy, you know, how can a constitution be thought of and enacted

25:10.400 --> 25:18.200
without having to rely on this specific notion of a, let's say, liberal subject?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.280
Yeah, yes.

25:20.400 --> 25:34.360
So for us, I think that for all of the social movements around the world, we need to

25:34.360 --> 25:43.080
understand that there is no, we are still keeping historical problems.

25:45.640 --> 25:59.720
And the right wing, left wing, they promised to all of the society from all of the continent

26:00.480 --> 26:07.000
that they will resolve the problem that we have in the society.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.720
I'm speaking about Eurocentric philosophy.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.280
I'm speaking about capitalism and about Marxism.

26:18.520 --> 26:27.720
The idea of progress that it came to our continent is a political idea.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.280
It's not an economical project.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.400
It's an ideological project.

26:36.040 --> 26:49.720
And European people believe at that time that with that solution, the progress inside of

26:49.800 --> 26:55.240
our continent, they will solve the problem that we have here.

26:56.840 --> 27:02.280
But progress never come to our territory.

27:03.560 --> 27:09.000
Indigenous people, we are still, we are living without our rights.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.160
I told you our collective rights.

27:12.120 --> 27:19.720
Progress also doesn't solve the women rights.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.920
Women were sacrificed by the progress ideology.

27:26.920 --> 27:31.320
Indigenous was sacrificed by the progress ideology.

27:32.280 --> 27:41.480
Nature was sacrificed by progress philosophy because they need to exploit it in order to

27:41.480 --> 27:45.560
give social security for the people.

27:45.560 --> 27:50.600
And that is not true because we don't, we are living without social security.

27:51.960 --> 27:57.720
Indigenous people, there is no recognition of the right of women, for instance.

27:57.720 --> 28:16.360
Women was considered like an inferior human from men, and men decide for women from the beginning.

28:17.240 --> 28:24.920
I'm speaking about 1492 when the Spaniards came to our continent.

28:25.880 --> 28:32.760
They did it in order to have a modernity in our continent.

28:35.160 --> 28:40.920
But they sacrifice for the progress, sacrifice the people for the progress.

28:42.600 --> 28:52.920
And Marxist ideology didn't say we have a violation of human rights

28:53.720 --> 28:55.640
with that ideology.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.000
They support the progress.

28:58.120 --> 29:04.200
They support the progress because they said bourgeois are making progress.

29:04.200 --> 29:12.120
We need that progress in order to resolve the, to have in the future unclass society.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.320
But we need the progress.

29:13.880 --> 29:21.000
They don't discuss the deep philosophy that was inside the progress.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.840
Again, indigenous, again, against women.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.800
Today we have those problems in everywhere.

29:31.400 --> 29:37.320
So what we need today, we need to rethink about what we did in the past,

29:38.280 --> 29:47.240
what the European culture did or philosophy, European philosophy did for all of the continent

29:47.240 --> 29:53.720
because the progress born from Europe, it doesn't born from Africa.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.120
It doesn't born from Latin America.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.440
It was born in Europe.

30:01.480 --> 30:06.280
And they use the ideology for all of the world.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.800
Today the problem is in everywhere, in all the continent.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.600
There is no solution for those, our rights.

30:15.320 --> 30:21.240
So what we need today, we are in the 21st century.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.520
We need to talk together.

30:23.080 --> 30:30.440
We need to include diversity way of thinking because the colonial European Eurocentric

30:30.440 --> 30:34.280
way of thinking doesn't give the solution to our problems.

30:35.160 --> 30:42.120
And we support that there are philosophy, there are political models

30:42.840 --> 30:48.760
or communitarian systems in our territory, inside of our society.

30:49.560 --> 30:58.120
So we need to recover it in order to find together a plural solution

30:58.760 --> 31:03.400
and include the plurality inside the democracy.

31:03.400 --> 31:07.160
Because the democracies is defined by white people

31:07.160 --> 31:14.920
and is defined by the idea of progress and democracy is still making sacrifice

31:14.920 --> 31:18.680
of our people and also in everywhere.

31:19.560 --> 31:27.080
So we need to modify our conception of state, our conception of constitution.

31:28.120 --> 31:34.840
The way how to modify it is including the diversity, including different philosophy,

31:35.400 --> 31:41.880
including all of our rights as human, individual and collective rights,

31:41.880 --> 31:46.840
and also women's rights, but also nature rights.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.240
Because we have other philosophy.

31:51.240 --> 31:55.160
Indigenous people, we believe that nature is alive.

31:55.160 --> 32:02.680
For instance, hers is alive and we need to be in relationship with nature.

32:03.640 --> 32:15.080
And that's way of thinking is not include the right wing, neither in left wing.

32:15.880 --> 32:21.240
So we need to talk, we need to share other way of thinking.

32:22.280 --> 32:29.400
What would you say would be a good route to implement this different form of,

32:29.400 --> 32:37.960
I would say, relationality towards nature for, in this case, in my case, for example,

32:37.960 --> 32:42.760
for someone like me coming from a Western background.

32:43.560 --> 32:52.360
Because I think that it's not a possibility to simply adopt Mapuche philosophy, for example,

32:53.320 --> 33:00.520
because this is like a very different way, not only of thinking, but also

33:01.240 --> 33:09.080
a philosophy that is enacted in a certain practice, as you already stated, rightly so.

33:09.800 --> 33:17.480
And so for someone like me, for example, or for a constitutional convention in other countries,

33:17.480 --> 33:24.440
let's say we would try to argue for a new constitution in Germany, where I come from,

33:24.440 --> 33:33.000
and we would want to have a different form of relationality towards nature to be a part of this

33:33.000 --> 33:40.360
new constitutional process and the constitution that will be brought about through this process.

33:40.360 --> 33:46.760
We want a different form of relationality to nature to be inscribed into this constitution as well.

33:47.880 --> 33:57.160
What would you say can be a framework that can be used for people that do not come from a

33:57.720 --> 34:04.680
practice and from a also philosophical background that already has this different form of

34:04.680 --> 34:15.240
relationality within it? How can we include it in processes that used to argue from a

34:15.240 --> 34:23.880
perspective of Western philosophy, but will now have to develop into other forms of relation

34:23.880 --> 34:31.480
towards nature as well? Do you have an idea of how to approach this task? Because it's a task

34:31.480 --> 34:36.600
that is not only important for Chile, of course, it's important for the whole world, because

34:37.560 --> 34:44.280
we can see how this very extractive logic, this logic of domination over nature,

34:44.280 --> 34:51.960
how this is actually destroying the basis of our existence, and we need to find different ways to

34:53.160 --> 34:59.880
relate it on a very foundational level. But it doesn't seem to happen somehow. Instead,

34:59.880 --> 35:09.080
people are arguing for quick fixes without trying to really reflect upon this deeper relation.

35:09.560 --> 35:18.280
I'm wondering if you have an idea of how to approach it in different contexts?

35:18.840 --> 35:30.120
Yes. It's a very important question because we need to understand ourselves from a different

35:30.120 --> 35:42.280
point of view. There are some theories that support diversity and plurality inside democracy,

35:42.920 --> 35:53.320
but also there are a lot of practices that recognize ourselves connected because we are

35:53.320 --> 35:59.720
not isolated inside the society. We need to have a critical point of view about development

36:00.200 --> 36:09.880
I told you, but we also need to decolonize our mind, our practice, and we need to include a

36:09.880 --> 36:20.680
new epistemology of the humankind way of thinking, because Eurocentric or European

36:21.560 --> 36:29.640
philosophy, instead of European philosophy connected with capitalism, connected with

36:29.640 --> 36:36.040
Marxism, I'm thinking about that kind of philosophy. It doesn't solve the problem.

36:38.440 --> 36:46.840
We, as indigenous everywhere in every country, we have been in our territory

36:47.640 --> 36:56.600
and using our own solution. We still keep our communitarian way of life. We are fighting to

36:59.080 --> 37:04.120
protect our language because inside of our language, there is a philosophy inside. There

37:04.120 --> 37:08.280
are a lot of knowledge that we need, so this is part of our struggle.

37:08.280 --> 37:18.360
LW – But inside the big discussion, the global discussion, we need to problematize the

37:18.360 --> 37:27.880
individualism that's born from the capitalist way of thinking. Today, the neoliberal system

37:28.840 --> 37:40.200
destroyed the connection of the people, of human with the community. We are a member of a community.

37:40.200 --> 37:50.680
We need to support the community inside of our life. Also, the topic about connecting with

37:50.680 --> 38:00.120
the mother nature. We used to learn that, for instance, that the river is far from our

38:00.840 --> 38:10.840
house, and we used to think about the water outside of us, the river outside of us,

38:11.560 --> 38:21.560
wind outside of us. But what it is inside of our body? 75% of our body is water,

38:22.840 --> 38:34.200
so the river is inside of us. What was the philosophy that supported the natural resource

38:34.920 --> 38:44.520
are outside of the people? It was the capitalism system. It was the European philosophy

38:45.160 --> 39:01.960
that just accept the rationality of man, not women. It's no difficult to include different

39:01.960 --> 39:09.720
practice today, because we need that different practice inside of our family, inside of our life,

39:09.720 --> 39:19.000
inside of our community, and inside of our country. On the contrary, we are not looking for the life

39:19.000 --> 39:28.680
of ourselves, the life of my family, the life of the environment, because the pollution

39:29.640 --> 39:41.160
is contaminated our life, so our environment, and there is no possibility to have life

39:43.160 --> 39:55.240
in our place, in our space. We need to protect life, all kinds of life, our life, insect life,

39:55.720 --> 40:08.280
animal life, because we need the biological diversity. We need it for the future of our humanity,

40:09.880 --> 40:22.600
and all of the country, all of the culture in the world, we have the same environmental problem.

40:23.560 --> 40:32.440
For instance, women problems, persecution of indigenous leaders, every, all of the country

40:32.440 --> 40:43.640
have it, the discrimination, racial discrimination. So, my, the problem that the indigenous people

40:44.600 --> 40:49.880
are have today in our community,

40:52.680 --> 41:01.000
it's those problems you can also find it in your European, or in Europe, or in America, and everywhere.

41:01.560 --> 41:14.760
So, but we need our, we need to pluralize our philosophy, our epistemology, and decolonize

41:14.760 --> 41:24.120
our mind, because colonization put the one kind of way of thinking inside, like a rule for all of

41:25.080 --> 41:35.800
the world, and that is not true. And within this process, what role does a constitution play,

41:35.800 --> 41:46.520
or what role can it play in an ideal case? Because you have this plurality, but you also,

41:46.520 --> 41:58.440
and that's like one possible role a constitution can play, you have the plurality within a larger

41:58.440 --> 42:05.240
framework that is being defined through, in this case, the constitution. So, there is also

42:05.960 --> 42:15.080
a form of, let's say, unity as well, created through the constitution itself as a certain

42:15.080 --> 42:24.120
type of framework. So, what would you say, what's this relationship between the difference and the

42:25.000 --> 42:32.200
sameness? And also, what can the role of the constitution be

42:33.240 --> 42:40.680
in an ideal case? What can it do for the people? Yeah, there are different levels of solutions.

42:40.680 --> 42:50.120
There is a communitarian solution. There are, for instance, participation of the social movement,

42:52.120 --> 43:01.160
or the decision of women inside the social movement is one part of the solution.

43:01.960 --> 43:13.560
And the state is an instrument, is a structure of power. But if that structure of power

43:14.280 --> 43:20.440
doesn't recognize the rights of community, the right of women, the right of indigenous,

43:20.440 --> 43:25.400
the right of the nature, that structure is a colonial structure.

43:25.400 --> 43:35.560
And by the origin, the state was a colonial structure, but it's an instrument that all of the

43:35.560 --> 43:45.880
country has today. We can't be autonomous. For instance, indigenous people, we claim for our

43:45.880 --> 43:53.320
autonomy and self-determination in order to take our own decision. But the state, the state is

43:54.200 --> 44:05.640
but the state is there. And the state is taking decision in using without us, without us today.

44:06.520 --> 44:14.600
So, we need to be part of that, to be part of that decision inside the state.

44:15.160 --> 44:24.680
But using our way of thinking, that will be an interchange between culture, I think. On the

44:24.680 --> 44:35.240
contrary, all of the decisions that states take come from just from the white and the progress

44:35.320 --> 44:42.600
and the progress philosophy or colonial philosophy. We need to contribute it.

44:45.640 --> 44:55.480
That is the top level as the society was the design of society. The way of society is very

44:56.040 --> 45:03.320
hierarchical way of thinking. That's hierarchy. The state is in the top.

45:03.480 --> 45:13.800
But if the state respects our autonomy and self-determination, we can keep our

45:13.800 --> 45:23.320
communitarian way of life. But the state had need to recognize it. On the contrary, the law persecuted

45:23.320 --> 45:32.200
us. That's happening in our history. We were persecuted by the law of the state. When we

45:33.400 --> 45:43.880
create our flag, we have a very beautiful Mapuche flag we created in 1992. And the state

45:43.880 --> 45:52.840
persecuted us because we take the decision to have our own flag. What happened? And that was

45:53.720 --> 46:00.840
because the state didn't recognize that the indigenous people have the decision

46:00.840 --> 46:08.040
to have their own flag. Because the Chilean state didn't recognize that we are a nation.

46:08.840 --> 46:14.520
We are not a state. We are a nation. And one state can have a different nation inside.

46:20.200 --> 46:29.720
We apply for that solution to one state with different nation. And their experience in Europe

46:31.080 --> 46:39.080
they are experienced in America. The state have different nation inside and recognize

46:39.080 --> 46:46.200
the right of those nations. So we have plural state. We have multilingualism inside the state.

46:48.040 --> 46:53.640
We also have juridical pluralism inside the state in North America, for instance.

46:54.440 --> 47:04.360
Because there are people that are looking for the solution. And we can all go to find the solution.

47:06.360 --> 47:17.080
That is, we just need to know what is going on in different parts of the world and to be responsible.

47:17.080 --> 47:23.400
And to be responsible. All of us, we need to be responsible about nature. All of us

47:24.680 --> 47:34.120
need to be responsible with cultural diversity, with multilingualism. We need it, you know?

47:35.080 --> 47:46.840
So we need to talk about decolonize our way of thinking and the pluralism

47:47.880 --> 47:57.000
right for nature, women's rights. All of those topics belong to decolonize, help us to decolonize

47:57.000 --> 48:08.040
our way of thinking in order to have a new society, to have equal rights inside the difference.

48:08.920 --> 48:15.960
Great. While you were talking, I was already reflecting that the word that I used

48:16.840 --> 48:22.120
on the one side having plurality and on the other unity, that actually the word unity is the wrong

48:22.120 --> 48:28.600
one, I would say, because I encounter these kinds of discourses also, for example, in the field of

48:28.600 --> 48:35.640
there's a form of anarchist constitutionalism, and they have to deal with similar topics,

48:35.640 --> 48:44.200
also with questions of plural forms of jurisdictions within a larger organizational form,

48:44.200 --> 48:51.560
so to speak. And I have to correct myself in so far as it is not really about then creating a

48:52.280 --> 49:04.040
meta unity. That's not the goal. It's to find a framework that works with the plurality

49:05.000 --> 49:16.680
within it and can allow these different forms of approaches without bursting while doing so.

49:17.880 --> 49:23.320
But I just wanted to note that I have to correct myself in terms of this word of unity,

49:23.320 --> 49:31.960
because that's actually not the goal. It can have these parallel approaches without trying

49:31.960 --> 49:37.800
to approach a higher level of unity, so to speak. So I just wanted to...

49:37.800 --> 49:52.040
Yeah. One important thing to understand what I'm talking about is because I speak about the

49:52.040 --> 50:05.960
diversity, about plurality, and our struggle is to have a society, a plural society, plural

50:07.240 --> 50:14.920
way of life, different languages, different cultures, because inside the plurality,

50:15.720 --> 50:34.920
inside the diversity, there are the richness of our humanity. So to force unity in one way,

50:34.920 --> 50:42.040
as the European did, with unity connected with the progress.

50:44.760 --> 50:48.520
That means the genocide for indigenous people.

50:48.520 --> 50:51.320
Well, you know,

50:51.320 --> 51:14.200
a very authoritarian way to think about the unity in one historical line.

51:21.880 --> 51:25.800
Project develop European people

51:28.120 --> 51:36.680
in one historical line, because they consider us, all of the Latin America,

51:37.640 --> 51:46.760
means developed country that in the future will have the development, you know? Also international

51:47.480 --> 51:54.680
institution speak about us like underdeveloped country.

51:57.240 --> 52:03.240
They suppose that all of the policy that they did will help us for the development.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.760
And what is the development? The progress.

52:07.480 --> 52:16.200
But there was just one line of way of thinking. We were primitive, then we will be the Marxism,

52:16.840 --> 52:24.760
said that we were first, we were primitive communism, you know, feudal society, then

52:24.920 --> 52:32.200
feudal society, then capitalism, then the socialist, then we will have a

52:37.320 --> 52:43.400
a common society without class. But in one line, in one progressive line,

52:43.960 --> 52:49.160
in just one way of thinking, you know, and they implanted in everywhere.

52:50.120 --> 53:00.120
Capitalism did the same. And state, neoliberal state today are doing the same. So this is,

53:01.960 --> 53:11.560
this is why it's a part of our struggle to incide inside the state, to pluralize the state.

53:11.560 --> 53:18.040
But it's not all of our struggle, because we need our communitarian way. We need to

53:18.840 --> 53:24.920
keep our language. We need to recover our philosophy. We need to use our traditional dress.

53:24.920 --> 53:31.880
We need to, to recover traditional knowledge about how to cook food, for instance.

53:33.560 --> 53:40.680
What society today is wasting a lot of food on poor country.

53:42.040 --> 53:46.760
There are children that they don't have food. The same happened with growth.

53:48.920 --> 53:57.880
In Chile, we have a very beautiful desert at the north part of Chile. And the

54:00.520 --> 54:14.360
company used our desert for clothes, old clothes. That's a pollution for our desert.

54:14.840 --> 54:27.800
So this is why we need to pluralize our way of thinking, because just one way to consider

54:27.800 --> 54:34.040
the society and the history destroyed our humanity.

54:35.080 --> 54:41.880
Yeah. And I think I'll have to add that why I initially used the word unity, which is the,

54:42.280 --> 54:49.000
which was the wrong choice. But what I wanted to initially actually point at is that,

54:50.600 --> 54:58.040
that's why I find this notion of a constitution so interesting. And that you were the president of

54:58.040 --> 55:08.520
this process, actually, because the very notion of a constitution can be such a tool to organize

55:09.480 --> 55:15.800
this plurality. So that's at least from the contexts that I come from. For example,

55:15.800 --> 55:23.240
I did interviews with Daniel Leuk, who's a person who works very much in the tradition of anarchism

55:23.240 --> 55:31.960
and also looks closely at topics of how juridismus, juridism, I would say, maybe in English,

55:32.520 --> 55:40.680
how this can be thought in very different ways without the coercive state, without the violence

55:40.680 --> 55:49.000
of the state and stuff like that. And there are ways to approach these questions of, let's say,

55:49.880 --> 55:57.880
societal-wide organization and regulation of plurality in this case. There are ways to address

55:57.880 --> 56:05.480
this. And one of them, one way or an important tool might be the tool of constitution. And that's

56:05.480 --> 56:13.480
why I think it's such an important and interesting combination that you are so heavily involved in

56:13.480 --> 56:21.400
these both fields, like the insistence on plurality and the struggle for a different form of

56:21.400 --> 56:27.800
constitution, because these two things fit together quite interestingly, I think, and not

56:27.800 --> 56:37.080
only in terms of a defense against the state, because you can also think constitutionalism

56:37.080 --> 56:42.920
without state at all. And that's like the next evolvement.

56:42.920 --> 56:54.360
Yeah, you know, Aboriginal people, we had our own constitution, and it is oral. We learned about it

56:54.360 --> 57:02.440
by oral tradition, because one constitution is a framework that organizes one society.

57:03.400 --> 57:14.360
And all of the society, including Indigenous, we have our rules to organize our society

57:15.080 --> 57:22.600
and to understand life, rights, our rights, and non-human rights.

57:22.600 --> 57:32.680
So, but the modern society that is along the world have the state, and it's a reality. The state

57:32.680 --> 57:41.240
is one reality. We need to change. Five centuries of colonialism,

57:41.400 --> 57:51.000
the state is one reality. We need to change. Five centuries of colonialism.

57:53.960 --> 58:04.280
And we had the state today making change inside of our children, for instance, by school.

58:04.680 --> 58:19.320
Our children received the white history, not our history. White language, not our language.

58:19.560 --> 58:31.960
Who did that? And who is doing that? The state law. This is why we need to change and modify

58:31.960 --> 58:42.280
the inside, but it's not the last of our history, because we need to recover our spirituality.

58:42.440 --> 58:49.560
We need to recover our mother's hair. We don't know the future today,

58:51.400 --> 59:00.200
but we are suffering because what the monoculture and monolingual state and colonial state is doing

59:00.200 --> 59:10.200
with our people. Maybe it's a transitory state, but we are suffering because we don't know the

59:10.520 --> 59:13.080
future. Maybe it's a transitory solution,

59:15.640 --> 59:23.400
because if you put the diversity inside the law, that will change the school.

59:24.840 --> 59:31.480
If you put the language inside the law, we will have the right to listen to the news

59:32.440 --> 59:40.680
on television, in our language, for instance. And that will modify. When I was the first president

59:40.680 --> 59:48.600
of the constitutional process here in Chile, I was speaking mother tongue. And there are a lot

59:48.600 --> 59:55.800
of people that never listened to Aboriginal language. For the first time, they listened

59:55.800 --> 01:00:04.120
to the news on television, by the media, by TV. And that will make an impact, a social impact.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:13.400
And we need those impacts to see we are here, we are alive, because a monocultural,

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:21.160
a monolingual state is denying us. And maybe you have a very strong anarchist movement inside,

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:32.040
or indigenous movement, but we just see ourselves in that movement. But what happened with all of

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:39.800
the society that are thinking that we are Barbaro, that we are not, for instance, here in Chile,

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:50.120
they said that we are a violent people, terrorism. So we need to make

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:57.560
to have the possibility to share with all of the society, because we are not isolated.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.480
And we need to share in the majority of the mentality.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.000
And we are here, we are the 10% of the Chilean society.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:17.720
And when the first referendum about the constitution, 38% give the votes for the

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:28.200
plurality. But what happened with the other? We need to make change inside the mentality of

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:35.480
the majority of the people. And how can we do that? We need the institution, because the

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:46.040
system, political system use the institution in order to modify the conscience of the people.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.360
Today they are not killing directly us, as the conqueror did long time ago.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:11.800
But they are killing us using the institution, church, using media, school, military forces,

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:22.600
cinema, using all of those institutions to support one way of thinking.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.520
So we need to make the plurality inside all of those institutions.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.080
Elisa, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests. And this question is,

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.200
if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:49.720
Yeah, the future must be diverse.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:03:04.040
The future, I really appreciate the pluralism inside person. We need to be a plural person.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:16.600
One language is not enough. So that is very important for the education today. We need to

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:24.600
recover the right for nature. Free lakes, for instance, free river, without pollution,

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:34.840
without pollution, without intervention. So also the women's rights,

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:45.880
because we are able to take our own decision. Why the man have to take the decision for us?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:56.440
It's the same question in indigenous matters, because why white people have to take the decision

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:10.440
for us? We are not children. We are nations. So the future must be better without racism,

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:23.320
without colonialism. And we'll be better respecting mother earth as our mothers.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.800
In my culture, we pray for the nature. We say thanks to the nature.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:40.840
And I believe that if more people do and feel that

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:51.480
the mother nation will recognize us, all of us as their children or their

01:04:51.480 --> 01:05:03.320
sons. So with different values. Society with different values that keep the life for us

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:13.960
and for the diversity, cultural diversity, biological diversity, and also with the

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:22.440
women decision inside the world. Because we have war today.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:34.200
And women, we always keep, we take care, we know how to take care of other people.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:48.200
And when one president, one country does the war, they don't think about children,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:55.640
they don't think about elders, they don't think about the other. Maybe a woman

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:04.920
can think about other, but with other values. I'm not thinking now in Margaret Thatcher,

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:15.320
because he had a patriarchal way of thinking. We need to stop the patriarchalism too.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.920
