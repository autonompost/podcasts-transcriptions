00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and it is my great pleasure to welcome George Mombio in today's episode.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:16,320
He's a prolific author, journalist and activist, and this episode came together through a collaboration with Comunia,

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:25,560
who, together with Bund Jugend, put together an edited volume on the topic of public luxury, a concept coined by George Mombio.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,360
The book is called Ã–ffentlicher Luxus and it was published by the great Karl Dietz Verlag Berlin.

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,360
It's fantastic and you should get it.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,960
If you don't need a physical copy, you'll find a link to the digital version of the full book in the show notes.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,400
Big shout out to Comunia, who are doing absolutely fantastic work in the field of socialization in Germany.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,920
And I am very much looking forward to the upcoming second Vergesellschaftungskonferenz, socialization conference,

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,760
of which Future Histories will be, as it was with the first one, an official media partner.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm very proud.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,640
So more on this soon.

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,520
What you will also find in the show notes is a link to a workshop held by Comunia on the topic of public luxury in February in Vienna.

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,560
I think you can still register to this one.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,960
So if you're interested in the topic, go ahead.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,760
You'll find the link in the show notes and maybe we will see each other there.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,560
Before we start, I would like to welcome Alexander as a patron of Future Histories.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,920
And I want to thank Lukas and Samuel for their donations.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,440
And now please enjoy today's episode with George Mombio on public luxury.

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,280
Welcome, George.

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Hi, how are you doing?

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,840
George, right now it feels like everything is going to shit on multiple levels, actually.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:06,120
And more and more people, I would say, are starting to feel the pressure that the current polycrisis is exerting in their own lives.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:14,040
In these times, a positive and attractive alternative notion of what the future could hold for all of us is very much needed.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:22,240
And not only does it need to be positive, but it crucially also needs to feel possible and tangible, I would say.

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,720
So people will need to hear it and be able to say, yeah, I could imagine that to happen.

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,560
We need to fight for it for sure, but it could happen.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:40,720
So you have used the idea of public luxury as a carrier for such an alternative notion of our collective futures.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,000
Could you maybe explain to us what you mean by that?

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,720
What is public luxury?

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:55,640
The idea comes from the thought that there simply is not enough ecological space or even physical space for everyone to pursue private luxury.

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:05,360
The promise of capitalism and the reason why so many people go along with it and accept this extremely destructive,

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,200
world eating system is that they believe they are temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

33
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,840
They think that one day the finger will point at them because that is a promise.

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,200
The promise is that we can all aspire to private luxury.

35
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,120
That's why we buy into it, literally.

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,840
But we can't. And there's a couple of reasons why we can't.

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,320
The first is that some people can achieve private luxury because they exploit other people.

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,440
The extreme wealth of those who live in luxury is a result of the exploitation of those who don't.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,400
So simply in basic mathematical terms, you can't have everyone at the top.

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:56,000
You know, the promise of capitalism is that everyone can be number one, but there are basic arithmetic reasons why that cannot work.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:08,120
But there's also an even bigger reason, which is that if everyone achieved private luxury, we would burn through the living planet in a matter of days.

42
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:20,760
The ecological footprint of the very rich is massively greater than the footprint of the median or especially the poorer citizens of the world.

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,280
So it's simply impossible to fulfill the promise of capitalism.

44
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,680
And you can't even do it in terms of physical space.

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:38,320
If everyone in London had their own swimming pool and their own tennis court and their own art collection and their own playground for their kids,

46
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,920
then London would occupy a large proportion of England.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,760
Where would everyone else live? England would occupy a large proportion of Europe.

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,440
It's just not enough planet, even in physical terms.

49
00:04:50,440 --> 00:05:06,520
But public luxury, which means magnificent public swimming pools and tennis courts and art collections and playgrounds and public transport and all the other things that people try to achieve with their own money.

50
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,720
But if we achieve it together, not only does that create space for people rather than taking it away from everyone else,

51
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:32,400
but it can also be achieved at much, much lower ecological cost because you need only create one set of tennis courts or one large swimming pool for thousands and thousands of people to use rather than individuating the provision as private luxury does.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,560
And so my call is for what I call private sufficiency, public luxury.

53
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:52,480
I think it's perfectly legitimate for us all to have our own modest private domain, our own modest home and the particular things that we need to lead a decent life within that home.

54
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,920
But if we want to aspire to luxury, we should do it within the public domain.

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,200
That doesn't just mean state provision, incidentally, it can also mean community ownership of resources, which in some cases can be more appropriate.

56
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:16,160
OK, maybe let's dig a little deeper into that and maybe paint a picture that has a bit more detail when it comes to how this might play out for all of us.

57
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Because as you pointed out, there's an upper limit and there's a lower limit.

58
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,800
So what would these lives look like?

59
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,800
What would be examples for public luxury, but also for the sufficiency that we will engage in?

60
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,480
So how much is luxury in the public sphere and how much is sufficiency in the private sphere?

61
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,440
It's hard to draw hard and fast boundaries, not least because the science keeps changing.

62
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,240
We keep discovering, well, how much tighter it's getting every year.

63
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,280
There was a new paper published just two weeks ago showing that we at current levels of emissions,

64
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:03,680
we really have just six years left before we exceed a 50% chance of breaching 1.5 degrees of global heating.

65
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,320
And so there's almost no space left.

66
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,560
We have an extremely tight carbon budget.

67
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,200
Ecological budgets could be even tighter.

68
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:22,360
I mean, we are breaching planetary boundaries left, right and centre, you know, the planetary boundaries framework,

69
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:31,240
which has been established by scientists is very useful, but it's quite crude at the same time because it lumps everything together.

70
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,880
You know, it looks at novel substances, for instance, or it looks at biodiversity loss or it looks at land use transformation.

71
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,960
But these things within them, there are thousands of different ecosystems and thousands of different impacts taking place.

72
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:58,360
And when you break it down in a more granular way, you see that we are just on the cusp of pushing loads of ecosystems past their tipping points.

73
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:06,160
If you look at what's going on in marine systems, for instance, combination of industrial fishing, of pollution,

74
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,440
of global heating and the acidification of the seas, it's already destroying tropical coral reefs.

75
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,400
It's destroying entire ecosystems.

76
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,240
We've seen it with the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.

77
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,880
You know, people say it's fisheries collapse.

78
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,240
It's not ecosystem collapse.

79
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,600
We see it again and again and again, cascading collapse all over marine systems.

80
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:36,200
We've seen it very similarly in many terrestrial systems, perhaps the most dangerous of which from the human point of view is the collapse of soil.

81
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Ninety nine percent of our calories come from the soil.

82
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,400
And basically, in all these cases, the more we know, the worse the situation looks.

83
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,360
So the tighter the budget has to be.

84
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:59,640
A few years ago, people were saying, well, the sustainable budget for carbon emissions or greenhouse gas emissions is equivalent to two tons of carbon per person per year.

85
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,200
It's a lot tighter than that now.

86
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,880
I haven't seen a calculation published in 2023, but it's almost certainly below one ton.

87
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:25,800
And yet the one percent on average are using 70 tons of carbon per year, whereas billionaires on average use about seven thousand tons to in some cases, 20 or 30 thousand tons of carbon per year.

88
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,520
Now, you know, let's go back to the promise of capitalism is that we're all going to be those people one day.

89
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,920
Well, how is that possible?

90
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:44,080
It just can't be done. You can't all run private jets and super yachts and giga homes and all the other appurtenances of being a billionaire.

91
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,840
So it's all we can say for sure is that it's really, really tight and it's probably tighter even than we think.

92
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,800
We're in emergency mode now.

93
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:03,520
And of course, that's a very dangerous situation politically as well as ecologically, because it means we're hitting political cliff edges.

94
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,640
And we've seen in the Netherlands what happens when you hit that cliff edge.

95
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:20,000
So scientists have been warning in the Netherlands that it had a nitrate crisis from the 1980s onwards, but the successive governments were very slow to act.

96
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:28,560
They didn't put in the measures which could have addressed that problem slowly and painlessly,

97
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:39,560
where every year you can just dial it down a little bit until you get below the limits you need to reach in order not to cause ecosystem collapse.

98
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:47,520
But because governments kept kicking the ball forward to the next administration and the next one and the next one, it's not my problem.

99
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,160
It's within the next four or five years, it's not going to mature as a problem, so we can just leave it.

100
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You get to a situation where suddenly there's a legal challenge.

101
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,960
It's breaking European law.

102
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:15,520
The State Council says you have to take action and you have to go from a situation of massive nitrate pollution to very little nitrate pollution within an extremely short space of time.

103
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:23,760
And that means taking quite drastic political action, including saying we're going to have to shut down certain livestock operations.

104
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,320
And that then triggers a massive political backlash, as we've seen.

105
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:36,840
And what I fear is that we're going to see very similar situations on one ecological issue after another.

106
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,200
But because governments all around the world have failed to take action, if we're going to stop Earth systems from tipping,

107
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:51,000
they're going to have to take very sudden and very drastic action, and that will trigger a massive political backlash.

108
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,280
And they know that, so they're not going to take it.

109
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:06,680
And rather than face the prospect of losing office, they prefer to face the prospect of losing Earth systems, of creating basically an uninhabitable planet.

110
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,160
So we're not in a good place.

111
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,840
You know, always when we're discussing these issues, you say, well, I wouldn't start from here.

112
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,520
But unfortunately, we don't have much choice about that.

113
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,840
This is where we are. It's a bad place.

114
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,280
And just just to add to this, I hope you don't mind me sort of riffing on this a bit,

115
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,560
because it's uppermost in my mind at the moment because of the dire situation we're in in the UK.

116
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,680
And the UK is a very good example of how badly wrong things can go, even in an extremely rich nation,

117
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,760
a nation which has been exploiting much of the world for centuries, harvested a huge amount of money and wealth,

118
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:56,360
and yet is now facing extreme social dislocation, extreme poverty and the collapse of public services.

119
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,320
And that's the result of 40 years of neoliberalism.

120
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,840
We call it different things.

121
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,000
Some people say, oh, it's Thatcherism, it's Reaganism, it's austerity, it's trussonomics.

122
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,960
There's all these sort of individuated names for what it is, but it's not.

123
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,640
It's the same doctrine which has been pursued now for about 40 years.

124
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,600
And the result is that we have massive funding deficits in just about every single public sector.

125
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,160
So in some of them, they are quite clearly estimated in the National Health Service, for instance.

126
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,440
It's a 200 billion pound deficit since the Conservatives came back into office in 2010.

127
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,760
For sewerage, it's about 600 billion.

128
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:48,920
The rest of the water system would probably take that up to around a trillion pounds that need to be spent to get a 21st century water and sewage system in this country.

129
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:57,960
We've got a crisis of school buildings collapsing because they were built with inferior materials and they weren't designed to last and they've never been upgraded.

130
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,280
There hasn't been a full school rebuilding program for a long time.

131
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,960
That would be a few more hundred billion to resolve.

132
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,320
Similarly, with a lot of domestic buildings, we now see big tower blocks in danger of collapse.

133
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,200
We still see them covered in flammable cladding, which could cause more Grenfell tower disasters.

134
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,000
We've got a massive deficit in the provision of social housing, probably another trillion or so.

135
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:37,720
You start adding it up and you are talking many trillions of pounds of spending if we are to just sort of get back to a situation in which there is general provision for the people in this country.

136
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,400
So it is a very dire situation.

137
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,800
We have this great crunch coming.

138
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
We've got the ecological crunch.

139
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,640
People talk about a climate crisis.

140
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,800
It's an Earth systems crisis as every single Earth system now is heading towards tipping points.

141
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:07,800
And we have a massive fiscal crunch as a result of these years and years and years of neoliberal austerity, cutting public services and diverting the money instead into the pockets of the very rich.

142
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:19,240
And at the same time, we have a number of other global crises which we are completely failing to address, like, for instance, the food crisis.

143
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,120
And we didn't really have much of a food crisis until recently because it all looked as if it was heading in the right direction.

144
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:36,800
There were quite strong hopes that we were going to meet sustainable development goal 2.1, which is eliminating global hunger by 2030.

145
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,440
The trend was heading clearly in that direction from the 1960s until 2014.

146
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,520
There was a very steep decline in global hunger.

147
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,160
It was looking great.

148
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,320
And then in 2015, it started ticking up again.

149
00:15:50,320 --> 00:16:02,000
And now we've already lost about 10 years of that progress because there's an extra 120 million people hungry now, even by comparison to 2019.

150
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,440
It's a really, really frightening situation.

151
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:21,720
And what we could be seeing on top of everything else is systemic global food system failure, similar to the failure of the financial system in 2008, which was just about to collapse before it was bailed out with massive government spending.

152
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,680
Can we bail out the food system?

153
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,440
They managed to save the financial system by inventing future money.

154
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,320
Quantitative easing was the creation of future money.

155
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,920
You can't save the food system by creating future food.

156
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,400
So we've got all these massive converging crises.

157
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,840
You talk of a poly crisis, you're quite right to do so.

158
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,640
But I think it's even bigger, much, much bigger than most people assume.

159
00:16:45,640 --> 00:17:00,880
So, you know, I know we're trying to be optimistic here and we will come to this, but we just have to accept the reality of how blinking difficult this is, of how many things are all converging at the same time

160
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:15,640
and how we will look back to the past 60 or 70 years, well, really since about 1945 as being a golden era by comparison to everything that will follow.

161
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,600
There is no repeating that time.

162
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,360
We burnt through resources at a phenomenal rate.

163
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,400
We can't do that anymore.

164
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,000
That helped generate a great deal of liquid wealth with which we were able to build public services.

165
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,280
But that then was reversed deliberately and very effectively through the neoliberal era from about 1979 onwards.

166
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,200
And and the deficits are such that we will never, ever plug those holes.

167
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,440
We won't get to back to the era of generalized prosperity that we had before that we just have to accept.

168
00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:01,840
So we have to make the best of a very difficult and shall we say suboptimal situation and we have very little time in which to do it.

169
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:14,480
And so as a result of that, we have to use all remaining available resources, planetary and financial, as efficiently and parsimoniously as we possibly can.

170
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,120
And that is a very powerful reason, I believe, for pursuing public luxury rather than private luxury.

171
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:29,800
Right. And I think also it's an important point when it comes to this political question that you addressed, because we will have to get people on board.

172
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:37,760
And you stated that the form of luxury that we had here in the West for some time now will have to have an end.

173
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:51,400
But at the same time, it's equally in a reality that for most of the people globally, the form of public luxury that you're envisioning is very much a better living standard.

174
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,640
So there is a very attractive offer encapsulated in this idea of public luxury.

175
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:09,400
And I'm very curious about this offer, because I think while it is super important to point out the urgency and the factor of disaster that is happening in front of our eyes,

176
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,120
as you did right now, it's equally important to point out that there is something to gain for the many.

177
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,720
And this is, as I understand it, this idea of public luxury.

178
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:33,640
So maybe we could get into what this actually might entail, because there's also this framework of universal basic services, for example, floating around, which is quite similar in a certain sense.

179
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:41,240
So what would be covered through public luxury? And would it be unconditional? Because this is also quite attractive.

180
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:51,120
Yes, yes. So the first thing I want to say is that I don't want my proposals to compete in any way with other proposals such as universal basic services.

181
00:19:51,120 --> 00:20:01,600
I think they're totally compatible. I think they they're complementary to each other, because, as the name suggests, universal basic services is not really in the business of supplying luxuries,

182
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:13,080
but it's in the business of making sure that our necessities are met and that everyone has free access to those necessities, which is obviously an absolutely essential component.

183
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:21,480
And so I guess you would really say, actually, we need three things. We need private sufficiency, we need universal basic services, and we need public luxury.

184
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,600
And I don't want to sort of bundle those basic services into public luxury, because they are slightly different things.

185
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:37,000
And public luxury obviously is not unlimited, because there will always be limitations on what we can do, and we have to accept those limitations.

186
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:50,520
And in fact, accepting limitations, the idea of we can have enough and then we can stop when we've got enough, I think is absolutely essential to being responsible 21st century citizens

187
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,000
and to ensuring that you can have realistic political aims.

188
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:08,680
So that's quite an important component of it, is to say, don't expect the moon on a stick, but do expect the one habitable planet that we know of to be habitable for everyone,

189
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,200
and that everyone can have a decent quality of life, but not a massive quantity of life.

190
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,280
That's really the promise we should be making to ourselves and to everyone else.

191
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:30,400
So what would it look like? Well, if we look at the public domain, for instance, one of the first things, the most visible thing, the most obvious thing,

192
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:40,120
and perhaps the most important thing that you need to be looking at is land, is who controls it, who has access to it, who's using it, and for what purposes?

193
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,240
These are really important questions and perennially neglected in politics.

194
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:57,600
Land is, oh, well, that's the place where you put houses, and obviously we need houses and we need to allocate land carefully and we need farming and lots of other things.

195
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,840
But we also, to create anything like a high quality of human life and viable communities, you need public land.

196
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:16,280
You need land that everyone can use, land that everyone can enjoy, land where they can meet each other, land where they can exercise, land where they can have fun,

197
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:26,000
all the things which make our lives worth living happen in that public domain, and the public domain has to have a physical base to it.

198
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,960
And I'm not saying that it's all going to be open land, there needs to be land in which you can build public buildings and do indoor activities,

199
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:45,440
which are luxurious and which enhance our quality of life, such as a luxurious indoor swimming pool, for instance, and other great community facilities that you can envisage.

200
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:56,400
But it's allocating that land is really at the core of it, and to say we are setting aside land which cannot be captured by private interests,

201
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:05,760
which cannot be enclosed, to use the old term of the capture of land by private interests, and will belong to the public.

202
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,840
And as I said before, that doesn't necessarily mean the state.

203
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,320
In many cases, it's far more appropriate that it belongs to the community and becomes a commons.

204
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,560
And a commons really is at the core of this.

205
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,120
Commons is a crucial, neglected sphere of the economy.

206
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:32,000
It's not private, it's not state, it's not capitalist, it's not communist, it's a different sphere altogether.

207
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,160
A commons is a resource which is managed by a community.

208
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:48,400
Nobody owns it definitively because you have a duty to pass it down to future generations in the same or better state in which you found it.

209
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:56,400
It's either the resource itself or the output of the resource is shared equally between the members of the community,

210
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,320
and it creates benefits for everyone who is involved in it.

211
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,840
And we have some very good examples in all over Europe, the public park, which is owned by communities.

212
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:16,240
There are some, some of them are mostly state controlled, but community owned parks are a great example of a land based commons.

213
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:23,320
In the UK, we have a system called allotments where land is set aside for people to grow food on.

214
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,000
And this was, it was basically a sort of substitute for the proper land reform that we needed in this country.

215
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,800
It was a bit of a sop.

216
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,640
We say, OK, we've taken most of the land away from you, we'll give a little bit back so that you can feel it hasn't all gone.

217
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,880
And actually, these allotments have turned out to be really important for people's wellbeing.

218
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:52,400
I had an allotment for a long time in the previous place I lived in, and I don't know how I would have coped without it.

219
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,520
It was really important for my mental health, but also for my connections with the community.

220
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,840
So this was an area of land.

221
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:10,040
It was, could only have been about three, four hectares, maybe it divided into 200 little plots, each of which was calculated,

222
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,920
estimated to be the amount of land from which a family could provide itself with vegetables.

223
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,280
That's basically what the size of the plot was based on.

224
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,760
And so, yeah, 220 in total, 220 plots in this.

225
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,840
And all of them quite intensely cultivated and some of them very productive, some more successful than others,

226
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,120
but producing really quite a large amount of food for the amount of land involved.

227
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,800
I mean, just a small proportion of the city's food, obviously, because there's only small amounts of land handed over.

228
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:52,600
But on that allotment, it was controlled entirely by the allotment holders.

229
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:00,520
So you had a members association of the 220 allotment holders who would make the decisions as to how the land was used and allocated.

230
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,560
It was technically owned by the council, but we actually had rights in perpetuity.

231
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:15,520
So there was a sort of co-ownership with the council and it was controlled entirely by its own members, which is a crucial aspect of the Commons.

232
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:24,480
And what it did, apart from giving you this outdoor space where it was yours, but not just yours,

233
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,400
and it was almost like having a garden which you couldn't otherwise afford with your small house.

234
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,240
It also introduced you to communities you might never otherwise have met.

235
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,080
And one of the amazing features of this was that across those 220 plots,

236
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,120
there were people who must have come from about 30 or 40 countries of origin from all over the world.

237
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,000
It was quite extraordinary, the amazing diversity of languages, of experiences, of stories.

238
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,440
And you meet each other on equal terms because you've all got the same amount of land.

239
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,160
You're all struggling with similar constraints.

240
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,560
You've got the problems with the weather, you've got pests, you've got issues with soil, whatever.

241
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:17,640
And so you're constantly swapping expertise, giving seeds to each other, swapping produce.

242
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,800
The people on the plot next door to me were Serbian refugees.

243
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,480
And they really loved the plums and medlars that I was growing on my allotment.

244
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,840
And we had a massive surplus of plums.

245
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,680
We couldn't eat them all ourselves.

246
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,840
And we never quite got the hang of cooking with medlars.

247
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,800
But in the Balkans, medlars, this quite obscure fruit, are very, very popular.

248
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,480
And so we gave them our medlars and quite a few of our plums and some of our apples.

249
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
And they gave us some wonderful vegetables, beans and potatoes and chard

250
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,520
and other things that they were growing.

251
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,160
And we learned quite a lot from each other, not just about growing, but about cooking.

252
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,400
But then also, we told our stories.

253
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,920
So you can see how land can instantly start to bring people together.

254
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,200
And food can bring people together as well.

255
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,080
And the word companion comes from the Latin companes, with bread.

256
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,960
And a companion is someone with whom you break bread.

257
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,520
And so having places in which you can have community meals,

258
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,160
luxurious community meals, where you can all come together,

259
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,360
prepare something together, eat it together.

260
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,720
Instead of going to a fancy restaurant, you effectively create in the public domain

261
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,400
the equivalent of a fancy restaurant, which is much, much cheaper and is not exclusive.

262
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,960
That's the key thing, that fancy restaurants, of course, are exclusive.

263
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
Only a small proportion of the population could afford to eat there.

264
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,000
But everyone can afford to have luxurious community meals,

265
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,760
where you get together in a common space.

266
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,640
I think we kind of get to a point where a certain question needs to be answered,

267
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,280
because you already pointed towards the commons as a really crucial element in this.

268
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,040
And you pointed towards the inefficiency as well as the excluding element of private property,

269
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,800
because private property is not able to produce this type of community that you're right now talking about.

270
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,840
So if we're talking about land reform, and we should, as you rightly stated,

271
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:35,000
so then we will get into a conflict with those who right now own this land as private property.

272
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,640
So there will be some kind of conflict to be had in order to get to this state

273
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,000
where things are held in common as commons.

274
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,840
So I would be interested because this is also, of course, an element of public luxury.

275
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,160
You have this private sufficiency, which means, of course, many will gain a lot.

276
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,520
And this will be super attractive, hopefully for the many.

277
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,560
But there are the few who will lose out, and they should.

278
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,040
But right now, as it happens, those are the people who have the political power,

279
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,680
they have the economic power.

280
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,680
And I'm sorry, but I have to add they have also the military power.

281
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,600
And if we think of something like the democratic socialism of Salvador Allende and how this played out,

282
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,440
we will have to think about this as well.

283
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:33,440
So how do we get to a point where we will be able to implement this type of sharing in common,

284
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,600
which will lead to us sustaining the planet in a way that is actually sustaining it?

285
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,480
Yes, thanks. Again, we have to concede all this is very difficult.

286
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,720
You know, if I were to come on this podcast and say, yeah, it's easy, we just do it like this,

287
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,600
then I would be lying to you.

288
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,000
You know, we're up against a lot of constraints, not least because, as you so rightly say,

289
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,720
they have the resources and they have the power.

290
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,440
And this hasn't come about by accident.

291
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,560
Part of the whole point of neoliberalism was to turn economic power into political power,

292
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,760
to return to a situation of plutocracy, to displace democracy.

293
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,600
That was very much a thrust of it.

294
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,280
William Davis at Goldsmith College has a lovely definition of neoliberalism,

295
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,600
which is the disenchantment of politics by economics.

296
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,440
And it's basically it was an assault on democracy.

297
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,720
I mean, democracy is a problem that capitalism is always trying to solve.

298
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,080
And neoliberal ideology is a very effective means of solving that problem.

299
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,600
And what we've seen worldwide is power being sucked out of democratic institutions.

300
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,560
They've been hollowed out, as Professor Colin Crouch has argued.

301
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,680
And you end up with a kind of neutron bomb politics where you've still got the institution

302
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,400
standing, you've still got the buildings, you've still got the protocols, you've still got

303
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,360
parliament sitting and talking.

304
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,560
But actually, power has bled away into other spheres.

305
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,480
It's gone into private discussions between governments and oligarchs.

306
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,440
It's gone offshore, like the offshore arbitration tribunals, the investor state dispute settlement

307
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,080
mechanisms, which basically override democratic decision making.

308
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,800
Corporations can sue states for decisions they don't like, and those states are forced

309
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,840
to hand over billions and billions of dollars because they've upset corporate plans for

310
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,120
making vast amounts of money.

311
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:39,840
There's lots of ways in which power has been bled out, sucked away from citizens and handed

312
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,800
over to oligarchs, plutocrats, kleptocrats around the world.

313
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,040
When neoliberals say, let the market decide, we should examine what that thing, the market

314
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
means.

315
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,200
It's basically let the money decide.

316
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,600
And when you let the money decide, you let the people with the most money decide.

317
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,360
It's basically saying, let the plutocrats decide.

318
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,580
That's what it really means.

319
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,400
And that's what has been happening.

320
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,880
And they have gained power immensely at our expense.

321
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,760
You mentioned Salvador Allende.

322
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:17,600
That was done in a very crude way, a military coup supported by not just Western governments,

323
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,720
but the neoliberal economists trained specifically for what turned into Pinochet's economics

324
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,840
at the University of Chicago and elsewhere, and implemented the full neoliberal agenda

325
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,560
there following the coup.

326
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,240
But it's been done more subtly and slowly in other nations where it would be harder

327
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,520
to overthrow them with a coup, but with similar end results.

328
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:49,000
It's a bit like the famous phrase in Africa, when the white man came to Africa, we had

329
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,940
the land and he had the Bible.

330
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,060
He told us to close our eyes and pray, and when we opened them, he had the land and we

331
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,500
had the Bible.

332
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,820
And it's a bit like that with neoliberalism.

333
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,780
You can say that.

334
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,980
When the neoliberals turned up, we had the public sphere.

335
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,500
We were in control of politics.

336
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,900
And they had the road to serfdom and the constitution of liberty.

337
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,260
They told us to close our eyes, grab hold of these books, and by the time we opened

338
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,380
them, they had everything.

339
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:25,660
And to hell with the supposed neoliberal principles in those books, it was socialism

340
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,500
for the rich and neoliberalism for the poor.

341
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,020
And so again, we're in a very difficult position where we have to displace that existing power

342
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:43,620
in order to return both to democracy and to a lively public sphere, and that includes

343
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
land.

344
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:51,180
Now, there are plenty of nonviolent mechanisms of doing this, and taxation is the most obvious

345
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
one.

346
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:57,540
You start introducing land taxes, you make it expensive for people to own large tracts

347
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:06,060
of land which could be in the public domain, and you can start to push it in a more democratic

348
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,100
direction.

349
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,540
But as you say, people are going to resist this, and people with the power will resist

350
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
this very hard.

351
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,900
The only thing that is in our favor is that we are many and they are few.

352
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,260
They might have the money, they might have the media, they might have the era of government,

353
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,780
they might have the weapons.

354
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,740
It does require massive, massive mobilization.

355
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,560
And we've seen there are many instances in history where mass mobilization overturned

356
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,700
extremely rigid power structures.

357
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,460
I think that society is a complex system, right?

358
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,500
And all complex systems have equilibrium states and they have tipping points, and they can

359
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,940
tip from one equilibrium state into a different equilibrium state.

360
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,700
And society, I believe, has two equilibrium states.

361
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,420
One is impossible, the other is inevitable.

362
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,820
And at any one time, you say your situation is impossible.

363
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,020
It appears to be impossible.

364
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:09,220
If you looked at women's suffrage, for instance, if you went to the 1890s in most parts of

365
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,620
Europe and said, will women ever have the vote?

366
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
Impossible.

367
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,420
It's just not going to happen.

368
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,380
The patriarchal system is simply too powerful.

369
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,260
The men are never going to give up 50% of their power.

370
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,420
How is that ever going to happen?

371
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,860
It's just impossible.

372
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,900
And within a few decades, it became inevitable.

373
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,140
Once it had happened, you look back and say, well, of course that was going to happen.

374
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,220
How can that not happen?

375
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,180
And the same goes, for instance, with gay rights and equal marriage.

376
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:43,540
In the 1980s, if you'd said, what are the prospects across Western Europe for equal

377
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,780
marriage?

378
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,460
Equal marriage legislation passed by governments, impossible.

379
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,180
Society is homophobic.

380
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,360
Homophobia has been there for centuries.

381
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,460
It's just part of how society is.

382
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,500
We're up against the conservatives.

383
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,780
We're up against the church.

384
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,580
We're up against all these massive forces in society.

385
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,980
Then a few decades later, well, of course that was going to happen.

386
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
It's inevitable.

387
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,340
Same with abortion, same with certain aspects of women's liberation, obviously still a long

388
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,540
way to go.

389
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,020
Same with smoking.

390
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:22,380
When I was in my 20s, quite a long time ago, every public space was just a fog of blue

391
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,980
smoke.

392
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,500
And now in my country, if you see anyone smoking, it's like they're at high school again, hiding

393
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
behind the dustbins.

394
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,580
It's furtively taking a cigarette.

395
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,020
We see these tipping points have happened again and again and again, and in every case,

396
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,860
they've gone from impossible to inevitable.

397
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,220
It can't happen.

398
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,500
It was bound to happen.

399
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,220
Those are the two equilibrium states for any issue in society, and they tip.

400
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:57,860
So it's very easy to create a completely pessimistic picture and say, that can't possibly happen.

401
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,980
What I sketched out at the beginning sounded pretty pessimistic, but that's only because

402
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,140
we are always trapped within our moment.

403
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,900
We conceive the future as repeated instances of the present, and we imagine it can't possibly

404
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
change.

405
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:19,900
But that's because we tend to regard society as if it were a simple system and not a complex

406
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
system.

407
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,140
And this is, I think, one of the greatest deficits in our education.

408
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:31,100
So few of us are ever taught in school or even in university about how complex systems

409
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,180
function.

410
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,020
We're taught about complex systems.

411
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,300
We're taught about ecosystems.

412
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,980
We're taught about social systems, but we're taught about them as if they were simple systems,

413
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,660
like circuit diagrams, as if it were an electrical circuit or a plumbing map.

414
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,020
This is how the economy works.

415
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,140
This is how an ecosystem works.

416
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,660
But actually, it just doesn't work that way.

417
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,260
It works in completely different ways to a simple system.

418
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:02,500
Change does not happen in linear and gradual ways in a complex system.

419
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,900
It tends to absorb change, absorb change, absorb change, and during that whole time

420
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,380
it plateaus and you think, nothing's going to change.

421
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
This is just how it is.

422
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,420
And then suddenly, bang, it tips into a different state.

423
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,180
So this is absolutely not a council of despair.

424
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,780
At any moment in history, you would seem to have very good reasons for despair.

425
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,900
And then a few years later, you say, why was anybody despairing about that?

426
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
Of course it was going to happen.

427
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Yeah.

428
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:37,460
And I for once am absolutely in the camp of alternative desirable futures can definitely

429
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,580
happen and actually they must happen or it will be barbarism for sure.

430
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,940
So you would not have to convince me, but I have to add that the examples that you gave

431
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:59,420
me, like gay rights or voting and stuff like that, that these are examples that are quite

432
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:05,340
a bit different from a crucial topic that will need to be addressed, which is property.

433
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,860
So we have been there before in our conversation and I think there's a really good question

434
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:20,020
that you asked within your text, which should be quite obvious, but which is so ingrained

435
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,580
in the form of naturalization of private property that people tend to not ask it.

436
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:31,860
And you ask, what gives you the right to appropriate parts of nature just because you have money?

437
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:37,180
So there's no intrinsic connection between the two actually, but in our societies, people

438
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,420
tend to believe there is, but it isn't.

439
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:47,180
So if we acknowledge this, that there is no intrinsic connection whatsoever between the

440
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:56,100
two, then we would get to a place where the whole way in which we engage with nature,

441
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:03,420
the let's say socio-metabolic mechanism that we set up for our social relation with nature,

442
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:10,060
that this will need to be based on fundamentally different paradigms, so to speak, not paradigms

443
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:17,460
that derive rights of nature abuse from money and private property, but they will have to

444
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,060
be enacted in a very different way.

445
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:27,300
And there is a, I think, interesting and very much related research strand around questions

446
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,380
of democratic economic planning or democratic planning in a more broader sense that I think

447
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,300
would be a very fruitful ally in this.

448
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,620
And I would be interested if this is something that you engage with, because if we say that

449
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,980
money should, and markets for that matter, should not be the steering mechanism or at

450
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:54,060
least the dominant steering mechanism through which this relation is mediated, then the

451
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,220
question comes up, what should it be then?

452
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,660
What would be the alternative?

453
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,100
And of course, the first thing that comes up is it should be democratic, but then the

454
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,820
questions actually come up even more.

455
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,260
So I would be interested, what is your thinking around these questions?

456
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,220
Because they are so crucial and the heart of the whole thing, I would say.

457
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,660
Yeah, no, all good and absolutely crucial questions.

458
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,700
I would actually say they're not that different from the women's suffrage question, because

459
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:29,460
if you go back to the 19th century, it was just an absolutely implicit plank of political

460
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,100
systems that men should control and even own women.

461
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:38,660
There were legal instruments giving men effective ownership over women and ownership over all

462
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,500
their resources, ownership of their decision-making, all of that.

463
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,300
And it was just for the great part of society unquestioned, that was just the way it was.

464
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:56,340
And just as there is no intrinsic connection between the numbers in your bank account and

465
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,780
your right to own vast tracts of natural wealth, there was no intrinsic connection

466
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,460
between being male and your right to own and control women.

467
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,700
But those things were assumed to be one and the same.

468
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,620
And so, sorry, go on, yeah.

469
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:16,300
No, just to clarify this, I think for me, the difference is that women's right to vote

470
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,900
could be easily integrated into capitalism, as well as gay rights could be.

471
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:28,980
So this is something that can be included in a way that will make sure that still certain

472
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,200
elements will not be touched.

473
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,860
And one of these elements that should not be touched through the eyes of capitalism

474
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,420
is the question of property rights.

475
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Yes.

476
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
Well, that's true.

477
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,520
But then they could not be integrated into patriarchy, which was another immensely powerful

478
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,780
force where it said there's all sorts of untouchables here.

479
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:52,620
So all I'm saying is there's no reason to despair because these are completely different

480
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,620
questions.

481
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,540
It was just as implausible a few decades before it happened that women would get the vote

482
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:06,700
as it is that we could have a democratic use of property and a democratized economy.

483
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,380
And the necessity, the urgency is just as great.

484
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,620
And the barriers are, I think, probably no greater than the barriers that women faced.

485
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,220
And that might sound ridiculous because the barriers seem enormous, but from the perspective

486
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,620
of women in the late 19th century, those barriers were just as great.

487
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,940
It was just as impossible.

488
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,260
And so we are in the impossible equilibrium state, but there is an inevitable equilibrium

489
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,860
state as well, which can be reached.

490
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,940
Now the question is, can it be reached without crisis?

491
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Almost certainly not.

492
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:49,180
There will be crises which both will be extremely tough, but also create opportunities for changing

493
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,420
things and for saying, well, this system does not work.

494
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,700
How much more obvious can it be that this system does not work?

495
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:06,540
And yes, what we have to do is to challenge something as fundamental to social conditioning

496
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,560
as patriarchy was.

497
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,720
And that fundamental thing we have to challenge is that some people have more right to the

498
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,840
world's natural wealth than other people have.

499
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,720
And there's absolutely no principle, no sound principle, which says that some people should

500
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,840
have that right, should have a greater right than others to natural wealth.

501
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:35,760
But it's just an assumption which is soaked into society in exactly the same way that

502
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,960
the assumption that men should have control over women was soaked into society.

503
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,680
So impossible things can change and can then become inevitable.

504
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm sorry to keep repeating myself on this, but it's such an important thing for people

505
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,520
to grasp.

506
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,040
But your situation now doesn't have to be your situation in the future.

507
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,160
I would like to get a bit of a better sense of what the political imaginary, the broader

508
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,120
political imaginary is that you situate public luxury within.

509
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,880
Because I mean, you pointed towards the commons and you stated it's not markets, it's not

510
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,880
communism either, you stated.

511
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,680
So you kind of draw some kind of line there, I guess, or something like that.

512
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,960
But I would be interested in who would be the ally with which something like that would

513
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
be possible.

514
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,360
I live in Vienna and we have a strong social democratic basis here in Vienna, of course,

515
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,360
and we have some form of public luxury, at least in some parts of our lives.

516
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,800
And I really very much appreciate, I have to say.

517
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,680
But at the same time, social democracy historically has a certain tendency to kind of part with

518
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:02,840
capital or to have a pact with capital when it comes to crucial moments within our history.

519
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,560
So my interest would be to hear something about the political imaginary and also the,

520
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,200
let's say, maybe political platform that you imagine as a carrier through which public

521
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,640
luxury can come about.

522
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:24,160
So I'm very interested in the ideas of Murray Bookchin and his social ecology thinking.

523
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,880
I don't think he's got quite all the answers, but I think there's quite a lot in there about

524
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,240
how you can create political systems which are distributive by design, as Kate Rayworth

525
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
would say.

526
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,720
I mean, I don't know what her relationship with Murray Bookchin is, but she uses a very

527
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,840
important phrase, distributive by design, and that's what Murray Bookchin does with

528
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
his political thinking.

529
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,200
I mean, he's no longer alive, but he had a great influence over some people's political

530
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,200
development.

531
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,240
The most obvious example of that is Rojava in the sort of semi-autonomous region in northeastern

532
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,960
Syria where under extreme difficulty, attacks from all sides really, the local people of

533
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,320
Rojava have created a totally different political system to the one that we have.

534
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,000
Now, the political system, the majority of those of us who live in so-called democratic

535
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,040
systems have works like this.

536
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Every four or five years, you put a cross on a piece of paper, and then you are deemed

537
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,360
to consent to everything that the winning side does in the next four or five years.

538
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,340
So anything that's in their manifesto, their platform that they campaigned on, you're deemed

539
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,740
to have consented to that.

540
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,480
Even if you didn't even vote for them, even if the people who did vote for them hadn't

541
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,160
actually read the manifesto, even if actually they were voting on just one issue, as most

542
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,680
people do, you know, it's like the economy or it's crime or something like that, you're

543
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,760
deemed to have consented to all the other issues in that manifesto and then to consent

544
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,800
to everything else that government chooses to do until you voted out of office in four

545
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
or five years.

546
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,280
In other words, the entire system is based on the principle of presumed consent.

547
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,320
Now, we don't accept presumed consent in sex.

548
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,480
Why should we accept it in politics?

549
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,880
But that is what our so-called democracies do.

550
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,840
But there's a completely different way of doing it, which is a bottom up way of doing

551
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,640
it. And instead of grand decisions being made by a tiny number of people and then passed

552
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,360
down to everyone else with this ridiculous system based on presumed consent, you have

553
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,520
a system where the people make the decisions and pass those on up to ensure that they're

554
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,600
implemented at the wider level.

555
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,560
And that's a system which Bookchin partly designed and which has been developed in

556
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,800
Rojava. But also, you see elements of it in other parts of the world.

557
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,200
And a classic example of that is in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, where between

558
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:02,680
particularly the years 1989 and 2004, over that 15 years when there was a PTA, Partido

559
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:09,360
dos Revalidores, government in Porto Alegre, they handed control of the municipal budget

560
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,840
over to the people. Porto Alegre had been one of the poorest places in Brazil because

561
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,840
it was more or less owned by the mafia.

562
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,040
It was completely dominated by corruption and clientelism.

563
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,280
When public money was spent, it was spent to favour your brother-in-law or the godfather

564
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,600
of this clan or whoever it might be.

565
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,120
And it was just wasted, completely frittered away.

566
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:40,000
By the time participatory budgeting had bedded in, Porto Alegre was number one in the

567
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,280
Human Development Index of all cities in Brazil.

568
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,120
And there'd been a total transformation of its fortunes, massive decline in maternal

569
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,680
mortality, massive decline in infant mortality, massively improved primary health care,

570
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,480
education, sanitation and clean water, public transport.

571
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,880
Because the people were making the decisions, the entire discretionary municipal budget

572
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,400
was in their hands. And every year about 50,000 people came together to decide how it was

573
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,840
spent. And there was a very clever design for passing up those decisions and for making

574
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,960
sure that the poorer areas didn't lose out.

575
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,400
There was a sort of ratio system so that the budget was distributed according to need,

576
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,600
but the decisions over the budget were made by local people.

577
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,880
And it just completely turned the city around.

578
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,280
And it ended up with the extraordinary result, which any political scientist would tell you

579
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:44,120
is impossible, of people taking to the streets and demonstrating to demand that their taxes

580
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,640
were raised. And the reason for that was that they could see that if they spent the money

581
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,120
together, it went a lot further than if they tried to spend it individually.

582
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,080
So, for instance, if you're trying to get to work in the morning and you're using private

583
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:04,400
transport, you might pay $2,000 for a clapped out old car and then be stuck in a traffic

584
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,480
jam for an hour on the way in and an hour on the way out.

585
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:14,760
Or you can contribute $100 a year for a modern, efficient public tram system or monorail or

586
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,560
whatever it might be and get there in 20 minutes rather than an hour.

587
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:23,160
Your money goes much, much further when you're spending it in the public domain.

588
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,080
And people saw that and acted on it.

589
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,960
And what we saw is that when the people are in charge, the decisions are much greener,

590
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,960
they're much fairer, they're much more egalitarian, and they're much more wide ranging than when

591
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,200
you've got a small group in charge who are deemed to be our democratic representatives.

592
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:48,280
Now, I think where I differ from Bookchin is that I think we need some representative

593
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:55,440
democracy as well, because there are certain decisions which it's very hard for participatory

594
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,640
democracy to make.

595
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,760
For instance, in terms of international policy, what do we do about climate policy?

596
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,480
What do we do about disarmament policy, for instance?

597
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,560
What do we do about trade policy?

598
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:14,080
It's very hard to pass it all the way up from the local borough or village level right up

599
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,360
to the global level like that.

600
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,800
So we need some intermediation as well.

601
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,360
But any decision which can be made locally should be made locally.

602
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,360
Everything should be devolved as much as possible.

603
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,440
But there are limits to that devolution.

604
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,480
So I would see a hybrid system.

605
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,040
But obviously, when you've got this mass participation, one of the things it does is it

606
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,200
transforms people.

607
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,720
It makes them into democratic citizens.

608
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,200
They realize that they should be in charge.

609
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,200
There's not a luxury to have genuine democratic engagement.

610
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,520
It's actually a necessity if you're going to have a good society.

611
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,880
And it's our right.

612
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,720
It's our right to have deliberative participatory politics rather than decisions handed down

613
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,680
from on high in the name of representative democracy.

614
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,380
And in fact, one of the fascinating aspects of participatory democracy is that it works

615
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,600
better in practice than it does in theory.

616
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,040
You have endless people saying, oh, that couldn't possibly work.

617
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
People wouldn't be like that.

618
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,560
They wouldn't behave like that.

619
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:19,560
But because it transforms people and because they see the immense power that they can wield

620
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:26,840
in a distributed and democratic way, then it works in ways which people couldn't predict.

621
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,800
And what that does then is to ensure that representative power, if you've still got

622
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,000
some representative democracy, can't get ahead of the people.

623
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,560
It can't run away from us because we become much more engaged and politically literate

624
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,400
citizens than we were before.

625
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
Wonderful.

626
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,320
Josh, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests.

627
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,640
And it is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

628
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:59,720
What makes me joyful is the incredible bravery of certain people and certain movements.

629
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:05,400
What we've seen all over the world, even in the most impossible situations, totalitarian

630
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,600
situations, situations where you can so easily be imprisoned for life or killed.

631
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,200
I mean, even today, you know, there are environmental activists all over the world being murdered

632
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
for their activism.

633
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,520
And yet they still do it.

634
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,160
They still stand up and do it.

635
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,200
And it's that human courage that makes me joyful because I realize that wherever there

636
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,760
is courage, there is hope.

637
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,880
