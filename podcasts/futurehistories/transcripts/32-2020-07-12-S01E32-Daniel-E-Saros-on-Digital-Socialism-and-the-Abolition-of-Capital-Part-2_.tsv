0	6440	Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross, and what you are about to hear is the second part of an in-depth
6680	13460	interview that I did with Daniel E. Saros on digital socialism and the abolition of capital.
13680	20480	We are about to dive in even deeper into Dan's proposal for a socialist mode of production with its own
20800	25800	socialist laws of motion, all of which he describes in great detail in his book
25800	32800	Information Technology and Socialist Construction, The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism.
32800	37800	If you did not listen to the first part of the interview, then I highly recommend that you do so.
37800	44800	Not only because it's super interesting, but also because today's episode kind of builds on the last one.
44800	54800	I wanted to point the German-speaking audience to another episode of Future Histories that is concerned with the question of a socialist planned economy.
54800	58800	And that is episode 19 with Jan-Philippe Dabrich.
58800	65800	And I wanted to guide all of your attention towards a book that I believe to be a fruitful, if not necessary,
65800	75800	complementary read-to-dance book, and that is Refiguring Revolution, A Critical Theory of Social Transformation by Eva von Redeker,
75800	81800	translated from German by Lucy Duggan. I hope I'm pronouncing this right, Lucy.
81800	87800	Sorry if not. You'll find the link to the introduction of Eva's book in the show notes.
87800	93800	And I mentioned this book because Information Technology and Socialist Construction, so dance book,
93800	97800	is concerned with answering a specific question.
97800	104800	And that is actually still the question that had been asked in the historical socialist calculation debate.
104800	115800	Can there be an intrinsically socialist mode of production that organizes its economy around autonomous socialist laws of motion without the need for markets?
115800	123800	However, we do indeed need a revolution in order to get into the position of implementing such a proposal in the first place.
123800	130800	And luckily, Eva von Redeker wrote a book about what this actually means, a revolution.
130800	143800	If we turn away from this idea of a revolution as this one defining moment where the powers that be are overthrown and everything changes all of a sudden,
143800	149800	but instead look towards an idea of revolution as a praxis and as a process.
149800	155800	And this is why I do believe this to be a great complementary read-to-dance book.
155800	163800	And I am very much looking forward to talking to her soon for future histories. I'll keep you updated.
163800	172800	Before we finally get to the interview, thanks a lot to Kai for your support on Patreon and thanks to Bernhard for your donation.
172800	183800	But now, please enjoy the second part of the interview with Daniel E. Seros on digital socialism and the abolition of capital.
186800	196800	OK, so maybe let me summarize a bit because I think this is, of course, a lot to take in for the listeners as well.
196800	202800	All at once, the different layers and different approaches within the proposal.
202800	208800	There is this general catalog, which could be seen as some kind of socialist Amazon.
208800	216800	Let's say it's a huge catalog of use values, goods or services where I can consume by placing my use value,
216800	221800	the one that I want to purchase within my needs profile, my personal needs profile.
221800	224800	I would have to go to work in order to get credits.
224800	229800	So that's just one of the things that is being expected of me.
229800	230800	I would have to go to work.
230800	240800	But within this work, I'm organized in a democratic way in a workers council that everybody who's working at this socialist enterprise is engaged in.
240800	246800	So this will be organized very, very differently from from how it is being done today.
246800	253800	It would be some kind of democratic economy actually on on every layer possible.
253800	264800	So then there are incentives in place within the system for me to make a plan of what use values, again, goods or services,
264800	269800	I probably will consume next month, for example.
269800	275800	And if I plan good and indeed purchase most of the things that I placed within my needs profile,
275800	282800	I am eligible for a bonus because I through communicating my needs early on,
282800	289800	I helped with with the planning of the whole economy and made it easier for everybody.
289800	294800	I will still be able to purchase items I did not plan for.
294800	301800	I think that's very important to say, but it's just better for me and for everybody else, as I said,
301800	310800	for the for the functioning of the economy if I try to plan as good as possible and think ahead a bit.
310800	318800	And so then the products are being produced based on me registering my needs within the general catalog.
318800	324800	But there's a crucial question that comes up for me that I think I did not yet fully understand,
324800	333800	because how is the information of me ordering, let's say, 20 packages of milk being translated into points?
333800	337800	It cannot be just the quantity of 20 of 20 packages of milk.
337800	344800	So it's 20 points because if I ordered 20 cars, then this this would, of course, be a whole different kind of thing.
345800	360800	So there must be some kind of mechanism in place to translate my needs into points that has some kind of base in how many resources actually went into the production of this good.
360800	367800	So how is this being managed? That was a huge question for me.
367800	371800	Well, each use value would have a base unit, I guess.
371800	383800	So if we're talking about one package, you said one package of milk that, for example, you could select that place it in your needs profile, depending on where you place it.
383800	387800	That'll determine how many points are assigned to it.
387800	390800	So if you place it higher, more points would be assigned to it.
390800	393800	And if you place it lower, fewer points would be assigned to it.
393800	403800	You could put in a whole block of use values, 20 packages, like you said, and you could arrange those consecutively in the profile or you could spread them out.
403800	410800	If some of them you don't feel like you need quite as much, you would rank them lower, others higher.
410800	425800	So the Workers' Council that posted that use value in the universal catalog, general catalog, would be notified of the points that it can then use to acquire inputs to produce that use value.
425800	427800	Yeah, go ahead.
427800	439800	As far as I understood it, at the end, the points will be communicated throughout the system from the registering of my need in the general catalog.
439800	450800	The Workers' Council will get a certain amount of points that it will then use to buy inputs in order to produce the product.
450800	459800	And this will go on and on and communicate throughout the system up until the resource of oil or wood and stuff like that.
459800	480800	But if the weight that is communicated through me registering my need in the needs profile is quantified only by how many items I purchased and where I positioned it in the needs profile,
480800	489800	then it does not communicate how much resources went into the production of that given use value.
489800	494800	Are you saying the consumers need that information?
494800	501800	Well, the whole system needs this information in order to be termed rational.
501800	518800	Because otherwise there would be the chance of excess production where the Workers' Councils, if they just react to the needs of the people and the needs are translated into points,
518800	528800	but not in a way that is anyway related to how much resources are put in, then there's a discrepancy there.
528800	531800	Well, you've asked an excellent question here.
531800	547800	First, I think this situation is somewhat unlikely to arise because much of what we observe in terms of relative valuations in the marketplace and capitalist societies is likely to reproduce itself in a needs-based socialist society.
547800	555800	So that is a package of milk will be ranked much lower and have fewer points assigned to it in most needs profiles.
555800	563800	But let's suppose for the sake of argument that the use values do have a similar ranking for some reason.
563800	574800	In that case, the Workers' Council that posted milk, for example, would receive more resources than it needs in the point allocation process,
574800	583800	and it can virtually return the inputs during the point allocation period if it's receiving more than it needs to meet the current needs.
583800	591800	Once the current needs are addressed, however, this process can be repeated for the allocation of inputs for investment purposes.
591800	595800	Investment could mean expansion in new facilities.
595800	605800	And if milk is valued as highly than such expansion for the purpose of increasing the amount of milk produced might be a logical use of this large amount of resources.
605800	613800	Resources could also be used for product development and innovation, which might also be a good use for them.
613800	620800	Even so, if the Workers' Council believes it's receiving too many resources beyond even what it can productively use for investment,
620800	629800	it does have the option to virtually return the inputs during the point allocation process before it actually receives those inputs.
629800	635800	Finally, let's suppose that all these adjustment factors that I've described fail,
635800	644800	and the Workers' Council that produces milk decides to use its large amount of points to acquire many more resources than it will use productively.
644800	653800	And then at the same time, let's suppose that a Workers' Council that produces automobiles ends up with far fewer resources to meet the current needs.
653800	659800	And so this could happen, to come back to your initial question,
659800	665800	this could happen when automobiles and milk are ranked at the same level in the needs profiles.
665800	672800	It might lead to far too many resources being devoted to milk production, not enough to automobiles.
672800	679800	In this case, the Workers' Council that sells the automobiles,
679800	685800	it will be producing too few automobiles because it doesn't have sufficient resources.
685800	693800	And so it's going to raise their prices and credits because the general rule for pricing in the socialist society
693800	700800	is to aim for the steady and complete sale of automobiles during the point allocation period.
700800	705800	So because they don't have that many automobiles and there are a lot of consumers wanting to buy these,
705800	710800	that's going to cause the Workers' Council raise those prices.
710800	714800	So the rise in prices, of course, is going to frustrate the consumers.
714800	717800	Some will not be able to make the purchase at all.
717800	723800	And so those consumers will then raise automobiles in their needs profiles relative to milk.
723800	727800	And the Workers' Council produces automobiles will gain points.
727800	734800	So this process should continue until enough resources are devoted to automobile production
734800	737800	that prices for automobiles begin to fall.
737800	742800	And so in this way, I think the system will automatically work to correct this imbalance.
742800	746800	But it may take time. But just like in a capitalist society,
746800	754800	it takes time to shift resources from one industry to another in response to changes in consumer preferences.
754800	757800	That's a very interesting answer.
757800	763800	And I think it relates to a kind of even bigger question.
763800	774800	Since you do not have, as it is in a capitalist society, one unit of account, such as money,
774800	783800	you come into a position where you kind of need to establish some kind of balance between credits
783800	787800	on the one hand and points on the other.
787800	791800	So the underlying assumption, as you just explained,
791800	798800	it is kind of that that through these different mechanisms of pricing,
798800	808800	ranking within the needs profiles and the question of how many resources can be used in general
808800	815800	in order to give away points established through the Council of Scientists.
815800	824800	These are the different elements that are thought of bringing about some kind of balance within the system.
824800	827800	Do I get that right?
827800	830800	Yes, I think you've actually hit on a very important point.
830800	835800	And it's something I haven't mentioned previously in the interview.
835800	839800	That is that it is a moneyless economy that we're talking about.
839800	843800	There is no money, not in the way that we know it.
843800	848800	The points don't have, I mean, this is a minor point, really.
848800	852800	The points do not have any physical substance to them.
852800	854800	They're simply electronic.
854800	860800	But more than that, points aren't spent and received by someone else.
860800	865800	It's simply a signal that's communicated from one worker's council to another,
865800	868800	and that is then used to acquire inputs.
868800	875800	So there's no money involved in the allocation of means of production to different worker's councils.
875800	878800	Now, there are credits, at least in the socialist phase,
878800	883800	although in the higher phase of communism, the communist phase, as I'm calling it,
883800	887800	there aren't even credits because at that stage,
887800	894800	people use their points from their needs profiles, consumers do, in order to acquire use values,
894800	900800	because the distribution principle at that point is to each according to his or her need.
900800	903800	So even the socialist credits go away.
903800	907800	But in the lower phase of communism, in the socialist phase,
907800	913800	the credits do seem to resemble money because use values have a price.
913800	918800	Credits are received by workers for their work,
918800	925800	and they receive credits for bonuses when they've registered their needs and then made those purchases.
925800	928800	So those credits are used to acquire use values.
928800	934800	Now, that appears to be money, but the major difference there is that the credits,
934800	938800	when they're received by the worker's councils that sell those use values,
938800	943800	they don't use those credits for any purpose.
943800	946800	Those credits actually, they vanish.
946800	948800	They don't persist in any form.
948800	950800	They're not spent again.
950800	952800	That's how the system is set up.
952800	957800	This is an important point because when credits are being distributed to workers
957800	960800	and to consumers in the form of bonuses,
960800	964800	that increase in the amount of credits in the system could be inflationary,
964800	967800	could lead to hyperinflation, in fact.
967800	971800	Once they're spent, however, because they cease to exist,
971800	975800	that leads to an automatic reduction in the total amount of credits
975800	981800	that are out there in circulation or not in circulation, but in people's hands.
981800	989800	And so there's an automatic sort of way to control this total supply of credits.
989800	994800	And it prevents hyperinflation and or inflation from really developing.
994800	999800	So the way I've described the use of points in the system, the use of credits,
999800	1001800	it's very different from money.
1001800	1007800	And yet there's still a logic to the system that allows for the rational allocation of inputs
1007800	1014800	and I think the rational distribution of use values to consumers.
1015800	1021800	OK, just to make it super safe that I got that right,
1021800	1027800	the elements that serve primarily to guarantee this economic rationality
1027800	1031800	would be on the one hand the price and on the other hand,
1031800	1037800	how the consumers rank their needs within their needs profiles.
1037800	1042800	Because I think my confusion from earlier about the points
1042800	1046800	was addressing a question that I had on how the worker councils,
1046800	1052800	how the workers councils would be incentivized to use their resources,
1052800	1057800	their scarce resources of nature in an efficient way,
1057800	1060800	how that would be established.
1060800	1066800	And as far as I understand it now, I think you say that the answer to this
1066800	1072800	would be that they would be incentivized to use their resources efficiently
1072800	1077800	since there's some kind of price pressure coming from the consumers as well.
1077800	1080800	And if they just act recklessly with the resources,
1080800	1083800	with the points that they are being allocated,
1083800	1086800	then this will feed back into the system.
1086800	1092800	And by that you have some feedback circles that are both
1092800	1096800	communicating the necessary information on what is being scarce
1096800	1102800	and a way to avoid non-efficient use of scarce resources.
1102800	1104800	Do I get that right?
1105800	1107800	Yes, I think that's right.
1107800	1110800	I think the one thing I might add is that
1110800	1115800	what I would regard as efficiency in this kind of a system
1115800	1121800	isn't really the same as what we consider efficiency in a capitalist system.
1121800	1127800	So even though there's a rationality to it in the way that resources are allocated,
1127800	1132800	I don't think that the system is set up to pressure workers
1132800	1135800	to work as long and as hard as possible.
1135800	1142800	I think there's space for other considerations
1142800	1147800	that would allow workers to take into account the speed of work,
1147800	1152800	the nature of their work, and not let efficiency in the capitalist sense
1152800	1156800	be the only sort of value driving what they do.
1156800	1161800	But it still involves rationality in terms of clear rules
1161800	1165800	for the distribution of the inputs, the means of production,
1165800	1167800	and then also the final use values.
1167800	1173800	I'm so glad that you say that because I'm actually split between a dual role here
1173800	1177800	as an advocatus diavoli on the one side,
1177800	1182800	where I try to imagine the arguments that critics will bring up
1182800	1184800	and they will ask for economic rationality.
1184800	1190800	And on the other side, of course, I totally advocate for different ideas of rationality
1190800	1196800	when it comes to what this means within, in this case, a socialist mode of production.
1196800	1202800	And actually, I thought of two ways how to address these as well,
1202800	1207800	because you could easily, within the needs, within the general catalog,
1207800	1213800	you could easily put in other factors that will be taken into consideration
1213800	1219800	by the consumers when deciding up on which product they will put into their needs profile.
1219800	1223800	You could put in the question of what is now called externalities,
1223800	1226800	like the extraction of ecological resources.
1226800	1229800	And the other one would be, for example,
1229800	1233800	happiness of the workers within the workers council.
1233800	1240800	You could put in a anonymous way of feedback on the happiness within the council.
1240800	1245800	And then, of course, I would prefer to purchase a use value from a workers council
1245800	1247800	where people like to work.
1247800	1255800	And this is a super important thing to communicate in such a system, I guess.
1255800	1257800	And it's totally lacking right now.
1257800	1262800	Sure. I'm so glad you raised this point, because this is one of the features
1262800	1265800	of this kind of needs-based socialist system
1265800	1271800	that is supposed to elevate our consciousness, make us more socially aware.
1271800	1276800	And the general catalog will include a lot of detailed information
1276800	1279800	about each use value that we don't normally have access to.
1279800	1286800	And a lot of it includes things like the conditions under which the use value was produced, as you said.
1286800	1289800	And so consumers will be able to take that into account.
1289800	1296800	So social movements like movements for animal rights and environmental protection,
1296800	1299800	those kinds of movements will still play a very important role
1299800	1305800	because it will encourage people to rank certain use values higher in their needs profiles
1305800	1311800	based on what they're hearing and learning about the conditions under which these use values are produced.
1311800	1313800	So glad you raised that point.
1313800	1327800	One big question that came up is that you very much depend on the category of the proletariat as a force, actually.
1327800	1335800	As a political force and as the barrier of these revolutionary ideas.
1335800	1345800	And of course, this brings up the question of whether this proletariat actually still exists as a category,
1345800	1348800	especially in terms of class consciousness.
1348800	1353800	Is this in the 21st century still a thing?
1353800	1357800	Well, I think that this proletariat, as we call it,
1357800	1363800	it does consist of people that have very different living standards, very different occupations, and so on.
1363800	1367800	But the one aspect that all proletarians have in common, I think,
1367800	1370800	is that they cannot live unless they sell their labor power.
1370800	1374800	And that characteristic hasn't really changed.
1374800	1381800	So they don't have sufficient wealth to guarantee that they can live from ownership of wealth alone.
1381800	1384800	And so for a change in the mode of production,
1384800	1388800	these people would need to recognize this shared characteristic
1389800	1394800	and then take this kind of revolutionary action to change the mode of production.
1394800	1398800	It won't be easy, but I think it's a necessary condition.
1398800	1407800	It would require a huge amount of cooperation and coordination across a very diverse group of people.
1407800	1411800	Very diverse. But it's the necessary condition, I think.
1412800	1418800	And also, on the other hand, I think, of course, it sounds kind of old school, the category of proletariat,
1418800	1421800	but the category as such didn't diminish.
1421800	1427800	And I think because things are getting worse and worse and billionaires are getting trillionaires
1427800	1436800	and the rest is getting worse, I think there's room for raising class consciousness again.
1436800	1442800	And there's an attractiveness to that as well, I guess.
1442800	1446800	I have one more on the category of freedom and individual I see.
1446800	1455800	And this is aiming at the inner structure of the workers councils.
1455800	1464800	At some point within the book, you mentioned that there will be a monitoring of the fulfillment of your work responsibilities
1464800	1469800	and that these will be communicated by system administrators.
1469800	1473800	I think even at the end of the day, you're right.
1473800	1476800	This seems a bit much, I guess.
1476800	1480800	But besides the question whether or not it will be every day,
1480800	1486800	there's first the question of elitism as well on the hand of the system administrators.
1487800	1492800	And then this kind of brings up questions of, you know,
1492800	1501800	ugly situations between the peers in quotation marks that have to surveil each other
1501800	1506800	in terms of how good did you work or how bad did you work and stuff like that.
1506800	1509800	So this could get ugly, I think.
1509800	1512800	Sure. No, I had something a little different in mind.
1512800	1515800	In terms of evaluation within the councils,
1515800	1521800	the efforts ratings subcommittees would consist of workers who are members of the council.
1521800	1523800	That would be a rotating body.
1523800	1531800	And, you know, each council could decide on its own how frequently it wants to rotate membership in that subcommittee.
1531800	1539800	Those effort ratings would involve adjusting the annual income maybe once a year.
1540800	1546800	When I said that the or when I wrote that the workers council would communicate
1546800	1550800	to the system administrators at the end of the day,
1550800	1555800	what I had in mind there was just that work had been completed that day.
1555800	1557800	Nothing more than that.
1557800	1562800	And the reason I actually said per day was because whereas currently
1562800	1568800	workers have to wait to receive a paycheck, maybe two weeks, possibly longer,
1568800	1571800	in this system, there's no reason to delay.
1571800	1574800	Workers can be paid immediately at the end of their work day.
1574800	1579800	It's just a matter of making sure that since these system administrators
1579800	1583800	actually are the ones that grant the credits,
1583800	1588800	they would need to be notified that membership is still current,
1588800	1591800	the worker still works as part of the council.
1591800	1597800	That's all. It's not supposed to be a method of evaluation
1597800	1601800	or something that would be withheld for poor performance.
1601800	1605800	Yes, I didn't have that in mind.
1605800	1611800	OK, maybe there could be a rotating element as well to the system administrators.
1611800	1616800	So there is no power accumulation in their hands, actually.
1616800	1619800	I think that's a good idea as well.
1619800	1623800	There are some areas where I ask myself if your proposal might run into
1623800	1629800	reproducing errors of the current political, economical system.
1629800	1632800	The first one is about the role of competition,
1632800	1635800	which I struggle with, I have to say,
1635800	1645800	because I find competition to be one of the evils within our society
1645800	1650800	many times, I think, not only, but most of the times, I guess.
1650800	1655800	You state that a classless society can be expected to be quite competitive.
1655800	1659800	I think, actually, this is kind of problematic,
1659800	1664800	because I'm not sure if this doesn't reproduce a conception of humans
1664800	1670800	as a species that needs to be disciplined and supervised.
1670800	1673800	I do get the point that the proposal should not be utopian.
1673800	1678800	I said it before, and that other non-competitive proposals
1678800	1684800	do have a omission here and often retreat to overly positive interpretations
1684800	1689800	of how things will naturally fall into place somehow.
1689800	1692800	But still, I'm not convinced of the large role of competition.
1692800	1699800	Could you maybe explain why you decided to approach things that way?
1699800	1707800	Yeah, I want to emphasize that competition would play a really minimal role
1707800	1712800	in the kind of socialist society that I'm describing.
1712800	1716800	There wouldn't be competition between workers' councils,
1716800	1722800	not directly any kind of competition in terms of income determination.
1722800	1724800	I mean, this would all be minimized, I think.
1724800	1730800	Where there is competition, I think, and where I find it hard to eliminate competition,
1730800	1736800	is in terms of workers trying to obtain membership and councils
1736800	1739800	to perform specific kinds of work.
1739800	1744800	If one of the guiding principles is from each according to his or her ability,
1744800	1750800	then I think that it's important that workers and young people
1750800	1756800	who are entering school and trying to gain admission to an educational program,
1756800	1759800	let's say a young person wants to become a doctor,
1759800	1763800	they're going to need to compete with their peers
1763800	1769800	in order to secure those spots in those programs,
1769800	1773800	or to secure a spot in a workers' council to do the kind of work that they want to do,
1773800	1776800	because they have to prove that they're able to do it.
1776800	1779800	That's really all I'm imagining for competition,
1779800	1786800	and I find it hard to let go of that as a principle that would need to be in place
1786800	1790800	to ensure that people do demonstrate ability.
1790800	1798800	Yeah, I understand that, I have to say, because it's kind of a check as well,
1798800	1804800	that if somebody who really, really, really wants to become a doctor,
1804800	1808800	but is just simply really, really not qualified to become one,
1808800	1813800	then one has to be somehow honest about it
1813800	1818800	and find a way to evaluate whether the person is qualified or not.
1818800	1823800	And I guess it's a fact somehow.
1823800	1830800	There's another element of competition, though, that I spot and wanted to ask you about,
1830800	1838800	and that is if a workers' council decides to produce a product,
1838800	1844800	and they post it in the general catalogue,
1844800	1851800	and other workers' councils are also posting a similar product,
1851800	1861800	then people might decide to purchase it from the one that builds it from aluminium
1861800	1866800	and the other one that produces it with plastic that is not being purchased.
1866800	1870800	So the needs will be fulfilled, but not mostly from the company,
1870800	1875800	or the socialist enterprise that uses the plastic, in my example.
1875800	1881800	So there will be some kind of competition with regards to that,
1881800	1889800	and that might be spotted through when people purchase what, where,
1889800	1894800	and then you might have an indicator on what is more popular,
1894800	1898800	or you have a rating system as well, or a feedback system,
1898800	1901800	where people leave how they like the product or not.
1901800	1904800	So there will be some indicators, and it's good to have these indicators
1904800	1909800	because they are helpful in order to organise the production as well.
1909800	1916800	But this also introduces an element of competition, I guess, between the worker councils.
1916800	1922800	How is this conceptualised and used, maybe?
1922800	1925800	Yeah, that's a great question. You're right, you're right.
1925800	1930800	It could be interpreted as a form of competition between the worker's councils.
1930800	1935800	One council may find its point allocations dwindling,
1935800	1938800	and another's point allocations are increasing.
1938800	1942800	This could create tension between those councils. You're absolutely right.
1942800	1948800	I think one important point maybe is that the compensation for useful work
1948800	1950800	isn't going to be effective.
1950800	1958800	So it's less likely to lead to resentment between those councils, at least for that reason.
1958800	1963800	And if one council is finding its point allocation diminishing
1963800	1970800	to the point where the council needs to dissolve and the other council is expanding,
1970800	1974800	there's no reason why the expanding worker's council couldn't say
1974800	1979800	or encourage the former members of the other council to join them,
1979800	1983800	join the council, since their enterprise is expanding.
1983800	1988800	They don't need to come up with financial resources to pay those workers,
1988800	1990800	because that isn't how it works.
1990800	1994800	All they need to do is invite them to join the council to become members,
1994800	1997800	and they'll be entitled to their credit income.
1997800	2003800	As long as there's work for them to do, they can merge and resolve it that way,
2003800	2006800	in a cooperative kind of way.
2006800	2014800	So I think you're right. I think there are elements of competition that don't disappear.
2014800	2021800	But I think the underlying principle is cooperation in what I described, I think.
2021800	2023800	Yeah, I would agree, actually.
2023800	2028800	And I think the main reason for that is that the profit motive is eliminated.
2028800	2035800	Because of that, you are incentivized to help the other much more
2035800	2040800	than if it would be a competition for profit.
2040800	2046800	And of course, and that may be utopian on my part,
2046800	2052800	if you have a society that is organized around the principles that you described,
2052800	2060800	the hope is that one would internalize these different kinds of values as well.
2060800	2064800	And since there is no striving for profit,
2064800	2068800	then you wouldn't be incentivized to stab your peer in the back.
2068800	2072800	But you could easily, and without a loss for yourself,
2072800	2077800	just coach the other cooperative how to produce it differently,
2077800	2081800	that it might fulfill a better standard, and stuff like that.
2081800	2085800	And I really liked that in the way you described the proposal
2085800	2093800	when you were writing about the internalized principles of the capitalist mode of production.
2093800	2101800	Because it's not just about the formal rules that we can have in laws and stuff like that.
2101800	2109800	But capitalism also functions through the way that I internalize
2109800	2117800	how the system is working and how I will have to behave in order to produce a likely outcome.
2117800	2125800	And this is kind of sucked up with baby milk.
2125800	2131800	You're formed around these expectations as a person as well.
2131800	2136800	And it's likely to expect that within the socialist mode of production,
2136800	2141800	there would be different types of values that are as well internalized
2141800	2145800	that are more formed around the value of cooperation, as you said it.
2145800	2152800	And so it becomes the question of how likely is a certain type of behavior being made?
2152800	2154800	And I like that, actually.
2154800	2156800	Yeah, I think that's a great point.
2156800	2160800	And one of the central, I think, insights of Marxian theory
2160800	2170800	is that people's consciousness is actually transformed depending upon the mode of production that governs society.
2170800	2174800	And so we can't even imagine, I don't think fully,
2174800	2180800	how much people's consciousness would be transformed if it moved to this kind of society.
2180800	2183800	The value system, as you say, everything would be different.
2183800	2185800	People would just think differently about everything.
2185800	2191800	And hopefully in ways that are much healthier, much better.
2191800	2198800	There's a second question relating to the question of reproducing errors that I have.
2198800	2203800	At some point in the book, I had the quick flash where I was thinking,
2203800	2212800	oh, hoppala, this might be a reproduction of this there is no such thing as society phrase of Margaret Thatcher.
2212800	2215800	And I'd like to quote you here in order to explain what I mean.
2215800	2221800	The quote is in his 1844 critique of different varieties of communism.
2221800	2231800	However, Marx wants that what is to be avoided above all is the reestablishing of society as an abstraction vis-à-vis the individual.
2231800	2233800	The individual is the social being.
2233800	2236800	And then there you end the quote of Marx.
2237800	2244800	Therefore, it is only necessary to identify the manner in which the individual in a socialist society
2244800	2249800	must interact with others to fully develop his or her species consciousness.
2249800	2255800	Because the market is deemed anti-ethical to this cause, it must be replaced with a new mechanism.
2255800	2258800	And then, of course, you go on to describe the mechanism.
2259800	2272800	But still, I was asking myself if you're talking about a kind of individualistic approach that more or less mirrors this.
2272800	2280800	There is no such thing as society phrase from Margaret Thatcher, but just in a socialist manner somehow.
2280800	2286800	Maybe I'm not phrasing this correct, but I hope you get the point.
2286800	2289800	No, I do think I know what you mean.
2289800	2297800	What I'm imagining is that the public functions which I've described, like the system administration,
2297800	2305800	the work of the Council of Scientists and so on, would become sort of merged with all other processes in society
2305800	2313800	in a way that doesn't seem like the state exists as something separate and standing apart from society.
2313800	2317800	There still would be these public functions, as I've described them,
2317800	2323800	but I think the transformation in the way people relate to one another would allow those public functions
2323800	2330800	to become sort of subsumed or just part of society instead of standing apart
2330800	2335800	or us imagining those state functions as being separate or apart from society.
2335800	2337800	I hope that helps.
2337800	2345800	Yeah, I think I know what you mean. It kind of points to the question of withering away of the state.
2345800	2351800	Yes, that's right. And I don't think these public functions would wither away and disappear.
2351800	2353800	Those are still going to be there.
2353800	2357800	Yeah, but it wouldn't be a state that is apart from us somehow.
2357800	2360800	Yes, that's right. That's exactly right.
2361800	2370800	I was wondering if we might run into problems of promoting quantification
2370800	2375800	if we handle certain aspects of your model the way that you described it.
2375800	2383800	Because if, for example, care work and stuff like that, education and things like that
2383800	2389800	would be a part of the general catalogue and would be handled throughout the mechanisms that you described,
2389800	2394800	then they would be handled in a way as if they were quantifiable,
2394800	2406800	even though these areas are having an internal logic that is not adequately represented in terms of quantification.
2406800	2415800	And that's a problem that we do see right now where neoliberals try to reform the health care system
2415800	2420800	along the lines of quantification, and they, to be frank, fucked it up.
2420800	2433800	And we do not want to replicate this idea of an overarching principle of quantification within these systems.
2433800	2436800	So how would you handle that?
2437800	2443800	Yeah, it's a great question, and maybe this society would encounter problems
2443800	2446800	in trying to extend this principle to these areas.
2446800	2450800	I'm willing to allow for that possibility.
2450800	2460800	However, with care work, for example, the one possibility would be that if a family decided to perform that work themselves,
2460800	2463800	maybe designate one person in the family to do that work,
2463800	2467800	then it would be possible for that person to receive compensation for that work,
2467800	2471800	and they would just do what they would do in the home.
2471800	2475800	There may be workers' councils that specialize in care work,
2475800	2478800	and in that case, to include that in a needs profile,
2478800	2485800	it would just be necessary for the workers' council to post in the general catalogue a unit of that service,
2485800	2487800	like maybe an hour of work.
2487800	2489800	That could then be moved into the needs profile.
2489800	2495800	The workers' council specializing in care work would receive the point allocation according to that
2495800	2503800	and then could obtain the inputs that it needs in order to perform that service for those people who registered and need for it.
2503800	2507800	So I think things like care work can be handled.
2507800	2514800	Again, maybe it would encounter problems I'm not seeing, but at least I think we can imagine a way to do it.
2514800	2517800	With education, that's also a difficult one.
2517800	2522800	And like you said, I haven't filled in all the details in the book.
2522800	2525800	Others are going to have things to say about this, hopefully,
2525800	2528800	and they may have ideas on how to make this work.
2528800	2532800	But I at least have some ideas regarding education.
2532800	2538800	I think that it's easiest, I guess, probably to start with an example where you have a,
2538800	2545800	let's say, an educational program that trains workers to do a specific type of work.
2545800	2550800	Well, if that's the case, they're going to be producing some kind of a use value in the future.
2550800	2557800	And so whatever the current registered needs are for that use value could be used to determine the point allocation
2557800	2561800	for that educational program or that educational institution.
2561800	2569800	Those points then could be used to acquire inputs, whatever is needed in order to educate students in that program.
2569800	2572800	So maybe I am overreaching.
2572800	2575800	Maybe I'm saying, hey, this can apply to everywhere.
2575800	2580800	But I think we can at least think about how it might work.
2580800	2586800	Now, if for some reason we ended up rejecting as a society, if we ended up rejecting it
2586800	2594800	because it somehow doesn't work well, we should be open to that, I think.
2594800	2602800	But I think we also should make the effort, if we really do want these to be the guiding principles of our society,
2602800	2608800	from each according to one's ability to each according to one's work initially and then to need later,
2608800	2611800	then it makes sense to try to do it.
2611800	2620800	And also, I think there will be some kind of mechanism for infrastructural work for like roads or trains and stuff like that.
2620800	2629800	And you could easily say that, OK, education as well is a basic infrastructure that we all need.
2629800	2633800	And of course, it is also important to have some moonshot projects.
2633800	2638800	It won't work that you will always know what kind of education you need,
2638800	2651800	because it's good to have some education that does not have a specific use just because you might just not know what use it will have in the future.
2651800	2664800	So it's an investment that still makes sense because you might foster insight into areas where you do not yet know that they will be of use in the future.
2664800	2669800	So that's like an infrastructure, a knowledge infrastructure somehow as well, no?
2669800	2680800	Yeah, you picked up on the fact that I chose the easier example when I chose an educational program that's aimed at producing a use value.
2680800	2682800	Yes. And so that's more complicated.
2682800	2690800	And so like the more basic education is, you know, we'd have to think through how could we maybe make that work.
2690800	2703800	And it may be that in those situations, we pull the points from from many different areas in order to allocate points to those educational institutions.
2703800	2710800	I mean, we may be able to do it that way since, you know, those institutions may be teaching just basic science.
2710800	2717800	Maybe we can pull points from lots of workers councils where that's where knowledge of science is relevant.
2717800	2719800	There might be ways to do it.
2719800	2726800	That's just something that our elected representatives are going to have to work out and determine how to make that work.
2726800	2732800	But I'm not sure there's any other way that we can just say right now exactly how to do it.
2732800	2734800	Yeah, there are ways, at least.
2734800	2749800	Yes, I think in order to to get a sense of how this proposal could be beneficial for all of us, let's engage in a thought experiment.
2749800	2760800	If there had been a socialist mode of production and socialist laws of motion in place in the way that you described and in your proposal in the U.S.
2760800	2766800	During the corona pandemic, how would that have been beneficial in your opinion?
2766800	2774800	Well, I certainly don't want to suggest that all human problems will disappear with the transition to this new mode of production.
2774800	2776800	But I can think of a couple of benefits.
2776800	2784800	First, I think that people will rank basic needs very highly using their needs profiles, including the need for medical care.
2784800	2788800	So many of society's resources will be devoted to health care.
2788800	2793800	And so the strain on this sector should be reduced in a situation like this.
2793800	2801800	Also, I think people are going to be accustomed to thinking about others and less about just kind of doing business as usual.
2801800	2805800	So, you know, people have made a great effort to engage in self distancing.
2805800	2810800	But I think that you would see even more self-sacrifice in this kind of a society.
2811800	2819800	In addition, we wouldn't have powerful interests spreading false information to ensure that the economy continues to grow rapidly.
2819800	2825800	People's health really would be sort of the top priority, I think, in a situation like this.
2825800	2826800	And that would be helpful.
2826800	2835800	And finally, the profit motives would not promote this shameful mistreatment and widespread abuse of animals, I think, that exists in capitalist societies.
2835800	2841800	So these kinds of pandemics, I think, would be less likely to probably occur.
2841800	2853800	The likelihood of diseases originating from oppression of animals, I think, would decline significantly if we transitioned to this other kind of way of living.
2854800	2870800	And I think also because of the historical examples of planned economies, people will immediately say, oh, we know that planned economy, that's a super slow apparatus and they won't be able to react that fast in the case of a pandemic.
2870800	2877800	And then you need ventilators, but the state apparatus is so super slow, so they won't be able to do anything.
2878800	2891800	I mean, you're proposing a very, very different kind of system that is actually much more decentralized and has very different base assumptions.
2891800	2898800	But how would that relate to this fear of not being able to react fast?
2898800	2903800	This isn't something I gave that much attention to when I was writing the book.
2903800	2911800	One point that does come to mind that I did address, which is somewhat similar, I think, has to do with natural disasters.
2911800	2925800	So if there was a natural disaster that caused a large part of the population, let's say, to lose Internet access, it might be possible to set up the system so that immediately those needs profiles of those people
2925800	2934800	transitioned to kind of a more general one that would focus on addressing their most immediate needs first.
2934800	2941800	And then society's resources, point allocations would be redirected towards meeting those needs immediately.
2941800	2947800	So there might be ways to build in kind of emergency responses into the system.
2947800	2949800	Again, I think the system is very flexible.
2949800	2957800	There are ways to sort of to work on those problems in ways that I don't even think I've fully thought about.
2957800	2966800	And also, I think, again, the question of the profit motive is very crucial here, because in the in the case of a pandemic or any disaster,
2966800	2978800	actually, if you do not have the profit motive that hinders the collective forces of all humans to work towards a solution, then you will be better off, I think.
2978800	2987800	I mean, we saw that people were hoarding masks and stuff like that and holding them back because they thought they would get some profit out of it later on.
2987800	2990800	And people needed these masks, of course.
2990800	2993800	And so so this is just destructive behavior, I think.
2993800	3001800	And there would be there wouldn't be an incentive to to behave in ways like that, I think.
3001800	3013800	OK, I think it's also important to at least tease the idea of how we could get to implementing the proposals that you are describing in your book.
3013800	3023800	So there there has to be some kind of idea towards a transition phase and subsequent implementation of what you're trying to do here.
3023800	3030800	Maybe let's just take a small country like Austria, where I live right now, as an example.
3030800	3033800	What would you propose in terms of a transition?
3033800	3035800	What would this look like?
3035800	3038800	How to proceed?
3038800	3046800	Well, the sort of revolutionary transformation that I'm talking about really won't work unless it's broad enough to include major industries.
3046800	3055800	So if it's small, then workers councils will be they'll be forced to rely on markets to obtain inputs and they're going to need to obtain currency.
3055800	3058800	And that means selling products as commodities.
3058800	3064800	So this transformation is going to have to be very broad, very expansive for it to take hold.
3064800	3073800	I do think that one nation could transform the mode of production, but it will have to rely on international trade to some extent.
3073800	3078800	So I provide some suggestions in Chapter eight of the book regarding how this might work.
3078800	3086800	So like in some cases, consumers might register a need for a foreign commodity that is not available domestically.
3086800	3093800	The workers council that posts that foreign commodity would receive points to produce something.
3093800	3100800	It would use the points that it receives to produce something that it can trade as a commodity for the foreign produced commodity.
3100800	3111800	So there might be ways to still obtain goods from capitalist nations while transforming your mode of production domestically.
3111800	3119800	But still, I think too much reliance on commodity exchange is going to undermine the momentum of this shift to a new mode of production.
3119800	3128800	So that those are at least some some thoughts about how one might do one might pursue such a transformation in a small country.
3128800	3136800	But obviously, the smaller the the experiment is, the more obstacles it's going to face.
3136800	3150800	And apart from small countries, what are the couple of steps that you would propose if one wants to get on the pathway to a transition in general?
3150800	3160800	Yes. So it would be necessary first for individuals to start communicating their needs using needs profiles.
3160800	3166800	And workers would need to start actually posting use values in a general catalog.
3166800	3173800	So all of this can start before any kind of revolutionary transformation takes place.
3173800	3178800	The infrastructure is there. It would just be necessary to actually start setting it up.
3178800	3183800	This would also be a good time to be educating people about how this system is going to work.
3183800	3189800	People are going to have to understand if they're going to actually move forward in trying to implement this.
3189800	3202800	Only after all of that is really kind of in place, would it then be possible to use it to start guiding resource allocation, to have workers actually take control of the means of production and so on.
3202800	3208800	And I mean, you know, it would it would require also a political movement.
3208800	3219800	Workers and consumers would would need to support political party and candidates for office who would actually want to try to pursue these kinds of changes.
3219800	3227800	So I think those are the things I see happening before there's even any abolition of private property or private ownership of the means of production.
3227800	3238800	These things would we need to take place first, the educational effort and the effort to actually start setting up a general catalog and needs profiles and so on.
3238800	3256800	That's super interesting. So if I understand that correctly, this would mean that you would necessarily have a hybrid version before and that we could actually start now to build this hybrid.
3256800	3275800	Like the like a shadow economy, actually, with a needs with a general catalog where only use values are posted that are being produced.
3275800	3282800	With certain standards like only use values from cooperatives, for example.
3282800	3299800	So and if it grows and grows and grows and grows, then you would be more and more able to rely for most of your daily purchases on the use values of the general catalog and that it would like
3299800	3311800	that you would be able to fade out your purchasing via money and substitute it through purchases that you do on the general catalog. Am I right?
3311800	3324800	Yes, that's right. The one thing I might add is that what is posted in the general catalog during this phase might also include commodities produced by capitalist firms.
3324800	3339800	So not just like workers cooperatives, there would need to be protections in place for workers to actually do this because capitalist enterprises may not want their commodities listed there because they know where this is moving.
3339800	3347800	And there's going to be resistance. So that's why protection from the state for these efforts would also need to be in place.
3347800	3357800	And that's why the political movement is important, too. Can't just do this and not expect capitalist interests to kind of look the other way.
3357800	3364800	They're not going to like this. They're going to resist. And so, yeah, so that's the thing I would add.
3365800	3384800	So, I mean, we actually pressed you on quite some topics already, but still, I'd like just to generally ask you, because we talked about the shortcomings of market socialism and we will talk about Paragon, another proposal soon.
3384800	3391800	I'd just like to ask you as well. What do you think are the shortcomings of your proposal?
3391800	3400800	Yeah, I'm glad you asked me this question. It forced me to critique my own proposal in more than I have, I think, previously.
3400800	3409800	But some use values, I think, are easily incorporated in needs profiles and others are not so easily incorporated.
3409800	3415800	For example, shoes, you know, are easily included, whereas something like housing is more difficult.
3415800	3424800	I mainly hope to promote discussion of this proposal because I think there are many intelligent thinkers who are going to be able to think through some of these difficult questions.
3424800	3432800	I view what I did is mostly initiating this conversation, not as providing any kind of final answers on all of these questions.
3432800	3441800	And you pointed out, and I think rightly so, that there are certain use values and certain kinds of services like care work, education.
3441800	3451800	These are going to be difficult to include. So that is a shortcoming, I think, but maybe one that we can overcome by trying to work out the details.
3451800	3460800	The other shortcoming, I think, is that it might lead to complications that I just have not anticipated and that perhaps no one can anticipate.
3460800	3472800	I mean, what we're talking about is such a radical and drastic change in the way we live that there's no way to know completely how it would play out.
3472800	3481800	So, you know, these complications that come up, they could make the system unworkable for some reason. I'm willing to acknowledge that possibility.
3481800	3495800	However, I also think that we're approaching the time where we must have an open discussion about alternative economic systems if we're going to address these global environmental challenges that are really threatening all of us at this point.
3495800	3505800	Now, of course, you are not the first one to propose an alternative political economy since the socialist calculation debate took place.
3505800	3515800	There have been others before and you discuss an approach called participatory economy or short paracon at length in your book.
3515800	3524800	How does paracon differ from your proposal? And since it is already being practiced, where and how is it being implemented today?
3524800	3534800	Paracon was developed by Michael Albert and Robin Hanell in the early 1990s and has been developed quite a bit since that time.
3534800	3543800	Paracon is a non-market participatory economic planning model that aims to promote remuneration based on effort and sacrifice and production.
3543800	3547800	So that's one of the similarities, I think, to my perspective.
3547800	3556800	It also involves council democracy, and so it includes workers councils and consumers councils that contribute to the formation of the annual economic plans.
3556800	3562800	Their planning process involves something called an iteration facilitation board.
3562800	3567800	It announces so-called indicative prices with the councils submitting plans.
3567800	3574800	And then the prices are set to account for social costs, not just private costs, the way market prices do.
3574800	3580800	The prices are also iteratively adjusted to clear markets, surpluses and shortages.
3580800	3588800	Workers in a paracon society also work a variety of jobs as part of a so-called balanced job complex.
3589800	3595800	So that is that workers are assigned a mix of jobs, with some of the jobs being more empowering than others.
3595800	3598800	This is a significant difference from my proposal.
3598800	3606800	I don't have an element of this really where job complexes are formed and involve a balancing of empowering and disempowering tasks.
3606800	3614800	But the idea is that this approach is supposed to ensure that a class of workers never arises that only performs disempowering work
3614800	3623800	and avoids the rise of a class of workers that specializes only in coordination and what Albert and Hanel call a coordinator class,
3623800	3629800	which they think could easily arise and has arisen in socialist societies of the past.
3629800	3634800	They also think a set of values should underlie the paracon economy.
3634800	3639800	So these values include things like solidarity, equity, self-management, diversity.
3639800	3649800	There have been paraconish experiments that have been initiated in different countries, including Finland, Sweden, the UK, and the United States as well.
3649800	3654800	Robin Hanel has a forthcoming book actually on democratic economic planning.
3654800	3660800	So in terms of what I think the shortcomings are, these ideas had a major impact on me.
3660800	3667800	So I really want to emphasize that much of the socialist proposal that I developed in the book built on their vision of a participatory economy.
3667800	3671800	And so I have great respect for them as visionaries.
3671800	3677800	I have several objections to the paracon vision, however, that I think distinguish my proposal from their proposal.
3677800	3689800	So first, I think that the participatory planning process involves a trial and error method of adjusting prices that resembles the early suggestions in the socialist calculation debate.
3689800	3692800	And I really wanted to kind of move away from that.
3693800	3698800	I think we need a more dynamic and organic method of organizing the economy.
3698800	3706800	I also think that the balanced job complexes do not do enough to protect freedom, to pursue the occupations that one enjoys the most.
3706800	3710800	So I also deviate from that there.
3710800	3719800	I think from the phrase from each according to one's ability is more likely to be achieved if we allow workers to compete for jobs on the basis of ability.
3719800	3726800	As I was mentioning earlier, I also think the emphasis on a moral basis of the system is problematic.
3726800	3733800	And that, too, is something that makes my perspective, I think, different from a lot of thinkers on the left.
3733800	3737800	This sort of skepticism about objective morality.
3737800	3743800	I don't think we should try to pursue values or ideals that are detached from sort of objective conditions.
3743800	3745800	That's sort of how I think about it.
3745800	3753800	Instead, we should be focused on ending capitalist exploitation, which I think is something we can discover through an analysis of existing conditions.
3753800	3759800	And so we should be focused on that rather than sort of striving for these these value ideals.
3759800	3765800	But even so, even with all that said, I think Parakhan offers features that I find to be attractive.
3765800	3769800	And again, they really influenced me in the development of my proposal.
3769800	3779800	Great. And what I was actually a bit surprised to see is that you didn't really cover the proposal by Cockshart and Cottrell at length.
3779800	3787800	Maybe I was surprised because I did an interview actually with a PhD student of Cockshart before in Germany.
3788800	3792800	So I was a bit familiar with the ideas there.
3792800	3803800	And because it's one of the more prominent proposals out there for some kind of, let's say, digital socialism, I was expecting to read more about it.
3803800	3807800	But you didn't cover it that much.
3807800	3814800	I do see differences, of course, mainly in the decentralized access.
3814800	3821800	So how do you relate to the proposal of Cockshart and Cottrell and how is yours unique in relation to this?
3821800	3834800	Well, yeah, I would say that the really embarrassing truth here is that limitations on my time were the reason that I did not investigate it in detail.
3834800	3841800	I had to make some choices and Parakhan was the one that I decided to really devote attention to.
3841800	3846800	I think that what makes mine unique is that it grew out of my work on Marxian theory.
3846800	3850800	And this point is really quite subtle.
3850800	3859800	You can see it if you compare my work on Marx's theory of the turnover process of capital with my breakdown of the socialist circulation process into five phases.
3859800	3862800	I use a timeline to do that in the book.
3862800	3865800	And it really did.
3865800	3873800	It emerged from my close analysis of reading capital volumes one and two in particular.
3873800	3880800	And, you know, so for this reason, I think that I like to think and maybe I'm wrong,
3880800	3888800	but I think that I've developed the only vision of the socialist mode of production that is really consistent with Marx's theory of the capitalist mode of production,
3889800	3892800	which is quite a strong claim to make.
3892800	3900800	But since it emerged from my study of Marx's capital, I think I can make that claim.
3900800	3904800	I don't think the other alternatives achieve that.
3904800	3914800	Finding a substitute for that movement of capital that I described earlier and that's found in volume one of Marx's capital.
3914800	3925800	So, yeah, I'm afraid I don't have much more to say in terms of my relationship to Cockshott and Cottrell's proposal.
3925800	3931800	But I think comparisons would definitely be worth investigating in more detail.
3931800	3945800	Yeah, to me, it seems as if you were more striving for a kind of organic socialist law of motion and that Cockshott and Cottrell seem to be looking for,
3945800	3951800	and I'm being polemic here, seem to be looking for a perfect plan that can be computed.
3951800	3960800	You know, and that's very different from from the way you approach things in a very basic level, on a very, very basic level, I think.
3960800	3966800	So the book came out in 2015 and now it's five years later.
3966800	3977800	So I think there might be some development on different ends, not the least technological.
3977800	3985800	So Amazon got a hold of more and more and more and more of our lives and economies.
3985800	3995800	And by doing that also kind of engages in a proof of concept when it comes to the question of general catalogs.
3995800	4005800	So they are, for example, doing things like giving you a better price if you subscribe to certain products.
4005800	4017800	So that kind of reminded me of the idea that you should plan ahead and put in your needs in the general catalog and stuff like that.
4017800	4028800	So some of these things are already being done, but in a, of course, capitalist fashion and within a capitalist mode of production.
4028800	4036800	What has changed in these last five years? What did disprove or prove your proposals to be right?
4036800	4045800	Yeah, you've asked an interesting question here in his review of my book, actually, which appeared in the review of Radical Political Economics.
4045800	4051800	John Willoughby has dubbed my proposal Amazon Socialism. I don't know if you encountered that.
4051800	4055800	Yes, I read it. I read it. Yeah.
4055800	4059800	I found that to be amusing that he called it that. And I think you're right.
4059800	4064800	I think there are elements there that are similar to what I described.
4064800	4075800	So it has a massive offering of commodities that I think suggest or shows that we have the technical infrastructure to to make it a reality.
4075800	4086800	We can have a general catalog that has a massive amount of use values and the specifications are clearly listed in great detail.
4086800	4091800	But it's still commodity production, ultimately, and that and it represents capital in motion.
4091800	4095800	And in that sense, what Amazon does is nothing like what I've proposed.
4095800	4103800	So there's definitely an element there that's similar, but also it diverges significantly.
4103800	4115800	And and there are some things, too, that are that would be, I think, emphasized in the general catalog that aren't emphasized, you know, in Amazon's listings, for example.
4115800	4122800	You know, for example, like the date range for the purchase in order to qualify for a bonus, things like that.
4122800	4133800	Those are, I guess, elements that that don't really apply in the realm of commodity production that do apply in the socialist proposal.
4133800	4139800	So all the question of environmental destruction is not listed on Amazon as well.
4139800	4143800	It's just called externality.
4143800	4151800	But did you read the piece by Evgeny Morozov in the New Left Review called Digital Socialism?
4151800	4156800	Yes. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Because he he talks about your proposal at length as well.
4156800	4163800	Yes. I was really grateful for that review for that, at least that analysis of what I what I wrote.
4163800	4166800	And I think it helped gain attention for the proposal. Yeah.
4166800	4178800	And he's pointing out the need to socialize the means of feedback production, I think, is the phrase, because when you talked about Amazon and how it is different and how it still might be helpful,
4178800	4186800	I think that's a that's a point to emphasize. It's there is a technological infrastructure of means of feedback production.
4186800	4195800	That is actually the basis for why you say that this proposal is possible now and it hasn't been before.
4195800	4205800	No, I think that's the circle. How we get to the to the beginning of the interview that you state that Marx wouldn't have been able to see this solution.
4205800	4213800	And by that, it was kind of clever not to engage in what would have been a utopian speculation at the time.
4213800	4222800	If you would have wanted to sketch the these ideas of how socialist mode of production could look like.
4222800	4227800	And so he refrained from it. That's kind of one of one part of the argument.
4227800	4235800	Yeah. Yeah. And I think if we if we don't accept what I've said here, then what is it that Marx did?
4235800	4245800	And was it just I don't know, like some people believe it was just a big lie.
4245800	4259800	But why? Why? Why is it the lie then? Because I mean, if you if you provide a super good analysis of the capitalist mode of production, it's still some it's good work, you know?
4259800	4274800	Yes. It's something. Yes. And so so that made you know, it could leave us though with a very depressing sort of conclusion that what Marx did was this extraordinary analysis of capitalism.
4274800	4283800	And we're all condemned forever now to live in a society based on class exploitation. There's nothing we can do about it.
4283800	4289800	You know, that is so that is so depressing. So I think a lot of people don't want to think that way about it.
4289800	4297800	So instead, they say, well, he was wrong. He just got it wrong. You know, it's kind of the system's contradictory or whatever.
4297800	4302800	You know, the transformation problem proves he was wrong or whatever.
4302800	4314800	I mean, the deterministic idea of how the like how the phases will one lead to another and then there will be this revolution and that was wrong.
4314800	4319800	But that doesn't mean that the analysis of the capitalist mode of production was wrong.
4319800	4341800	I mean, it's not that easy. But I think this is one of the main benefits that I got from reading your book is that I do not believe that we have to suffer this exploitation for the rest of our lives and into eternity.
4341800	4347800	But there are different modes of production that can be achieved.
4347800	4355800	And this is actually that this this leaves me optimistic and not depressed, I have to say.
4355800	4361800	Well, that's great. I'm so glad that I wanted to I wanted to complete the story somehow.
4361800	4372800	This is this is what could emerge from capitalism and and it's a future that that can give us hope.
4372800	4379800	Yes, but it's not it's not it's not a completion, though. It's a it's an opening, I'd say.
4379800	4388800	Yes. OK, then at the end of each of my interviews, I always ask the question.
4388800	4392800	If you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
4392800	4406800	Well, I think this idea that that one day everybody might cooperate within this global system of production and distribution is such an exciting possibility.
4406800	4418800	In the society that I've tried to describe today, you know, everyone's needs are given equal weight in the economic process and no one takes advantage of others for material gain.
4418800	4429800	It's hard to imagine, you know, with all the problems facing our our world today that we could live in a society like that.
4429800	4434800	But I think actually it's become easier to imagine than ever before.
4434800	4437800	We just we need to have this conversation.
4437800	4451800	And, you know, I'm so grateful that you initiated this and that you're willing to share these ideas with the people of Austria and with people everywhere.
4451800	4455800	So I'm deeply grateful to you for doing that. Thank you.
4455800	4461800	Well, Dan, thank you so much for taking the time to be a part of future histories.
