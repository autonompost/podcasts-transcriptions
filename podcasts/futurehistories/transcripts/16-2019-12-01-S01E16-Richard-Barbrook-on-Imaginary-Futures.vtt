00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
Welcome to Future Histories.

00:01.960 --> 00:06.780
My name is Jan Gross, and my guest today is Richard Barbrook, who is, amongst

00:06.820 --> 00:12.320
other things, known for coining the term Californian ideology as an early critique

00:12.320 --> 00:14.720
of Silicon Valley techno-determinism.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.300
He and Andy Cameron wrote their influential essay on the subject in 1995,

00:20.340 --> 00:22.780
and the topic is as prevalent as ever.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.620
I met Richard at the 10-year anniversary of the techno-politics

00:26.620 --> 00:28.300
research group here in Vienna.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.660
So shout outs to them as well.

00:31.140 --> 00:35.820
Another person whom I was happy to meet again there is Jaya Clara Brecke,

00:35.820 --> 00:41.100
my guest in episode six, which was, up until now, the one episode in this

00:41.100 --> 00:42.760
podcast that I did in English.

00:43.240 --> 00:48.400
So if you're not fluent in German, but indeed love future histories, then please

00:48.400 --> 00:51.100
go and check out episode six with Jaya.

00:52.020 --> 00:56.300
And whatever language you actually speak, if you like the show, then please

00:56.340 --> 01:02.060
tell a friend, or if you can, then support it on Patreon via patreon.com

01:02.060 --> 01:03.620
slash future histories.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.220
Marianne and Paula recently did just that.

01:07.260 --> 01:13.020
And I want to send my warmest thanks to them for doing so, but now please

01:13.020 --> 01:16.340
enjoy today's episode with Richard Barbrook.

01:21.980 --> 01:24.940
Richard, you have done so many different things.

01:24.940 --> 01:27.540
I think it's easier if you introduce yourself.

01:28.180 --> 01:33.060
Well, I teach politics at the University of Westminster in London, and I'm a

01:33.060 --> 01:39.380
founder member of Class War Games, and we also run a cooperative called

01:39.380 --> 01:41.460
Digital Liberties that makes games.

01:42.060 --> 01:49.180
And I was sitting outside a cafe in Vienna and someone came up to talk to me,

01:49.260 --> 01:50.740
who I thought might be begging for money.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.740
But then I realized he actually did, because I'd never met the guy before.

01:53.940 --> 01:57.180
And he said, you are the person who wrote the Californian ideology.

01:57.620 --> 01:58.820
And I said, yep, that is true.

01:59.340 --> 02:01.620
So that's the other thing I'm well known for.

02:01.900 --> 02:08.100
That was in 1995, where we critiqued.com neoliberalism before its time.

02:09.380 --> 02:16.700
And hopefully starting a process that will eventually lead into

02:16.700 --> 02:18.380
different kinds of futures.

02:18.740 --> 02:19.460
Ah, yes.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.420
Well, it's one of the reasons I got interested in futures, like writing

02:23.420 --> 02:24.380
histories of the future.

02:24.380 --> 02:28.660
I wrote a book called Imaginary Futures, which is the start of the first chapter

02:28.660 --> 02:30.780
that says the future is what it used to be.

02:31.500 --> 02:36.900
So things like, you know, predictions of artificial intelligence or, you

02:36.900 --> 02:40.420
know, fusion power or space tourism.

02:40.460 --> 02:45.020
They've been around since at least the 1960s, and they come back with a

02:45.020 --> 02:47.220
regularity, which is quite extraordinary.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.060
And of course, the information society, we're always about to transition from

02:51.540 --> 02:55.700
industrial capitalism to some sort of digital utopia.

02:56.180 --> 03:00.020
And again, that goes back to at least the 1960s, or in its Russian

03:00.020 --> 03:02.100
original version, the 1950s.

03:02.900 --> 03:07.500
One point you're making is actually that there is this repetition of futures

03:07.500 --> 03:13.020
actually, and you pledge us to invent new imaginaries of futures.

03:13.020 --> 03:16.780
So why do we need these new imaginaries of future?

03:16.980 --> 03:20.620
Well, I think the reason is because, I mean, I've just been to visit the

03:20.620 --> 03:25.300
Red Vienna Exhibition, which everybody should go and see next to the Rathaus.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.340
And that's an interest.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.340
That's interesting because they had a very clear vision of the future.

03:31.780 --> 03:36.620
So people in Vienna before the First World War had terrible housing and bad

03:36.620 --> 03:38.980
health care and really poor education.

03:39.380 --> 03:43.700
And so to raise the mass of the population up, they had a vision of a sort of social

03:43.700 --> 03:46.940
democratic transition to communism.

03:47.580 --> 03:51.620
And what you need to do is have a healthy, educated and well-housed proletariat.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.820
And then they went and did it.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.460
And it's quite extraordinary achievement.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.460
And present day Vienna still benefits from that attempt.

03:59.860 --> 04:05.940
And that's that's an example of if the left needs a way of thinking about a future,

04:06.300 --> 04:10.780
because if you know, when you start doing things now, they're like a beta version of

04:10.780 --> 04:13.660
what's going to come up, come eventually.

04:13.700 --> 04:18.340
And so if you don't have that idea of an imaginary future, you're in a bit of a

04:18.340 --> 04:20.980
problem because the right does have an imaginary future.

04:20.980 --> 04:25.580
It has a sort of neoliberal dystopian, but in Britain, it's called Brexit.

04:27.620 --> 04:32.940
You know, so you turn yourself into a sort of fantasy version of America, basically.

04:33.020 --> 04:35.980
Or even worse, a native nationalism.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.620
Well, that is partly America, yes, of course.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.100
I can live there.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.220
No, no, I went to school in America where they used to make them all pledge allegiance

04:45.220 --> 04:48.940
to the flag every morning, which is a little English person I thought was very weird.

04:50.260 --> 04:55.100
So, you know, they have to inculcate a nation, a multinational country and

04:55.220 --> 04:57.940
homogenize them into one thing called Americans.

04:58.940 --> 05:05.100
So how could these like really radically different imaginaries, imaginary futures

05:05.260 --> 05:10.860
look like? Because, I mean, there's social democracy, but we kind of had that.

05:10.860 --> 05:16.020
And it's at the end, I mean, at least in the way it has been done, like the

05:16.020 --> 05:24.620
last 40, 50 years, it has always been a, like a compromise between a social

05:24.620 --> 05:27.060
welfare state and a capital market.

05:28.820 --> 05:33.620
I met an English guy who was living here on the, in the exhibition, who was

05:33.620 --> 05:37.580
lecturing me about the awfulness of British politics because you don't want

05:37.580 --> 05:42.140
to compromise, and I was saying, well, you can't compromise, that's the problem.

05:42.820 --> 05:48.140
Yeah, you've had that advantage that the, I was told by an Austrian of the post

05:48.140 --> 05:51.900
war generation who said the socialists and the Christian Democrats learned to

05:51.900 --> 05:54.540
compromise in the concentration camp.

05:56.380 --> 06:00.860
So, yeah, you've had that built into the system because of the trauma of the

06:00.860 --> 06:05.620
civil war and the Nazi occupation and all the rest of it, and the second war,

06:05.700 --> 06:09.540
and that you, which you lost, it went badly.

06:09.980 --> 06:15.620
But the, but the, the imaginaries that you are calling for, they are aiming for

06:15.620 --> 06:18.020
something different, for something more, actually.

06:18.020 --> 06:18.540
Exactly.

06:18.580 --> 06:19.340
What does it look like?

06:19.340 --> 06:24.900
I mean, if you went to Britain today and showed them red Vienna, that would look

06:24.900 --> 06:30.020
like an imaginary future, you know, 60% social housing, really good welfare

06:30.020 --> 06:34.820
services, you know, okay, it's a very paternalistic vision of social

06:34.820 --> 06:39.980
democracy, but nonetheless, compared to lots of places in England today, and

06:39.980 --> 06:42.660
especially in America, it would seem even more utopian.

06:43.900 --> 06:48.980
So that, that sort of vision I agree with, he does seem data, though, of course, if

06:48.980 --> 06:53.260
you're Chinese, it seems like the future, of course, they are building social

06:53.260 --> 06:58.500
housing on a massive scale and all this sort of stuff and adding digital

06:58.580 --> 06:59.540
technology to it.

07:00.340 --> 07:04.980
And they do think that they're going to build communism in 30 or 40 years.

07:05.420 --> 07:10.260
As I, oh, yes, I met somebody from a party school in Beijing, who confidently

07:10.260 --> 07:12.740
predicted that they would be there in 50 years.

07:13.460 --> 07:17.260
And I said, if I come back in 20 years time, it'll still be 50 years away,

07:17.260 --> 07:17.700
won't it?

07:18.940 --> 07:20.660
To me, it doesn't look that way.

07:20.660 --> 07:27.100
I mean, they are actually more going to a, like engineered capitalism, no?

07:27.100 --> 07:30.420
Confucian socialism, as Daniel Bell's son calls it.

07:30.460 --> 07:31.140
Oh, right.

07:31.140 --> 07:31.820
That's the term.

07:31.820 --> 07:32.260
I see.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.020
Well, it's got a sort of, you know, particularly they've had a long tradition

07:35.020 --> 07:38.900
for a thousand, well, I think Confucius is two and a half thousand years ago.

07:39.300 --> 07:44.580
This vision that you have an enlightened elite who look after the people.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.380
So, but it's really comes from the Han dynasty, doesn't it?

07:48.380 --> 07:52.260
It's like 1000, 500 years ago, whatever.

07:52.940 --> 07:53.180
Sorry.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.700
What's the, the future that you are imagining?

07:57.420 --> 08:00.620
I think it's, I think we should, I said, I think we should think the

08:00.620 --> 08:05.140
Pali is a reassertion though of the old socialist future.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.140
I think that is an important part of it.

08:07.140 --> 08:11.820
It's interesting that one of the things that I found with continentals and they

08:11.820 --> 08:15.700
think what's happened in the Labour Party recently is they find quite the strange

08:15.700 --> 08:18.220
is this reassertion of socialist iconography.

08:18.860 --> 08:23.180
So if you think of something like Podemos in Spain, they got rid of the red flag

08:23.340 --> 08:26.020
and the international and all this sort of stuff.

08:26.500 --> 08:31.340
Whereas in England, that scene is quite important to reassert that continuity

08:31.340 --> 08:34.900
with working class history, you know, back to, I mean, obviously England's

08:34.900 --> 08:38.140
had a long tradition, long history of working class struggle back to

08:38.140 --> 08:39.220
the early 19th century.

08:39.540 --> 08:43.260
So, you know, an interesting thing is, so one of the things are, which would be

08:43.260 --> 08:48.180
seen as an imaginary future or a vision of the future is the Labour Party had a

08:48.180 --> 08:54.220
conference about 18 months ago called alternative models of ownership where

08:55.060 --> 09:01.500
you know, obviously the neo, the neoliberal model has failed, privatisation,

09:01.500 --> 09:02.740
deregulation.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.220
And so how do you replace that?

09:06.340 --> 09:11.700
One thing is that go back to the old state capitalist nationalised industries.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.380
That seems not a good idea.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.860
So the alternative models of ownership is to look at things like municipal

09:18.860 --> 09:23.300
ownership, obviously what a lot of red Vienna would be quite inspiring, but also

09:23.300 --> 09:27.620
particularly cooperatives, you know, cooperatives were developed in mid 19th

09:27.620 --> 09:33.860
century England, consumer co-ops, housing cooperatives and producer cooperatives.

09:33.860 --> 09:38.740
And so if you look at places like Preston, which is the city in the north of

09:38.740 --> 09:46.500
England, the local council has actually started to develop local cooperative

09:46.500 --> 09:51.140
economy, partly to keep money, money, you know, when they private, previous

09:51.140 --> 09:55.300
councils privatised services, money was being taken out of the local economy by

09:55.300 --> 09:58.220
the privatised providers of services.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.900
If you hand them over to cooperatives, the money tends to stay within the local

10:02.900 --> 10:06.980
institutions. And this is now seen as a model for creating a new type of

10:06.980 --> 10:12.940
socialism that's based on not just replacing private managers with state

10:12.940 --> 10:16.260
managers, but actually to democratise the economy.

10:16.740 --> 10:21.900
And this comes back to a lot of thought that was done, a critiques actually of

10:21.900 --> 10:28.620
the old type state system that, you know, that they trusted managers and people who

10:28.620 --> 10:33.300
were, you know, basically white collar, this was a paternalistic, this would be

10:33.300 --> 10:36.820
the downside of the red Vienna model, this very paternalistic view.

10:37.060 --> 10:42.060
But if you've got an educated workforce, they ought to be able to run the system

10:42.100 --> 10:46.740
themselves. You know, who knows how best to run a railway, John McDonnell, who's

10:46.740 --> 10:50.380
the finance spokesman of the Labour Party.

10:50.700 --> 10:54.620
And he would say, well, who knows how best to run a railway, not the managers, it's

10:54.620 --> 10:59.140
the people who drive the trains, maintain the tracks, look after the stations.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.380
They know how to run the railway.

11:00.380 --> 11:04.420
So what you have to do is get what they often call their tacit knowledge about the

11:04.420 --> 11:07.860
system and get an input that into running things.

11:08.140 --> 11:12.060
And I think that's an interesting vision, because actually that is a new modern

11:12.060 --> 11:16.180
vision, particularly if you couple it with digital technologies, you know, using a

11:16.180 --> 11:21.620
lot of the stuff that we do in everyday life with social media and polling and all

11:21.620 --> 11:25.580
the other stuff that you can do and allow people to pass, you know, not just to turn

11:25.580 --> 11:30.060
up to meetings, but to contribute knowledge in other ways and to be consulted.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.180
But actually, also, it's going back to the middle of the 19th century.

11:33.180 --> 11:37.380
This is what English socialism was about, actually, before the First World War.

11:38.060 --> 11:44.140
So if you read Karl Marx, who's the German theorist of English socialism in

11:44.140 --> 11:47.180
volume three of Capital, he said, what's the what's the future?

11:47.180 --> 11:49.100
It's actually not the state ownership of everything.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.820
It's the cooperative ownership of everything.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.620
He's quite explicit about that.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.460
And that comes from that experience.

11:54.460 --> 11:58.700
So that's a good example where, in a sense, you have to look back at old

11:58.700 --> 12:03.100
versions of the future and then think about how they can be redesigned and

12:03.100 --> 12:06.900
inspire us to think about how do we create a new version?

12:06.900 --> 12:11.900
Because obviously, the problems we're facing are some ways the same, you know,

12:11.900 --> 12:16.420
capitalist alienation and exploitation, in some senses, have intensified.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.540
But on the other hand, they're very different because we have a very

12:18.540 --> 12:25.180
different workforce, for instance, much more ethnically diverse gender.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.540
All these other issues have to go into it.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.220
And I think crucially, it's much, much better educated.

12:31.460 --> 12:35.780
So if you have a better educated workforce, more skilled, it's going to

12:35.780 --> 12:41.220
think about how it wants to run its own life in a very different way than

12:41.220 --> 12:45.700
people who are desperate, who are very happy if people provide them with

12:45.700 --> 12:50.620
housing and education and healthcare and all the rest of it, particularly if

12:50.620 --> 12:52.740
it's done by a very enlightened leadership.

12:52.940 --> 12:57.220
Now, I think people feel that they want to say in all this, in a real say as well,

12:57.220 --> 13:00.700
not just ticking boxes.

13:01.700 --> 13:09.140
So that means the transition would actually start in the here and now by

13:09.180 --> 13:14.740
establishing work-owned cooperatives that serve as practical examples for

13:14.740 --> 13:17.900
this kind of economic structure.

13:18.300 --> 13:24.180
But there would still be a market mechanism that is in place in between

13:24.180 --> 13:25.340
the different cooperatives.

13:25.340 --> 13:29.940
Is that just a transitional phase or is it also, what about markets?

13:30.260 --> 13:36.100
Are they a part of the structure that you are aiming for?

13:36.100 --> 13:43.500
Is it like market socialism or will there be a transition that, for example,

13:43.500 --> 13:47.660
involves abolishing money and the commodity?

13:49.140 --> 13:55.060
Abolishing the commodity labor power, the ultimate appeal.

13:55.060 --> 14:00.820
We used to read this book by a guy called Jan Appel called Communist

14:00.820 --> 14:04.740
Production and Distribution, which I finally managed to get a copy of at the

14:04.740 --> 14:06.540
Anarchist Book Fair a few years ago.

14:07.100 --> 14:11.620
And that's quite interesting re-looking at that because he was a Dutch council

14:11.620 --> 14:18.180
communist, so he was writing, must have been in the late 20s, early 1930s.

14:18.540 --> 14:19.700
And it's how do you do that?

14:19.860 --> 14:20.500
It's really interesting.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.420
How would you do that?

14:21.940 --> 14:27.420
If you actually wanted to get rid of money, and it's always been this conundrum.

14:27.420 --> 14:31.980
I mean, Robert Owen, who's the founder of English socialism, thought you could just

14:31.980 --> 14:34.900
replace gold pieces with labor notes.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.580
You know, you do one hour of this and one hour of that and you just swap the note.

14:39.100 --> 14:43.740
But as Marks points out in the introduction to Gundersen, what happens is

14:43.740 --> 14:48.700
that the labor note slowly turns into money and becomes the regulator and

14:48.700 --> 14:50.060
commodifies the labor.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.100
Yeah, and so that he has this really interesting problem.

14:53.100 --> 14:58.580
And you think now, of course, with digital technologies, a lot of this sort of state

14:58.580 --> 15:02.020
planning, which went massively out of fashion after the collapse of the Soviet

15:02.020 --> 15:04.900
Union, suddenly it seems a lot more rational.

15:05.260 --> 15:10.380
You know, I wrote about the invention of the internet in America, where they

15:10.380 --> 15:15.820
pumped huge amounts of money in the 1960s to invent this very esoteric computer

15:15.820 --> 15:19.060
network because they were terrified that the Soviet Union was doing it.

15:19.060 --> 15:22.300
And one of the reasons the Soviet Union wants it is because they had the idea

15:22.300 --> 15:26.620
that they could replace the state plan with a giant mainframe that would

15:26.620 --> 15:31.380
instantly, you know, you go into a shop and buy red socks and it would send back

15:31.380 --> 15:34.940
a message to the sock factory saying, produce more socks in this size than the

15:34.940 --> 15:35.660
color red.

15:36.100 --> 15:40.260
And of course, this seemed incredibly utopian then, but now any pre-supermarket

15:40.260 --> 15:41.340
does it with barcodes.

15:41.980 --> 15:46.100
And it's a debate that is being revived, actually.

15:46.140 --> 15:51.140
I mean, there's this book, The People's Republic of Walmart by Leith Phillips and

15:51.140 --> 15:54.340
Mark Michael Roswowski.

15:54.380 --> 15:57.940
Well, it also goes back to the people that there's been a really renewed interest

15:57.980 --> 16:03.140
in what happened in Chile with Stafford Beer and Cybersyn, I've met Raul Espejo.

16:03.740 --> 16:07.500
There's this very brilliant, brilliant book by Eden Medina, which is called

16:07.500 --> 16:11.380
Cybernetic Revolution, it was originally going to be called Cybernetic Socialism,

16:11.380 --> 16:15.940
but surprise surprise, MIT Press quickly changed the title, which is interesting

16:15.940 --> 16:18.380
because in a way they weren't revolutionaries, they were much more

16:18.380 --> 16:19.060
socialist.

16:19.060 --> 16:22.740
But again, in America, I guess words mean certain things, don't they?

16:23.940 --> 16:27.780
And that's also interesting where, you know, they're using like one mainframe

16:27.780 --> 16:32.500
Intellics machines, though the control room looks very good where you have all

16:32.500 --> 16:36.180
these guys at the top, they're basically the guys who are coordinating the

16:36.180 --> 16:39.180
distribution information, it's not really a top-down thing, it's a sort of

16:39.180 --> 16:39.940
coordination.

16:40.300 --> 16:45.620
And they all have these wonderful 70s chairs and they have a space for their

16:45.620 --> 16:50.420
glass of whiskey and cigars, like a sort of gentleman's club.

16:51.540 --> 16:54.340
Stafford Beer obviously thought there was nothing too good for the workers.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.460
So that's, I think, interesting.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.580
So there's that, yeah, there's that.

16:57.580 --> 17:02.340
And obviously, the other thing that people don't talk about, but I think is

17:02.340 --> 17:07.060
the real big thing, is China, because they still have state planning on a

17:07.060 --> 17:07.980
massive scale.

17:07.980 --> 17:11.580
And one of the, you know, it's the fastest growing economy in world history.

17:11.900 --> 17:18.100
It is the great transformation of our generation is China in the last 70 years

17:18.100 --> 17:20.300
and particularly in the last 30, 40 years.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.900
I mean, and state planning is absolutely at the core of this process.

17:25.260 --> 17:25.660
Yeah.

17:25.660 --> 17:30.580
Well, but I think that the general argument from the other side would then

17:30.580 --> 17:36.820
be to say, well, it might be that they still are dominant in terms of planning,

17:36.900 --> 17:44.420
but just after they opened their market to a capitalist market logic of competition

17:44.420 --> 17:53.140
and for-profit production, they made this like huge jump and that this would

17:53.180 --> 17:59.540
actually underline the effectiveness of markets and for-profit motive.

18:00.340 --> 18:04.420
On the flight here, I think it's called China Daily or something, I got a copy

18:04.420 --> 18:08.500
of and it's interesting because they're talking about the 70th anniversary and

18:08.500 --> 18:11.820
they quite correctly point out, you see, you couldn't have had that leap without

18:11.820 --> 18:17.620
the previous Mao period where they increased the lifespan of the population

18:17.620 --> 18:22.780
from the average age was 35 and it increased to 64 under Mao's reign.

18:22.900 --> 18:27.620
I mean, extraordinary education, health, that, you know, to actually have those

18:27.980 --> 18:30.660
people who were ready to make that transition.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.060
And that's how you can't really disentangle one from the other.

18:35.140 --> 18:39.820
I think that, I think a lot of historians now have started to get away from that

18:39.820 --> 18:40.980
ideological debate.

18:40.980 --> 18:45.060
I think for us, obviously, we find talking about red Vienna, isn't it?

18:45.060 --> 18:50.060
It's one, it's an interesting historical example, but we're, we're faced with

18:50.060 --> 18:51.620
very different problems, I think.

18:52.020 --> 18:56.060
And I think what the question you ask is correct, which is, you know, we, you

18:56.060 --> 19:01.620
know, you can take some mixture of the plan and the market and you can massively

19:01.620 --> 19:05.540
raise living standards and you could, you know, in England, you know, we could build

19:05.580 --> 19:07.660
2 million social housing.

19:07.660 --> 19:12.260
We could lower people's housing costs massively if we essentially reversed what

19:12.260 --> 19:17.100
Thatcher and her successors did, which is sell off housing and now a huge bubble to

19:17.100 --> 19:19.020
take place and all the rest of it.

19:19.020 --> 19:19.660
That's possible.

19:19.660 --> 19:24.020
We know how you can do that and you can do it with even within the capitalist

19:24.020 --> 19:24.500
system.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.500
The question then is, but how do we move beyond that?

19:27.740 --> 19:31.980
Because a lot of the problems people have, I mean, a great example is mental

19:31.980 --> 19:36.540
health, for instance, is to do with the stress of living under this capitalist

19:36.540 --> 19:41.620
society, causing record level of depression and, you know, various other

19:41.820 --> 19:42.500
ailments.

19:42.900 --> 19:47.500
And that is to do because people don't live, they live in socially alienated

19:47.500 --> 19:51.460
lives, meaningless lives, they think.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.900
And so you need to create that again.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.620
That's a, that's a sort of different level of problems, isn't it?

19:56.860 --> 19:58.180
Yeah, definitely.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.420
And I think that the problem then lies at the end.

20:01.420 --> 20:06.180
If you go down the rabbit hole, it lies within the question of political economy

20:06.180 --> 20:10.860
and that's where you figure it in the DNA, you know, in the DNA of the political

20:10.860 --> 20:11.460
economy.

20:11.700 --> 20:16.420
Well, of course, I mean, cause you know, a lot of political economy was, had those

20:16.460 --> 20:22.140
questions and then they very deliberately in the academic system split them in

20:22.140 --> 20:23.140
half politics.

20:23.140 --> 20:27.100
I mean, I teach politics and then there's another profession called economics.

20:27.580 --> 20:31.260
And it's interesting that you could, you know, you could spend three years at a

20:31.260 --> 20:35.900
university doing a politics degree and know nothing about economics, but how you

20:35.900 --> 20:41.420
could talk about the modern state without it being a class state or, you know,

20:41.420 --> 20:45.780
bureaucratic state or, you know, all these other things that it's like that

20:45.780 --> 20:51.260
because of this transformation that took place when we were where we moved from

20:51.260 --> 20:55.460
feudalism to capitalism, however you put it, you know, whatever that means.

20:55.460 --> 21:02.460
But, you know, the difference between a medieval way people produce wealth, as

21:02.460 --> 21:06.660
Adam Smith would say, the wealth of nations, you know, the difference between

21:06.660 --> 21:09.460
that and how we live now is just profound.

21:09.660 --> 21:15.700
And that creates changes in the politics and culture in relation to personal

21:15.700 --> 21:17.380
relationships and all the rest of it.

21:17.380 --> 21:18.940
And so it's extraordinary.

21:18.940 --> 21:22.140
You can do, and then you have economics, which is just like astrology.

21:22.780 --> 21:26.620
It's just a sort of, you know, very complicated mathematics, garbage in,

21:26.620 --> 21:30.900
garbage out basically, you know, and that's not that, you know, the fact that

21:30.900 --> 21:35.180
these, these people are even considered to be academically credible is what I

21:35.180 --> 21:36.380
find extraordinary.

21:37.940 --> 21:44.980
So one of the, one of the tasks at hand, I guess, would be to, to implement profound

21:44.980 --> 21:48.140
change within the economics departments at the universities.

21:48.140 --> 21:54.340
And we can by abolish them, but the statistic, I mean, to be fair, I mean,

21:54.340 --> 21:59.940
obviously in bourgeois economics, as we used to call it, there is very good

21:59.940 --> 22:03.460
statistical work going on, but it's just like the basic ground theory.

22:03.500 --> 22:08.180
The fact that when I was taught a level economics, that's 16, I was 16, I did

22:08.180 --> 22:13.220
economics school and I remember the Trevor Jones was our teacher and the

22:13.220 --> 22:18.980
first lesson of the, of my first year of economics, two years ago, he did the

22:18.980 --> 22:23.180
demand and supply curve on the board and said, it's all wrong, but you have to

22:23.180 --> 22:24.620
learn it to pass the exam.

22:25.020 --> 22:28.220
And it was only many years later when I read Adam Smith and David

22:28.220 --> 22:29.620
Ricard and of course, Karl Marx.

22:29.860 --> 22:35.140
I realized what he meant is like the wrong answer to the wrong question.

22:38.940 --> 22:42.020
And so, so to do something like that, where you have a profession that's,

22:42.100 --> 22:45.100
who's both basic theory is such an error.

22:45.100 --> 22:50.260
They don't know what a price is and they don't understand how prices are defined

22:50.260 --> 22:55.300
either, so that's a bit problematic when you're studying capitalistic economics.

22:56.620 --> 23:01.060
But that's a, that's a very interesting point because I think that's exactly one

23:01.060 --> 23:06.380
of the points that we need to address because it works as a narrative.

23:06.580 --> 23:07.540
That's an ideology.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.340
Yeah, that's an idea, but it does work.

23:09.380 --> 23:13.060
It also works if you want to collect large amounts of statistical data, because

23:13.060 --> 23:16.180
on the, it talks about the surface forms of capitalism.

23:16.460 --> 23:21.380
So one of its functions is to create large, you know, have large data sets.

23:21.380 --> 23:25.780
And then you can say something about, you know, I don't know what the stock

23:25.780 --> 23:30.580
market is going to be like in a year's time or usually wrongly, but, or, you

23:30.580 --> 23:34.060
know, what the growth rate is, all these sorts of things, but what it can't say

23:34.060 --> 23:36.420
is, you know, why is there a capitalist crisis?

23:36.580 --> 23:39.700
You know, they can't, you know, the most fundamental thing of the last 10 years

23:39.940 --> 23:44.540
has been the implosion of the, near implosion of the financial system and the

23:44.540 --> 23:49.500
really bad policies that were adopted to prop up the world system in the last

23:49.620 --> 23:50.260
decade.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.700
They can't talk about that because they actually don't have the theoretical

23:53.700 --> 23:55.660
tools that allow them to understand it.

23:56.180 --> 23:57.220
And that is really interesting.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.500
And then, but it's not just that.

23:58.500 --> 24:02.860
I don't think it's just the shifting of, you know, economics from politics, but

24:02.860 --> 24:05.820
you know, the way that anthropologies are separate, you know, history is over

24:05.820 --> 24:10.780
here, cultural studies is over, you know, there's a whole series of these, of this

24:10.780 --> 24:16.060
division of labor within intellectual life, which isn't talking to each other.

24:17.100 --> 24:21.340
And then once they say in their little bubble, especially as academics are a

24:21.340 --> 24:25.940
bit like, I don't know, they're a bit like monasteries in the 90s, in the

24:25.940 --> 24:29.060
middle evil period where they're all doing their own, you know, chanting

24:29.060 --> 24:33.780
Latin masses or so the rest of the population are concerned, completely

24:33.780 --> 24:39.940
outside practical engagement in what society is doing, which again is okay

24:39.940 --> 24:43.420
because it's good that they're accumulating knowledge about obscure

24:43.420 --> 24:47.580
things, but it's not being reintegrated back into our society and precisely for

24:47.580 --> 24:48.540
the problem you're talking about.

24:48.540 --> 24:55.380
If we want to think about how do we go beyond capitalism, broadly defined, we

24:55.380 --> 24:59.220
actually have to be able to draw on all this human experience and think about how

24:59.260 --> 25:04.020
you do do things like complicated things, like divide and distribute labor,

25:04.020 --> 25:08.500
create social wealth in a way that people don't find alienating, find

25:08.540 --> 25:13.740
fulfilling, have time to look after their children and all the other things.

25:14.060 --> 25:16.940
Having a son, I always think that's the most important thing in life,

25:16.940 --> 25:18.100
because hanging out with him.

25:18.740 --> 25:26.460
But could you, could you like briefly sketch how this could be done?

25:27.460 --> 25:34.540
Because I mean, if we talk macro level-ish kind of things, and we just

25:35.140 --> 25:39.620
briefly touched the socialist calculation debate and how they...

25:40.380 --> 25:44.380
Well, with the Austrians, you also, it's interesting that this...

25:45.140 --> 25:46.540
Austrian economics, I have to...

25:46.620 --> 25:48.780
You mean Austrian economics or Austrians?

25:48.980 --> 25:53.380
No, the Austrian economics, which was for people who hated Red Vienna.

25:53.780 --> 25:58.260
So you think like Hayek, Mise, Schumpeter to a lesser extent, but basically

25:58.260 --> 25:59.620
they're all, they all hate it.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.620
You can think Hayek was a snob, wasn't he?

26:01.980 --> 26:06.140
The idea that the proles would actually have decent housing and hang out in

26:06.140 --> 26:08.980
coffee bars was probably his idea of hell.

26:11.020 --> 26:13.260
And he just spent the rest of his life trying to...

26:13.740 --> 26:16.820
It's interesting because the Road to Serfdom, which was Margaret Thatcher's

26:16.820 --> 26:20.900
favorite book, which he wrote in exile in London.

26:21.540 --> 26:25.900
And what he says there is if you set up a national health service,

26:27.060 --> 26:31.300
Britain's probably greatest beloved institution, it's the straight run to

26:31.300 --> 26:32.660
the Gulag Archipelago.

26:33.180 --> 26:35.660
It's a completely batshit crazy book.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.700
I mean, I'm old enough to remember Thatcher being elected.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.860
So I went and read this book because he said this is her favorite book.

26:41.860 --> 26:45.140
So I was going around telling you, I said, this is like Mein Kampf.

26:45.140 --> 26:48.060
This is, you know, read it because this is what she's going to do.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.420
You know, this is craziness.

26:49.780 --> 26:53.180
But she's doing it because they believe in this and they did.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.260
That's exactly what they did.

26:54.260 --> 27:00.980
So if we want to go back to actually countering that, we need our own type of

27:00.980 --> 27:05.540
narratives, which again, take things like the socialist calculation debate and say,

27:05.820 --> 27:06.860
well, actually, you were wrong.

27:06.860 --> 27:10.540
You can calculate in different ways, particularly now we've got all this

27:10.540 --> 27:13.340
computing bow that allows us to calculate.

27:13.340 --> 27:17.700
But the question is, what are you calculating and what is the purpose of

27:17.700 --> 27:18.740
this calculation?

27:19.060 --> 27:23.580
Yeah, because otherwise you end up like in Chinese central planning, you know.

27:24.340 --> 27:24.820
Exactly.

27:24.820 --> 27:27.500
I guess, I mean, these are two points, I guess.

27:28.620 --> 27:35.140
One is that we need to define what we are aiming for in the sense of what's,

27:35.460 --> 27:41.980
what's the purpose, you know, because we agree that the purpose being just profit

27:41.980 --> 27:44.140
is one of the huge problems right now.

27:44.180 --> 27:50.580
So we, we can put in something like a general wellbeing, you know, for

27:50.580 --> 27:52.980
everybody, each individual.

27:52.980 --> 27:56.420
But then there's the question of how to, I mean, but I think that's.

27:57.020 --> 28:00.700
Stafford Beer has a really great idea, which is, you know, you go to, I don't

28:00.700 --> 28:05.460
know, you go to hotels or restaurants or whatever, and they're more like public

28:05.460 --> 28:08.500
transports or things and they have these little smileys which go, I don't know

28:08.500 --> 28:12.820
whether you have them here, they are like dark green, light green, something

28:12.820 --> 28:16.300
on red, whether you're happy or sad and you press them.

28:16.300 --> 28:19.300
And he wanted to actually have them in everybody's home and everybody every

28:19.300 --> 28:21.220
day would vote where they were happy or sad.

28:21.780 --> 28:23.220
So nothing, nothing else, just where they're happy.

28:23.220 --> 28:26.060
And obviously some people will be sad because they're sick or they quarrel

28:26.060 --> 28:29.180
with their partner or something, but he just said all in general that the

28:29.180 --> 28:32.580
government would know every day, whether it was the people were happier than sad.

28:33.140 --> 28:37.500
So you just said the government, that's, that's my, my, my point of entry, I guess,

28:37.500 --> 28:38.180
because I mean.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.500
Well, he was doing it for the Chilean government.

28:41.100 --> 28:46.460
I think my question is just, uh, there's this, um, I do see one of the narratives

28:46.460 --> 28:51.980
popping up that, uh, against the, you know, Austrian, uh, narrative of, uh,

28:52.420 --> 28:57.380
price as being the supreme price and market mechanisms, uh, being the supreme

28:57.380 --> 28:59.260
mechanism of allocation of resources.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.540
You've got the Austro Marxist approach.

29:03.860 --> 29:07.060
And then there's this, I mean, there's the narrative that is popping up right

29:07.060 --> 29:08.900
now, which is kind of, all right.

29:08.940 --> 29:15.620
Um, uh, we can see in, uh, large scale companies like Walmart or Amazon and

29:15.620 --> 29:19.060
anything that, uh, planned economy is possible in general.

29:19.220 --> 29:25.860
So let's try this with different, um, uh, uh, goals, of course, you know, not

29:25.860 --> 29:31.420
for profit, but that would imply some kind of, uh, centrally planned economy.

29:31.420 --> 29:35.700
But it, it seems as if what you're promoting is not a centrally planned

29:35.700 --> 29:39.740
economy, but a more decentralized, um,

29:39.780 --> 29:43.860
Well, centralization is inevitable though, in a way, because we're, you

29:43.860 --> 29:45.100
think about the world economy.

29:45.100 --> 29:49.940
It's also slowly going into three zones, China, Europe, and North America.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.140
And these are very large.

29:51.140 --> 29:55.500
Europe is a very large group of people who are all, um, okay.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.580
We might be very, I think we're very diverse, but to outsiders, they

29:58.580 --> 29:59.460
all think we're the same.

29:59.940 --> 30:03.420
I had a Chinese student this year who came up with, she said to me very

30:03.420 --> 30:07.900
soon, she said, I don't understand why the Europeans keep quarreling with each

30:07.900 --> 30:08.180
other.

30:08.460 --> 30:11.420
Why don't you form a strong centralized state?

30:11.420 --> 30:12.180
Like we did.

30:12.300 --> 30:17.100
It's been very successful from which country was China, China.

30:17.140 --> 30:17.820
Ah, okay.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.060
Yeah.

30:18.140 --> 30:21.500
So for that Charles, she's concerned, you know, the last 70 years is the

30:21.500 --> 30:23.420
best in Chinese history.

30:23.820 --> 30:28.340
And it's because they created in 1945 a strong centralized state and it had

30:28.340 --> 30:32.220
driven the country forward into the, you know, whatever, you know, prosperity

30:32.220 --> 30:36.900
media, was it a mediumly prosperous ecological civilization, or whatever

30:36.900 --> 30:38.580
the latest phraseology is.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.500
So, but what would, what would be your

30:42.060 --> 30:45.140
I'm not, I'm not really in favor of Confucian socialism.

30:45.140 --> 30:45.420
Yes.

30:46.740 --> 30:47.820
But what are you in favor?

30:47.860 --> 30:49.100
Well, that's what I'm saying.

30:49.100 --> 30:54.740
I think it's interesting that the, what, uh, from the experiences of, uh, labor,

30:54.740 --> 30:58.540
local governments in the 1980s, which is, you know, the present leadership

30:58.580 --> 31:03.140
lay party comes very much out of the Greater London Council, the GLC, and

31:03.140 --> 31:05.620
other left labor councils in the 1980s.

31:06.220 --> 31:10.540
Thatcher closed down because they were two good examples of what you could do

31:10.540 --> 31:16.460
instead, and a lot of that was moving away from top down paternistic, but, and

31:16.460 --> 31:20.500
to create bottom up cooperative type structures, but I don't think it's a

31:20.500 --> 31:25.060
centralization seat decent enough, because often to make the, you need

31:25.060 --> 31:27.140
economies of scale often to make them work.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.220
So it's only the Preston model.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.100
If they just had a few co-ops, they, okay, that works.

31:31.100 --> 31:34.500
But once you start getting lots of co-ops and they all start to

31:34.820 --> 31:37.660
collaborate with each other, sometimes they might be buying and selling.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.420
Other times they just might be working together in other ways.

31:40.780 --> 31:46.700
You start to actually generate more productive wealth, but also I think

31:46.700 --> 31:50.900
the other key thing is it empowers people and it changes people politically

31:50.900 --> 31:53.620
and culturally, and they feel more self-confident.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.620
That's the other key thing.

31:54.860 --> 31:58.300
Lots of the other problem, the high ECU model, of course, is it just treats

31:58.300 --> 32:00.180
people as disposable commodities.

32:00.900 --> 32:05.660
And, you know, we had zero, I don't, you know, zero hours contracts and stress.

32:05.660 --> 32:08.060
And as I said, all the stuff we were talking about before, and if you

32:08.060 --> 32:10.980
create healthier and happier people, that's what they want to do.

32:10.980 --> 32:11.940
People want to contribute.

32:11.940 --> 32:16.060
They would like to contribute to society, but they need to be happy as well.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.420
So that seems to be a key thing.

32:19.860 --> 32:23.820
So I'm a bit wary about the centralization decentralization debate,

32:23.980 --> 32:25.580
particularly because of Brexit.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.700
We suddenly, suddenly everyone's in favor of the federal Republic of Europe.

32:30.340 --> 32:31.700
That's one thing the Brexiteers have done.

32:31.700 --> 32:36.660
They've actually made the English, who had the major Europhobic problem.

32:36.860 --> 32:41.260
They've actually created a mass pro-European movement in England, which is bizarre.

32:41.500 --> 32:44.340
I had never thought I'd see demonstrations with large numbers of

32:44.340 --> 32:46.660
people flying European flags.

32:47.100 --> 32:50.940
And then if you go to the Labour Party, the two flags that people have on their

32:50.940 --> 32:56.020
badges and all the rest of it are one Palestine, for obvious reasons.

32:56.380 --> 33:00.380
And the second, the second is the European Union, which seemed

33:00.380 --> 33:02.340
like a strange combination.

33:03.540 --> 33:08.460
You can see that all around, I guess, because oftentimes it's also in the

33:08.460 --> 33:11.700
public discourse, that's how it is being presented.

33:11.700 --> 33:19.620
It's either the right-wing nationalists or the liberalism as we knew it.

33:19.620 --> 33:29.300
And in the, let's say, mainstream media, in lack of any other term, it's described

33:29.300 --> 33:31.220
as if there's nothing else, you know?

33:31.260 --> 33:33.860
Well, that's what they have, and that is the classic mainstream media, like the

33:33.860 --> 33:35.780
choice between a liberal or a fascist.

33:36.020 --> 33:36.340
Yeah.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.100
Macron had it, the Macron election.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.740
You have a choice between a liberal or a fascist.

33:39.900 --> 33:40.220
Yeah.

33:41.940 --> 33:42.860
What's the choice?

33:42.860 --> 33:43.740
That's not the choice.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.060
So you'll opt for...

33:46.060 --> 33:46.780
Socialism.

33:47.340 --> 33:49.980
...cybernetic communism, I read somewhere.

33:50.100 --> 33:50.980
Yes, exactly.

33:51.140 --> 33:54.300
Do you have a catchy phrase, how you define cybernetic communism?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.620
Well, that came out of the Imaginary Futures book.

33:57.660 --> 34:03.180
I was just, I was interested, this came from this thing that the origin myth of

34:03.180 --> 34:08.700
the internet is that somehow it was a system to survive a nuclear war, and this

34:08.700 --> 34:12.620
goes back to the Paul Barron report in the early 1960s.

34:12.860 --> 34:18.060
He wrote for the Rand Corporation, funded by the US Air Force, and notorious for

34:18.220 --> 34:20.140
promoting the invasion of Vietnam.

34:21.380 --> 34:23.660
But it struck me as that was just like very unlikely.

34:23.660 --> 34:28.940
Why would you replace cheap, reliable switches with expensive, flaky mainframes?

34:28.980 --> 34:31.820
I mean, we're not talking about the sort of chips we have in our mobile phones.

34:31.820 --> 34:35.100
We're talking about computers the size of a room, right?

34:35.100 --> 34:37.060
So this just, this didn't make sense.

34:37.060 --> 34:41.180
And so it was only digging, actually, I didn't even do that much research, but

34:41.220 --> 34:45.660
once you actually go and read some of the conferences from the early 1960s, the

34:45.660 --> 34:51.740
1964 American Cybernetic Society, being an obvious example, they're terrified.

34:51.740 --> 34:54.980
They all say the Russians are going to build the internet within four years.

34:55.780 --> 35:00.620
So that's why they're doing it, because they've had Sputnik, the Americans lost

35:00.620 --> 35:05.220
the race to put the first satellite, and then you have Yuri Gagarin, they lost the

35:05.220 --> 35:10.340
race to put the first human into space, and Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman

35:10.340 --> 35:15.180
into space. So they, you know, all these key milestones on that particular thing.

35:15.260 --> 35:17.500
That's why they always go on about landing on the moon, because they have to

35:17.780 --> 35:22.260
say that they lost all the early parts of the space race.

35:23.020 --> 35:27.740
So that they then invented ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projectation, and its

35:27.740 --> 35:31.060
next project was to stop cybernetic communism.

35:31.700 --> 35:36.700
Nikita Khrushchev, in the 22nd Party Congress, actually said the Soviet Union

35:36.700 --> 35:39.540
will enter cybernetic communism in the 1970s.

35:40.740 --> 35:44.500
That we will solve all the problems of central planning by building a giant

35:44.500 --> 35:45.020
mainframe.

35:45.780 --> 35:51.340
But they didn't. I mean, there was the attempt in Chile, with Stafford Beer, but

35:51.380 --> 35:52.740
and there were attempts in the...

35:53.100 --> 35:57.940
No, they got terrified, they got scared, because in 1968, during the Prague Spring,

35:58.260 --> 36:04.900
Radovan Ritka, and the Academy of Sciences in Czechoslovakia, published this book

36:04.900 --> 36:06.860
called Civilization at the Crossroads.

36:06.860 --> 36:12.620
And it says, Stalinism is the industrial age, and we're about to enter the

36:12.620 --> 36:17.300
Information Society, and this will be cybernetic communism, by the Party.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.860
And so they just got really scared.

36:19.860 --> 36:22.580
They suddenly thought, well, if we set up computer networks everywhere.

36:23.580 --> 36:26.660
So they weren't as clever as the Chinese, you see, they just got terrified.

36:26.660 --> 36:29.700
They just thought people would use it to self-organize, which of course they did.

36:31.100 --> 36:35.500
But, you know, still couldn't stop solidarity in Poland, could they?

36:37.260 --> 36:38.060
So that's interesting.

36:38.060 --> 36:44.940
So everybody shut down the different way of approaching cybernetics, actually.

36:44.940 --> 36:50.140
The United States shut it down in Chile, and the Soviets did it by themselves,

36:50.140 --> 36:50.580
actually.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.420
They didn't need somebody else to do it, no?

36:52.660 --> 36:52.900
No, no.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.820
Well, that's one of the reasons they didn't get the internet.

36:54.900 --> 36:55.700
I think it's really interesting.

36:55.700 --> 37:01.820
I have friends who grew up in Soviet, and every computer network was, you couldn't

37:01.820 --> 37:03.740
actually operate from one network to the other.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.660
They already did this with telephones.

37:05.660 --> 37:08.940
They used to have layered telephone systems, which is why you should see

37:08.940 --> 37:11.340
those pictures of Soviet bureaucrats.

37:11.340 --> 37:14.900
They have like six telephones on their desk because it shows you've got more

37:14.900 --> 37:18.500
telephones the further you went up the hierarchy because you've got access to

37:18.500 --> 37:22.820
a special network, and they did the same thing because they were afraid if you

37:22.820 --> 37:25.740
had one telephone system, anybody could ring anybody else.

37:26.980 --> 37:29.140
And that's another thing.

37:29.180 --> 37:33.860
When we come back to, when we're thinking about, you know, how modernity has

37:33.860 --> 37:38.140
progressed, the command and control, top-down command and control is really

37:38.140 --> 37:42.620
important, because at each stage of technology, there's a debate, a struggle,

37:42.820 --> 37:50.540
actually, a social shaping of technology over who's going to control it.

37:50.540 --> 37:52.740
Is it going to be bottom-up or is it going to be top-down?

37:54.140 --> 37:56.740
And the internet is a very classic example of that.

37:57.700 --> 38:03.220
And it's a super important part you're just mentioning because one of the

38:04.020 --> 38:10.460
titles of a chapter within an essay that Evgeny Morozov just recently published

38:10.460 --> 38:15.220
in the New Left Review, the whole essay is called Digital Socialism, but one of

38:15.220 --> 38:20.940
the chapters, it's titled Socialize the Means of Feedback Production!

38:21.300 --> 38:29.420
So that would be an obvious barrier, you know, because right now the means of

38:29.420 --> 38:37.020
feedback production, that would actually be the ground upon which such a cybernetic

38:37.740 --> 38:45.500
planned economy could be done, you know, they are right now owned privately by

38:45.500 --> 38:53.980
huge corporations and a necessary step would be to socialize these means of

38:53.980 --> 38:54.700
feedback production.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.780
Well, all to supersede them.

38:57.900 --> 39:02.220
That's, well, in a sense, but you think something like Google is effectively owned

39:02.220 --> 39:07.620
by the state, I mean, it's, you know, it's a creation of the National Security Agency.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.340
But it's not owned by the state.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.300
But it's effectively controlled by the Americans.

39:11.500 --> 39:15.020
I mean, it's when they go on and on about the Americans, but not by the state, no?

39:15.380 --> 39:17.060
By the elite, then, okay.

39:17.620 --> 39:21.260
But you think when they go on about Huawei, they go on about Huawei in the back doors,

39:21.260 --> 39:25.500
allegedly, in its technology, and you think they're just talking about themselves.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.500
That's what they're doing.

39:26.900 --> 39:27.700
Now, what's Google?

39:27.700 --> 39:29.700
It's a giant information machine.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.580
We're sucking up data for the national security state in America.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.540
I mean, you have a choice now.

39:34.540 --> 39:38.620
Do you want to be spied, use Apple and be spied on by the American secret police or

39:38.620 --> 39:41.060
Huawei and be spied on by the Chinese secret police?

39:41.580 --> 39:44.140
I mean, that's a great choice for you, isn't it?

39:44.540 --> 39:44.700
Yeah.

39:44.700 --> 39:48.740
So that there would have to be a different kind of entity.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.580
When you talk about socializing, they are socialized already.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.300
It's just how they're socialized.

39:54.820 --> 39:59.220
So what does it, you know, socially, you know, it's what Mark, again, what Mark points out

39:59.220 --> 40:02.380
in volume three of capital, a joint stock company is a form of social ownership.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.580
It's just a social ownership.

40:03.980 --> 40:08.580
It's structured in a particular way to benefit a particular class.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.260
But you see, so it's not individual ownership.

40:11.260 --> 40:12.900
It is a form of social ownership.

40:12.900 --> 40:17.780
So Google is a form of social ownership, which, you know, the founder, the two founders

40:17.820 --> 40:19.820
basically own it outright.

40:19.820 --> 40:23.500
I mean, the shares are traded, but they don't really, they can't appoint the board of

40:23.500 --> 40:28.980
directors. So so who they who they're accountable to.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.780
I mean, that's another question.

40:30.780 --> 40:33.260
You know, I said it was originally funded by the NSA.

40:33.260 --> 40:38.420
So you could think if you go back enough through the interconnections of the American

40:38.420 --> 40:42.100
elite. But it's not possible to right now.

40:42.100 --> 40:48.260
It's that the information that is selected, you know, it's not possible to use to

40:48.260 --> 40:54.780
build some, you know, I don't know, a cooperative project built upon the data

40:54.780 --> 40:57.540
that is being collected because they are protecting it.

40:57.580 --> 41:03.540
Well, not just that is that what we've all been using Google for 20 odd years and

41:03.540 --> 41:05.100
building up its knowledge base.

41:05.700 --> 41:09.740
That's the key thing. If you could, you could theoretically build a better search

41:09.740 --> 41:15.180
engine. But what you wouldn't have is 20 years of searches done by millions of

41:15.180 --> 41:19.820
people. And that's what gives it its edge over anybody else is that embedded

41:19.820 --> 41:20.980
knowledge, which everybody has.

41:21.420 --> 41:26.860
We've all helped build Google or Apple or Amazon or any of these companies.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.380
So it is in a way they are socialized.

41:29.380 --> 41:31.540
It's just how they're socialized.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.220
They're not. It's like, again, it's not the Austrian school.

41:35.220 --> 41:38.140
It's all about the individual consumer.

41:40.420 --> 41:43.700
But that's actually not how society we're talking about millions, billions of

41:43.700 --> 41:49.700
people collectively creating something, how it's captured and molded.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.460
That's a completely different question.

41:51.820 --> 41:54.500
But I don't think I think socialization is the wrong word.

41:54.660 --> 41:55.820
Oh, really interesting.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.380
They already socialized.

41:57.380 --> 41:58.620
They've been socialized.

41:58.780 --> 41:59.900
They've always been socialized.

41:59.900 --> 42:03.540
They were socialized when they were funded at Stanford University.

42:04.140 --> 42:07.580
The corporations are social institutions.

42:07.620 --> 42:09.260
They just run as dictatorships.

42:10.100 --> 42:15.820
Well, I think with the word socialized, I associate the common ownership, you know,

42:15.820 --> 42:20.660
that everybody would have access to the benefits of it.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.300
Well, you do. You do with Google.

42:22.460 --> 42:23.060
You can use it.

42:23.060 --> 42:28.860
Well, yeah, I can I can use it to Google something by which I just add some more

42:28.860 --> 42:32.940
of the information to their databases.

42:33.180 --> 42:35.180
But we want to get our hands on the databases.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.300
And you benefit from that.

42:36.340 --> 42:40.220
The fact that they've accumulated all this knowledge, you type something rather

42:40.220 --> 42:42.540
esoteric into it, it suddenly throws up.

42:42.540 --> 42:46.780
I mean, a lot of it is junk, but then by going through it and sort you help them

42:46.780 --> 42:51.340
sort it by what's relevant and the next person who types in the same piece of

42:51.340 --> 42:54.620
rubbish gets a more hopefully gets a more accurate feeding.

42:54.620 --> 42:55.740
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:55.740 --> 43:00.300
But still, I do not get it because I mean, if you take some industry and it

43:00.300 --> 43:05.620
builds some houses and I can profit by living in this house, it's still the the

43:05.620 --> 43:08.820
company that builds the houses is not socialized because the means of

43:08.820 --> 43:13.420
production are not within common ownership.

43:13.420 --> 43:15.740
So so that would be different.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.420
It is a form of common ownership.

43:17.940 --> 43:18.540
Come again, sir.

43:18.540 --> 43:19.820
It is a form of common ownership.

43:19.820 --> 43:21.460
It's just run as a dictatorship.

43:21.460 --> 43:26.620
It's not in the in the sorts of Austrian school fantasy economics that you're

43:26.620 --> 43:28.860
taught at school or even Keynesian.

43:28.860 --> 43:31.860
But you are always treated as an individual.

43:31.860 --> 43:35.060
It's all about individual consumers, individual producers.

43:35.780 --> 43:39.340
But that's why the joint stock company becomes an immediate problem.

43:39.340 --> 43:43.620
You know, there's, I don't know, the theory of the firm and all that sort of stuff.

43:43.620 --> 43:46.980
I mean, one of that thing is that they prove that companies by definition can

43:46.980 --> 43:48.820
be more efficient than markets.

43:48.820 --> 43:52.580
That's what Adam Smith says at the beginning of volume one of The Wealth of Nations.

43:52.580 --> 43:54.940
There's two ways of dividing and distributing labor.

43:54.940 --> 43:55.740
One is the market.

43:55.740 --> 44:00.740
The other is the firm or the state, depending on how you look at it, the plan,

44:00.740 --> 44:03.100
whatever you call it, then there's two different ways.

44:03.100 --> 44:06.340
And so this is not something new that you can know.

44:06.340 --> 44:08.460
The pin factory is not a market.

44:08.900 --> 44:11.740
They don't buy and sell each the bits of the pin to each other.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.500
But you could do it like that.

44:13.500 --> 44:16.620
Theoretically, I mean, to a high equity, you think that's actually how you do it.

44:16.620 --> 44:18.460
They don't want to have the firm at all, really.

44:18.460 --> 44:22.980
They just want to have everything, you know, internal markets for everything.

44:23.420 --> 44:26.300
There are people who tried that miserably.

44:26.300 --> 44:27.980
I know they tried it at our university.

44:27.980 --> 44:31.180
They were going to have a sort of bidding for office space in the same way.

44:31.180 --> 44:31.660
Really?

44:31.740 --> 44:32.860
Oh, yeah, you know, it was just like this.

44:32.860 --> 44:35.500
It was like the I think it was actually was the Blair period

44:35.500 --> 44:39.340
where they got even more bizarrely entranced by all this.

44:40.140 --> 44:44.460
But you can see again, you can see that in the EU where markets

44:44.460 --> 44:48.860
become a sort of technocratic solution because they're not democratic by definition.

44:49.860 --> 44:53.500
And, you know, you want to have a solution and it all looks very nice.

44:53.500 --> 44:57.580
You know, you can just set down a set of policies and it works in the university.

44:59.300 --> 45:00.940
So I think I think that's the problem.

45:00.940 --> 45:04.060
So when you think or talk about socializing, something like that,

45:04.060 --> 45:05.260
they already are social.

45:05.260 --> 45:07.500
It's just that they're not democratic or open.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.220
That's the key thing.

45:08.220 --> 45:13.020
So what you should be talking about is democratizing them or opening them up

45:13.020 --> 45:14.540
and sharing the knowledge.

45:15.180 --> 45:19.900
That's also, I think, very new because our starting point somehow was

45:19.900 --> 45:22.940
that the need for new imaginaries.

45:22.940 --> 45:29.100
And I think this is a very nice imaginary to democratize economies, you know.

45:29.100 --> 45:32.620
So, you know, I have worked with a colleague called Christian Fuchs.

45:32.620 --> 45:34.220
He's a very, you know, very smart guy.

45:34.220 --> 45:38.460
But he was going on about nationalizing Google, basically.

45:38.460 --> 45:39.820
And that's what friends of mine pulled out.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.180
One, it basically is national.

45:41.180 --> 45:44.700
It's one sense it is nationalized because it's because of its connection

45:44.700 --> 45:47.260
with the security apparatus.

45:47.260 --> 45:51.100
And the second thing, the whole point isn't actually to get away from

45:51.100 --> 45:55.980
that type of model of software, you know, having one giant big server,

45:56.540 --> 45:59.340
basically, model of software.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.900
I mean, they, you know, they write the software.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.380
So they would say, well, that's part of the problem.

46:04.380 --> 46:09.260
Yes, just turning it from nominally owned by its two founders

46:09.260 --> 46:13.660
and Wall Street Investor, the venture capitalists or whatever.

46:13.660 --> 46:17.500
I think actually, I think it is basically owned by the two founders nowadays

46:17.500 --> 46:20.460
because all the rest of the shares don't actually have any voting right.

46:20.460 --> 46:21.900
But it doesn't really matter.

46:22.540 --> 46:26.860
It's actually the model of centralizing all the information in one company

46:26.860 --> 46:27.580
is the problem.

46:27.580 --> 46:31.260
And really what you want to do is have, you know, distributed forms of,

46:32.940 --> 46:36.060
if you were to do a search engine, it should be a distributed search engine,

46:36.060 --> 46:39.660
not this particular model that came out of the 1990s.

46:40.220 --> 46:43.020
So I think that's an interesting debate where they're actually saying,

46:43.020 --> 46:46.620
well, you know, it's not just taking the same technology

46:46.620 --> 46:49.740
and just changing the ownership to, you know, Google,

46:50.700 --> 46:57.260
PLC or private, you know, private corporation to state corporation.

46:57.260 --> 46:59.740
Or it's something more than that.

46:59.740 --> 47:03.660
Or even calling it a co-op, you know, a co-op of its workers or something.

47:03.660 --> 47:06.700
It's actually to change the technology itself.

47:06.700 --> 47:10.860
The part of the problem is that it's designed as top-down technology.

47:10.860 --> 47:14.060
And so simply just changing the ownership, calling it socialized.

47:14.620 --> 47:19.660
It's like, as I said, it's like thinking, it's like Confucian socialism, isn't it?

47:20.140 --> 47:21.500
The form of Confucian socialism.

47:23.100 --> 47:27.340
And what you really want to do is actually not only change its ownership,

47:27.340 --> 47:32.540
but change the type of software and the way the software operates in the network.

47:32.540 --> 47:37.020
And again, I'm not an expert in software or hardware,

47:37.020 --> 47:39.660
but this seems to be a very interesting idea.

47:39.660 --> 47:41.980
When we come back to the shaping of technology,

47:42.860 --> 47:46.780
that it looks, you know, we go around doing things because it's,

47:46.860 --> 47:51.020
you know, lots of social relations are embedded in the technologies that we use,

47:51.740 --> 47:52.940
hardwares and software.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.620
And so we just adopt type of behavior patterns

47:56.620 --> 48:03.180
because it's essentially, that's how it's the easy way to operate your life, basically.

48:03.740 --> 48:07.900
And it's teaching you to operate in a sense of social relation.

48:07.900 --> 48:11.020
So simply to, you know, declare Google red.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.860
It's not going to make, it's actually not going to solve the problem.

48:14.860 --> 48:16.140
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

48:16.140 --> 48:18.700
So he already distributes his project for free anyway.

48:20.220 --> 48:21.180
It is communism.

48:21.180 --> 48:21.660
It's free.

48:23.820 --> 48:26.220
I think they charged me five euros to go to that exhibition.

48:26.220 --> 48:27.580
I thought that was quite overrunning, really.

48:28.300 --> 48:29.020
The moza?

48:29.020 --> 48:29.740
Ah, yeah, yeah.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.980
I said, socialism should be free, mate.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.460
They haven't got to communism yet.

48:36.460 --> 48:39.020
They're obviously just in the transitional phase, aren't they?

48:39.020 --> 48:40.940
Where they still have to charge you money to go in.

48:41.740 --> 48:45.500
Oh, another approach that is currently discussed,

48:45.500 --> 48:50.060
or actually since like three or four years is being put out there

48:50.060 --> 48:54.700
and that I wanted to check what your position is towards,

48:54.700 --> 48:59.100
is this concept of fully automated luxury communism by Aaron Bastani.

48:59.100 --> 49:00.140
Oh yeah, that's wonderful.

49:00.140 --> 49:01.660
I read that book.

49:01.660 --> 49:05.260
I actually had to debate with Aaron on his books.

49:05.260 --> 49:06.780
Oh, I'll have to check that one.

49:06.780 --> 49:07.660
Is there a video?

49:07.660 --> 49:08.540
Yeah, sure it is.

49:09.180 --> 49:12.620
It was done in Newspeak House.

49:15.420 --> 49:18.700
Okay, I have to get my hands on this audio or video recording.

49:19.500 --> 49:21.500
It was done for virtual futures.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.020
That's what I'm trying to think.

49:23.020 --> 49:24.860
All right, so you like the book.

49:24.860 --> 49:25.820
You like the concept.

49:26.460 --> 49:27.340
How do I like the book?

49:27.340 --> 49:28.300
That's a really good question.

49:28.300 --> 49:29.420
I was being very polite.

49:30.620 --> 49:31.900
I could have been nastier to it.

49:31.900 --> 49:33.660
But I think the good thing,

49:33.660 --> 49:35.340
I think there's lots of problems with the book.

49:35.340 --> 49:37.820
I mean, there's all the things like mining asteroids,

49:37.820 --> 49:39.660
which are completely bonkers in my view.

49:41.100 --> 49:42.300
But that's a different question.

49:42.300 --> 49:44.860
I think what's good about it is it's very positive.

49:44.860 --> 49:46.860
And what you need, as you said,

49:46.860 --> 49:49.900
in a way it's not so much whether or not you agree with the utopia.

49:51.820 --> 49:54.140
It's whether it's the fact that people are going out and saying,

49:54.140 --> 49:56.700
well, we can build a post-capitalist society.

49:56.700 --> 50:00.060
It's very technological determinism.

50:00.060 --> 50:01.260
That's my problem with it.

50:02.460 --> 50:07.100
Because I think, and I just have been, as I said,

50:07.180 --> 50:08.300
having read capital,

50:08.300 --> 50:11.020
I have a big problem with the words fully automated.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.860
Because I think that that actually is a vision

50:14.860 --> 50:17.580
of being dominated by technology.

50:18.220 --> 50:21.100
Because that's not reshaping the machine.

50:21.100 --> 50:25.100
That's expelling living labor from the production process,

50:25.100 --> 50:26.300
which you don't want to do.

50:26.300 --> 50:30.860
What you want to be able to do is control the production of goods and services.

50:32.300 --> 50:34.780
That's like, you know, it's like basic income.

50:35.580 --> 50:37.740
I always feel this is a very dubious concept.

50:37.740 --> 50:39.180
Because, you know, welfare for all.

50:39.180 --> 50:40.860
That's quite good when you're in a 20-year thing.

50:40.860 --> 50:41.340
That's great.

50:41.340 --> 50:45.020
I could just go and collect a cheque every week and have fun.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.340
But I don't think that really, you know,

50:47.340 --> 50:50.940
what you really want to do is have basic services.

50:50.940 --> 50:53.900
You know, the good example in Britain is that health care is free.

50:53.900 --> 50:56.220
And so, in fact, she would have loved to privatize.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.060
If we'd had charging for health care,

50:58.060 --> 51:00.140
we'd have really expensive health care now.

51:00.140 --> 51:02.300
But because it was free, she couldn't do it.

51:02.300 --> 51:04.540
They can try and privatize the back end.

51:04.540 --> 51:09.180
But if you tried to introduce charging for health care in England,

51:09.180 --> 51:12.460
there'd be a revolt, even among right-wing voters.

51:13.100 --> 51:14.700
And so, that's a really interesting thing.

51:14.700 --> 51:21.020
So, there was a discussion in the 1980s about abolishing public transport fares,

51:22.300 --> 51:25.740
which I spoke in favor of when they edited this.

51:25.740 --> 51:27.740
And the unions didn't want to do this

51:27.740 --> 51:30.940
because there were people involved in selling and collecting tickets.

51:31.900 --> 51:36.060
And but if they'd abolished fares, they couldn't reintroduce them.

51:36.060 --> 51:39.180
I just think now we have very expensive public transport in London.

51:39.180 --> 51:40.540
But I think if they abolished it,

51:42.220 --> 51:45.260
it's very, very difficult to reintroduce it once it's done.

51:45.260 --> 51:47.260
That's a very good point you're making, I guess,

51:47.260 --> 51:51.340
because that would be an essential first step would be

51:51.340 --> 51:58.940
to create universal basic services for housing, for transport, for education, for health,

51:58.940 --> 52:06.540
and really build thick structures around it that are able to last for a long, long time.

52:06.540 --> 52:11.580
And thereby, what's the same with universities, because university used to be free.

52:11.580 --> 52:13.180
And then it is here exactly.

52:13.180 --> 52:15.740
And then Blair introduced very low fees.

52:15.740 --> 52:17.660
And there were people making excuses.

52:17.660 --> 52:21.340
And I remember saying at the time, well, if you introduce low fees, they'll be higher.

52:21.340 --> 52:23.980
Because that's the point is just to get people used to paying something.

52:24.620 --> 52:27.260
And once you pay something, then you can charge them 50 grand a year.

52:27.820 --> 52:28.780
And that is the point.

52:28.780 --> 52:33.340
So I think one of the things is taking things out of the market,

52:33.340 --> 52:37.820
the basic things in life, health care, education, housing.

52:37.820 --> 52:42.300
And then you can have, you know, then people want to buy and sell other things.

52:42.300 --> 52:42.940
That's fine.

52:44.220 --> 52:46.380
What's the next step after that?

52:47.100 --> 52:49.900
Let's imagine a future where this has happened.

52:49.900 --> 52:54.460
Where our children, where our little children are going to do.

52:54.460 --> 52:58.940
Do a Keynesian, the future of my grandchildren kind of thing.

52:58.940 --> 53:00.140
What would that be?

53:01.180 --> 53:01.580
What do you mean?

53:01.580 --> 53:04.700
The four-day week, the three-day week, you know, that sort of thing.

53:04.700 --> 53:09.900
The Labour Party has actually adopted a policy of introducing a four-day week.

53:09.900 --> 53:10.300
Yeah.

53:10.300 --> 53:12.860
Which again, it's one of the mistakes the French Socialist Party did is

53:12.860 --> 53:16.220
they reduced the working week, but not by a whole day.

53:16.220 --> 53:21.260
And so they actually, it's been very difficult in France to push work back up again.

53:21.980 --> 53:24.940
And it doesn't seem to have affected the French economy that hugely.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.820
But they always have, if you read right-wing papers,

53:27.820 --> 53:30.220
they're always going on and on about the restriction on the working week.

53:30.220 --> 53:34.780
But you think if they give them the whole extra day off, that would have really screwed.

53:34.780 --> 53:38.940
Because, you know, they've never been able to, even the Popular Front in the 1930s,

53:38.940 --> 53:43.100
the 1936 Front Popular, they introduced the Grand Vacances,

53:43.900 --> 53:51.100
which, so basically France closes down in August, thanks to the workers' rebellion in 1936.

53:51.900 --> 53:53.900
It's a bit annoying sometimes when you're a tourist,

53:54.860 --> 53:56.540
but you do think that was an achievement.

53:56.540 --> 53:57.900
And the same thing in England.

53:57.900 --> 54:05.100
We basically, from Christmas Eve to past New Year's Eve, the whole of England closes down.

54:05.100 --> 54:07.660
And this is from the 1970s strikes.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.900
We had all these massive strikes.

54:09.900 --> 54:15.180
And the great achievement, even now, despite all these decades of neoliberalism,

54:15.180 --> 54:21.020
is the whole country closes down on Christmas Eve and doesn't reopen until after New Year's Day.

54:22.060 --> 54:24.940
So those sorts of spaces, I think, are really interesting.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.580
It's interesting, though, things like National Health Service and

54:27.580 --> 54:29.500
the long winter Christmas holiday.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.620
Those are essentially what they find really difficult to roll back,

54:32.620 --> 54:37.340
that shows you what really powerful achievements that people aren't really willing to give up,

54:37.340 --> 54:41.100
however much shit they're reading from the mainstream media.

54:42.540 --> 54:47.020
So we've got this, like, next step thing,

54:47.020 --> 54:51.500
which would be the Universal Baker's Basic Services kind of thing.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.380
And a shorter working week.

54:54.380 --> 54:56.140
I think that would make people happy.

54:56.140 --> 54:59.900
And then after that, if we get that, if we get a four-day week,

55:01.260 --> 55:04.700
same payment, of course, then a three-day week, and then...

55:05.820 --> 55:07.580
What do you mean, ecotopia?

55:07.580 --> 55:08.300
I don't know.

55:08.300 --> 55:09.500
Where do we go from there?

55:09.500 --> 55:13.580
You know, what are you pushing for?

55:13.580 --> 55:16.620
We hunt in the morning and read poetry in the afternoon.

55:17.100 --> 55:20.060
Yeah, I mean, that would be one of the...

55:20.780 --> 55:24.300
Not finalists, of course, the wrong term and the wrong idea to it.

55:24.300 --> 55:25.260
But that would be a...

55:25.900 --> 55:29.580
Charles Fourier, who thought he should overcome the division of labour.

55:29.580 --> 55:30.380
That's what he...

55:30.380 --> 55:32.620
Every four hours, you'd switch jobs or...

55:33.260 --> 55:36.780
Yeah, but you needn't have to do that, you know?

55:38.300 --> 55:44.060
For me, at least, there's an inner image where I'm free to

55:44.700 --> 55:49.980
do the work that I intrinsically want to do.

55:49.980 --> 55:52.060
And I'm not a lazy person.

55:52.060 --> 55:56.140
I just want to decide myself what I want to put my efforts in.

55:56.140 --> 55:59.260
And also, people like being with other people.

55:59.260 --> 56:03.100
And if they got a collective project that's to the social benefit,

56:03.100 --> 56:04.700
it makes them feel happy doing it.

56:04.700 --> 56:05.180
Yeah, yeah.

56:05.180 --> 56:07.980
I mean, that's the difficulty is how do you turn

56:08.540 --> 56:12.220
the sort of production of goods and services that we have

56:12.220 --> 56:14.300
into a society which is democratic?

56:14.300 --> 56:17.260
Because it's been so built on class hierarchy.

56:18.140 --> 56:21.020
It's funny that here you get people who claim that this isn't a class...

56:21.020 --> 56:24.300
They say, oh, England's terrible, it's divided into classes

56:24.300 --> 56:26.140
as if Austria isn't divided.

56:26.140 --> 56:27.980
I just look at them with that absolutely black...

56:27.980 --> 56:29.260
I think you just...

56:29.260 --> 56:32.220
Obviously, again, the ideology here is, you know,

56:32.220 --> 56:33.980
it's all social consensus, everyone's happy.

56:35.500 --> 56:38.300
There are still people, you know, in the hotel, cleaning the hotel,

56:38.700 --> 56:42.380
I mean, waiting in bars.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.660
So let's, I mean, maybe it's counterproductive,

56:45.660 --> 56:48.860
but still I have to ask, let's put a name tag on it.

56:48.860 --> 56:50.060
Communism.

56:50.060 --> 56:51.020
All right.

56:51.020 --> 56:52.460
Just to annoy Americans.

56:53.500 --> 56:56.780
I used to call myself communist until I started going to America as an adult.

56:56.780 --> 56:57.420
And then you really...

56:57.420 --> 56:59.900
Because you say anything left with you, you try and explain,

56:59.900 --> 57:02.380
no, I'm a social democrat or a...

57:02.380 --> 57:05.260
Whatever, then you just gave up and just say, no, I'm a communist.

57:05.260 --> 57:07.420
And then they get, I mean, probably not now,

57:07.420 --> 57:09.340
but I always remember that people would be really shocked.

57:09.340 --> 57:13.500
They never met anybody who actually would say this

57:13.500 --> 57:16.700
and not be, you know, a Stalivist or something.

57:16.700 --> 57:17.340
Yeah.

57:17.340 --> 57:20.380
And I just recently heard that, because I'm really interested,

57:20.380 --> 57:26.140
I heard that there are people calling themselves radical social democrats.

57:26.140 --> 57:28.060
I never heard of that before, but I just recently heard...

57:28.060 --> 57:29.020
Oh, this one of mine used to say,

57:29.020 --> 57:31.260
we should call ourselves libertarian social democrats,

57:31.260 --> 57:32.620
because that's LSD.

57:33.340 --> 57:35.340
Okay, I see.

57:35.340 --> 57:38.780
So I've got the class of the new, how's this at the end, libertarian social,

57:38.780 --> 57:39.660
because it was his joke.

57:39.660 --> 57:40.860
And I just thought it was such a great...

57:40.860 --> 57:43.740
And the funny thing is the only person who got the joke were the Russians.

57:43.740 --> 57:47.020
The Russians got the joke immediately and no one else did.

57:48.860 --> 57:49.740
They all got the joke.

57:50.540 --> 57:52.300
One last question I'm always asking.

57:52.300 --> 57:55.020
If you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

57:56.300 --> 57:57.100
My little boy.

57:58.300 --> 57:59.740
I think he's my little...

57:59.740 --> 58:00.620
He's my future.

58:01.100 --> 58:04.620
Some Christian came up to me outside the shopping centre and said,

58:04.620 --> 58:06.060
what happened to you?

58:06.060 --> 58:07.580
Will you live on after death?

58:07.580 --> 58:09.980
And I pointed to Artie and said, look, here he is.

58:13.100 --> 58:15.980
I think, well, yeah, he makes you optimistic.

58:15.980 --> 58:19.580
You see them crying up, hopefully he leaves them a better world.

58:20.460 --> 58:21.900
Richard, thanks a lot.

58:21.900 --> 58:22.780
Cheers, thank you.

58:23.660 --> 58:24.860
Long live Red Vienna.
