0	16000	Welcome everybody to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and today you'll hear a recording of a panel I organized and moderated in February 2020 as part of my research fellowship at the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society.
16000	30000	The panel critically discusses the expansion of cryptoeconomics into an art of government and I am very happy that I was able to bring together Jaya, Clara Brecke, Benjamin Seibel and Martin Köppelmann as panelists.
30000	38000	Jaya and Benjamin have both been guests to Future Histories before, so check out their episodes as well.
38000	57000	I'd like to send my warmest thanks and greetings to the research group 17 at the Weizenbaum Institute who hosted my stay there and greetings actually to everybody at the Weizenbaum because I really, really, really enjoyed my stay there and I loved the many interesting and inspiring discussions.
57000	63000	It was an actually perfect research environment, I have to say. So thanks a lot.
63000	74000	And since I am actually already in the mode of wholehearted gratitude, I'd like to thank Ludwig and welcome him as a Patreon of Future Histories.
74000	83000	And I'd like to thank Vicky, Fabian and Bernhard for their contributions. Thanks a thousand times. This really helps a lot.
83000	91000	But now, please enjoy the panel Dime and Punishment, Cryptoeconomics as an Art of Government.
96000	110000	I'm very happy to have the opportunity to host this panel tonight with this awesome guest, which I'm really excited about to bring together. It's Jaya, Clara Brecke, Benjamin Seibel and Martin Köppelmann.
110000	113000	Maybe you could introduce yourself just a little.
113000	118000	Sure. Hello, everyone. I'm Jaya.
118000	127000	I have been kind of tracing the emergence of the field of crypto economics pretty much since the beginning of Ethereum.
127000	132000	I started writing a PhD that was a political analysis of blockchain.
132000	136000	I wanted to understand how can you understand something like blockchain politically?
136000	141000	And that was right around the time when Ethereum had its first DEVCON.
141000	161000	And so for me, it's been kind of a curious journey of understanding the ways that I guess like kind of existing or kind of historical economic theories are rehashed and reconfigured through the development of protocols that actually come from a very different set of concerns,
161000	166000	namely usually kind of security questions, network security questions.
166000	176000	So this kind of interesting mishmash and the emergence of crypto economics as a field that's kind of distinct from previous economic ideas.
176000	183000	That's, I guess, like broadly my interest, but in relation to this panel anyway.
183000	189000	But yeah, within that, I also kind of look more at, I guess, power dynamics, questions of governance, this kind of thing, too.
190000	200000	That's a brief. So right now I'm doing a postdoc at Durham University, but I am on strike today, so I do not represent Durham University.
200000	203000	They're not paying me to be here.
203000	216000	I'm here as a general interested person that is kind of following this field and writes a lot about this field, speaks a lot about this field.
216000	221000	Yeah. Hi, I'm Benjamin.
221000	232000	Well, Jan invited me here as, I guess, an expert on governmental technologies because I wrote a book about it a few years ago.
232000	244000	A PhD thesis about cybernetics, actually, and the influence it had on governmental discourses in the postwar periods, like from 1945 to 1970, basically.
244000	257000	So very early, the emergence of digital technologies, but also of a kind of theoretical discourse around these technologies and how it influenced politics and governmental thinking in this period.
257000	268000	And I think we still see the consequences of these developments today, or maybe we even see them just today more than in the past.
268000	277000	Anyway, I no longer work in academia and also not an expert on crypto economics, but Jan told me that is just fine.
277000	281000	So I hope I still can contribute something to the discussion.
281000	287000	I work in civic tech and technology activism, basically here in Berlin for about five years now.
287000	299000	I also work a lot with the government on digital developments and how to implement these technologies in a way that benefits citizens.
299000	302000	Yeah, I'm Martin Kuppelmann.
302000	314000	I'm a software engineer and interested in blockchain, first Bitcoin eight years ago or something like that, and then mainly Ethereum.
314000	319000	I founded the project or company now called Gnosis.
319000	330000	We are building prediction markets and a bunch of other infrastructure and markets on Ethereum.
330000	352000	Another side project I initiated is a project called Circles, where we're trying to advance the course of universal basic income via blockchain technology and introducing new currencies.
352000	360000	I hope somehow for me, it totally makes sense to bring together all these specific people, actually.
360000	368000	And the umbrella is the title of this panel tonight, Diamond Punishment Cryptoeconomics as an Art of Government.
368000	378000	I'm quite sure that not everybody is familiar with the topic, so I think we should kind of lay out some basic thoughts about it.
378000	385000	Maybe let's simply start with the definition of cryptoeconomics, Jaya, do you want to start?
385000	401000	Yes, well, I guess, you know, I'm not going to give you a kind of like little spiffy one liner, but more just to say that I guess the easiest way to describe cryptoeconomics is to trace it back to Bitcoin mining basically.
401000	413000	And the idea of using, you know, on a very basic level, economic incentives and rewards in order to achieve certain network security characteristics in a decentralized peer to peer network scenario.
413000	423000	And that is like, you know, that's been done, you know, that's kind of been a kind of field of experimentation ever since then.
423000	436000	And has added more and more economic concepts, more and more ideas around how markets function and so on that I'm sure Martin can say a lot more about in terms of the practical experiments that's been done around that.
436000	452000	But I think for me, what's interesting about that is that, you know, I come from a background, a kind of theoretical and political background that's extremely critical of the use of markets in trying to kind of govern social relations.
452000	462000	And I remain very critical of that, you know, I think there's a severe limitation to what markets can and should do in societies.
462000	471000	Nevertheless, I think it's like a super interesting field to look at how it interacts exactly with network security and network security protocols.
471000	479000	And so, you know, I follow these experiments with with lots of interest and openness to.
479000	500000	One of the reasons why I'm interested in cryptoeconomics as an art of government is kind of more or less recent development where these types of actually design these design paradigms of cryptoeconomics reach over into the sphere of the social even more and are proclaimed to become a new social technology.
500000	511000	There's this collaboration between Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, one of the largest blockchain platforms, and an economist called Glenn Whale.
511000	527000	And they kind of joined forces and more or less tried to develop tried to develop a what they call political theory based on radical markets, which are actually markets based on mechanism design.
527000	538000	And yeah, mostly on mechanism design, which is a type of game theoretical thinking and the combination with blockchain technology and cryptoeconomics.
538000	547000	And this is proclaimed to become a new social technology, which can create some kind of legitimacy within a space of anonymity.
547000	552000	And before the panel, that's the that's the idea roughly.
552000	558000	Not sure about that. In that particular context, I'm not sure about the anonymity.
558000	560000	I think. Yeah, that's true.
560000	566000	In that case, they very clearly say we need identity and one person, one vote and stuff like that.
566000	567000	Yeah, it's true.
568000	587000	Why I'm making this this longer introduction is I'd be keen on your position of what you think that cryptoeconomics actually is, because when we were talking before the panel, you kind of sketched it in a kind of broader sense, also political sense.
587000	598000	Yeah. Yeah, I'm again, I have not really thought or it's I guess just just feeling it's not not trying to to define those terms.
598000	610000	But a few few things that come to my mind when I when I think about it is, first of all, that we have a space where there there is no arbitrator or judge.
610000	619000	So like like if we are here interacting with each other, there's always the assumption whatever we do, there is a state and there is something above us.
619000	635000	And if we do some form of interaction, if I go into a shop and buy something, then then the interaction is not just defined by the two of us, but it's defined by a whole construct above us.
636000	646000	And in those blockchain in the blockchain world, we're trying to make interactions between possible.
646000	655000	We are trying to make interactions between people possible, even in the absence of such an overarching state.
655000	675000	And the very practical consequences is that something as simple as as having ten people that are somewhere in the world and let's say ten different countries and they together want to have a bank account.
675000	680000	So they together want to say, OK, we have here a thousand dollars and we want to control that together.
680000	687000	That would be extremely complex to set up outside of blockchain.
687000	694000	I mean, you could, I mean, you could, I guess, form a company, but that would need to be in one restriction.
694000	704000	And then it would be what cost you thousands, maybe ten thousand dollars to just maybe much more to set up such a construct in blockchain world.
704000	707000	That's super easy and cost you 20 cents.
707000	718000	So you can just do what it's called the multisig, some shared account that that where the money sits and it's controlled by by by ten people.
718000	725000	And there can be basic rules like five or ten agree, then the money can be can be taken.
726000	742000	And so I would define crypto economics as a space that can enforce rules without without such a government arbitrator that, of course, has consequences or like one is that it's always opt in.
742000	751000	So in my view, so far, yeah, if I'm born in Germany, I don't have a choice to kind of pay taxes or not.
751000	757000	Kind of I'm kind of forced to play by the rules that that exist here.
757000	771000	I would say so far in crypto economics, it's always an active decision to kind of, yeah, put something under those rules, which comes with the flip side that you usually first have to
771000	778000	put something in kind of which means mainly you have to first put in value.
778000	791000	So unless you put in value or money or something money like usually you will not be able to to do to do anything.
791000	794000	I mean, then there may be a few more.
794000	799000	So so I think the what you mentioned was was game theory.
799000	801000	I would maybe call it adversarial thinking.
801000	819000	So like when when those systems are designed, I think the general mindset is that they try to build systems that work under worst case assumptions.
819000	832000	So if I would just try to make one real world example, I think that like in the US, there were there were those primaries or the Democratic primaries.
832000	835000	And I think there was a mess up like that.
835000	843000	They couldn't count the votes and someone designing crypto economic system would immediately say, OK, it's basically just those two guys who then report to that.
843000	846000	That's a terrible system. That's kind of just those two guys.
846000	848000	They would enough to collude.
848000	860000	So we would kind of just from the mindset directly come with a different mindset and come with a mindset that tries to build systems that are more resilient.
860000	863000	I guess that's very interesting.
863000	879000	And I think because we will come to a part of critique, actually, and I'll be keen on on looking at the at the assumptions, the anthropologies, so to speak, that are inscribed within this this type of thinking.
879000	884000	Because to me, it's even kind of paranoid somehow.
884000	889000	And then that's specifically problematic when it comes to designing social spaces.
889000	892000	You know, you always think that the next guy might stab you in the back.
892000	898000	Yeah, but I want to be more generous, actually, towards the whole thing.
898000	908000	Before we get there, I'd like to ask Benjamin to maybe introduce us to the second part of the title, because it's Diamond Punishment Crypto Economics as an Art of Government.
908000	911000	In German, that would be Regierungskunst.
911000	919000	And Benjamin actually wrote quite a lot about the question of technology in relation to Regierungskunst.
919000	923000	Could you maybe kind of brief us about it?
923000	930000	I could try. Yeah, it's already hard to sum up a book in a few sentences, but when it's been five years, it's even harder.
931000	941000	When I started to write about the relation of technology and government, I found that on the one hand, throughout the history of political or governmental thinking,
941000	946000	you would always find these metaphors or models of machinery as the state.
946000	954000	So even in past centuries, you would find these conceptions of the state being like a ship or like a clockwork or like a steam engine.
954000	965000	And in the 20th century, of course, this gets replaced by looking at the state as kind of an information processing system or look at societies as kind of information processing systems.
965000	977000	And these models have kind of a very bad reputation in political thinking, especially in like leftist political thinking, because they always look very reductionist, which they are, of course.
977000	983000	So lots of very smart political thinkers actually assumed that these models were just wrong,
983000	995000	which I found not satisfying because it was so obvious that these models actually had a huge impact on the way that government was thought,
995000	1000000	but also how government was practiced because these technologies are not just like ideas.
1000000	1007000	They are like materialities that can also be used as tools to actually govern people because governing people,
1007000	1015000	and this is an idea that you will find in Foucault most prominently, is a very technological thing to do in a way.
1015000	1022000	It's about control. It's about regulation. It's about setting environments where people can be regulated in some way.
1022000	1030000	And of course, those people in power or governments can also use technologies as actual tools.
1030000	1037000	So it's not just like we imagine society to be an information network, but once you imagine society to be an information network,
1037000	1043000	you can use computers or information networks to actually start controlling people through computers.
1044000	1052000	The same way that, for example, Friedrich the Great tried to imagine his state as a clockwork
1052000	1058000	and control the people through discipline in a way like clockworks.
1058000	1067000	So what I realized was that technologies or technological assemblages, which is more than just the artifacts,
1067000	1078000	also the knowledge surrounding it and so on, that they offer spaces of possibility through which you can attempt to control a society,
1078000	1087000	for example, which is always attempted because government in a way always tries to be at the state of the art of governing.
1087000	1094000	So always trying to implement new technologies, to try new forms in regulating people better or worse.
1094000	1102000	So you have these spaces of possibilities that then also shape your thinking on how you frame the problem.
1102000	1106000	Because for government, society is a problem to be controlled.
1106000	1117000	And the way how you look at this problem, how you look at society is very much influenced from the technical conditions under which you actually operate.
1117000	1126000	So that's what I kind of observed, how this image changed and moved to looking at societies as information systems or communication systems,
1126000	1135000	but also looking at individuals as being rational actors, the whole homo-economics model, basically like computers.
1135000	1143000	How you started to look at individuals as self-regulating actors, lots like a cybernetic machine that works through feedback mechanisms.
1144000	1153000	And then you start experimenting with this framework and with the possibilities that arise and try to figure out new ways of governing.
1153000	1164000	And I think in this context, the whole blockchain thing that is often framed by evangelists as being something very disruptive and very revolutionary
1164000	1173000	is actually just a logical next step that is still in the same framework like the cybernetic discourse of the 1950s was.
1173000	1179000	In that sense, it's not very revolutionary, which doesn't make it good or bad.
1179000	1185000	I would argue to look at it in a longer time span.
1185000	1194000	But still, that would be the question. What specific type of new realm of possibilities is opened up through this technology?
1194000	1200000	Because I said that I want to be a bit more generous. I think there is something being opened up.
1200000	1204000	My immediate response here would be, my perspective would be quite the opposite.
1204000	1210000	You said something like a government wants to basically control or govern people.
1210000	1218000	Well, to me, blockchain is really the possibility of people to cooperate without the government.
1218000	1221000	To control themselves, basically.
1221000	1237000	Yeah, of course. One thing we are dreaming of or working on is there are probably a million or more people in the world that care about climate change.
1237000	1241000	They have no good way to coordinate.
1241000	1251000	There is no good, as mentioned earlier, as soon as you do something international, companies are fine or whatever, what would you do?
1251000	1264000	So to build that level of coordination that is independent of existing power structures, namely states and large corporations.
1264000	1271000	That is the thing that is promising to me.
1271000	1277000	In the last consequence, it could mean getting rid of states.
1277000	1282000	So I would say there is a revolutionary potential.
1283000	1298000	I think for me what has been kind of curious has been the way that blockchain and the idea of decentralization that is advanced through blockchain tends to very much be about...
1298000	1309000	It is a very different way of thinking about revolution because the transformation is less about a qualitative transformation, as in let's do things fundamentally differently.
1309000	1316000	And more about let's decentralize all the existing ways of doing things so people can do that for themselves but in a decentralized way.
1316000	1322000	And that for me is a bit curious. There is a difference there.
1322000	1332000	There is a difference between lots of individuals running their own currencies and their own banks and centralized banks.
1332000	1344000	That is a huge difference, but nevertheless the actual technologies tend to be very much like a replication of the existing ways of thinking about money, value, government.
1344000	1350000	There are some experimentation at the edges, but it seems a little bit like there is...
1350000	1362000	And again, it's sometimes very much a critique of mine, like a very strong critique in the very specific projects, but other times it's also an openness as in that's curious.
1362000	1367000	I don't actually know what that means in terms of how it would play out.
1367000	1385000	But there is a little bit this thing of like there is not a kind of strong conceptual critique of the state or the banking industry as much as it's just centralized and we need to decentralize.
1385000	1395000	So like we look at what they're doing and what they're doing, they're doing, you know, specific things that instead of them doing it, we want everyone to be able to do it, if that makes sense.
1395000	1402000	On a side note, the idea of getting rid of the state is like a key idea in cybernetic governmental thinking.
1402000	1411000	Like in a perfectly controlled social system, you wouldn't need a state because everything would just keep everything in check.
1411000	1418000	So I mean, I'm very fond of the positive or utopian ideas that are in there.
1418000	1425000	But what interests me is aren't we substituting one form of control to another form of control?
1425000	1429000	And how does this new form of control look like?
1429000	1432000	Or what do we do with it?
1432000	1437000	Like 10 years ago, the idea was blockchain decentralized everything.
1437000	1445000	And now it's like Facebook uses a blockchain to kind of decentralize everything, but still keep control of everything with Libra.
1445000	1459000	So I think there's just a lot of work and academic work to do in trying to understand and grasp these decentralized power structures or even how new centralized power structures might emerge from it.
1459000	1463000	Because that's what we learned from the Internet of the last 30 years.
1463000	1468000	A huge utopian emancipatory potential in the 90s.
1468000	1474000	And we were all like, everything gets decentralized and we get rid of the old power structures and now look at the Internet today.
1474000	1476000	I mean, what happened?
1476000	1483000	And I think just we need to work really hard to understand how decentralized power works.
1483000	1494000	Yeah, no, I mean, to some extent, it's technology or technological pieces that can be used in quite a range of ways.
1494000	1514000	So you mentioned kind of like money or there is this project maker on Ethereum, which I would say kind of replicates how today central bank works.
1514000	1520000	To some extent and but at the end, it's maybe not that different.
1520000	1536000	So it's OK, maybe it's 20 large token holders that then vote and instead of the central bank where I don't know, seven people then at the end make the decision.
1536000	1539000	So in that sense, it's not really that different.
1539000	1547000	But blockchain also or the technology just opens up the field for much more experiments.
1547000	1559000	So there is this maker, but there are also a hundred other currencies or currency systems or value systems that are currently being built and experimented.
1559000	1566000	And not only that, there's also loads of experimentation in terms of governance, right?
1566000	1577000	And I mean, not just in terms of kind of governance, like blockchain applications for governance, but more like the governance of blockchain protocols is wild.
1577000	1580000	There's so many problems that keep coming up.
1581000	1596000	And that's like an ongoing that for me is the real stuff, because that for me, like, first of all, has to do with this question of like, OK, we're we're arranging a kind of new decentralized protocol where what happens to power in the meantime.
1596000	1604000	And a lot of that has to do with who determines, you know, whether the protocol is considered to work or be good or not and what need what changes need to be made.
1604000	1614000	So far, like, you know, in terms of any kind of radical changes to protocols, that has to sit within a kind of like attack vector scenario.
1614000	1622000	So it's like if you want to modify the way that a given network is governed, then it needs to be coded into kind of attack vector type language.
1622000	1627000	And then it's something that can actually be dealt with by developers in a sensible way.
1627000	1645000	But the more kind of like the questions of how the protocols actually meet users in, you know, in their day to day lives and how users then push back on whether that protocol is actually performing something good in their lives or not is like still an open question mark in many ways.
1645000	1650000	Again, so far, like, you know, there's been, you know, the hacks and the exploits and so on.
1650000	1658000	And that's like, you know, been the kind of interesting cases of what do you do then?
1658000	1660000	You know, who has the control of the protocol then?
1660000	1663000	And then, of course, like forking as a governance mechanism around that.
1663000	1671000	But yeah, and there's lots of interesting stuff happening right now in terms of protocol governance in the space.
1671000	1674000	I'm still at the point of trying to be generous.
1674000	1683000	I'm still asking myself, what exactly is the thing that crypt economics brings to the table?
1683000	1697000	You know, if you consider all the critique, if you consider that like apart from all the bullshit, apart from all the hype, apart from all the OK, they are using like rational choice assumptions and everything.
1697000	1710000	Is there still something left that opens up new spaces of possibilities, as you mentioned in relation to the question of technology as an art of government?
1710000	1718000	And I'm asking this from a perspective of being like really critical towards all the things.
1718000	1732000	My simplest answer would again be it enables people to cooperate across jurisdictions worldwide in a form that was previously not possible.
1732000	1734000	But can we go into that cooperation a little bit more?
1734000	1738000	Because like, you know, obviously people can call each other, right?
1738000	1747000	And like, you know, you can call someone and organize something, you know, between lots of different locations.
1747000	1754000	So it's a very specific kind of cooperation or collaboration that is enabled through blockchain, not because that communication happens already.
1754000	1758000	Relationships can be established. People can make agreements and so on and so forth.
1758000	1761000	It's more specific than that, right?
1761000	1762000	Well, of course, yeah.
1762000	1769000	And again, one example, the simplest example is just like having control of a budget together.
1769000	1773000	That already is pretty hard to do, I would say.
1773000	1778000	And then you can, of course, go on from there, but just as a...
1778000	1780000	So, yeah, again, this climate change thing.
1780000	1797000	So there is a project, Dowstek, I'm somewhat involved with, where the idea is there are Facebook groups today with a million or sometimes 100,000 million people that are interested in some topic or something like that.
1797000	1800000	But the group is very...
1800000	1807000	But those groups could maybe do much more than or could have much higher impact.
1807000	1813000	So imagine you would pay a one dollar a month membership kind of into this group.
1813000	1823000	And then this group would have a budget and would have some procedures how to, well, then actually be able to spend that money.
1823000	1833000	I have a hard time imagining that how to do this today, kind of how to set that up without blockchain.
1833000	1840000	So that's some specific financial application that can be created through this technology.
1840000	1849000	Because if you take it to a larger level of climate change, I'm not seeing how this is like...
1849000	1852000	How addressing climate change...
1852000	1854000	Greenpeace does that, right?
1854000	1862000	Greenpeace, people pay a membership fee to Greenpeace and then they do stuff on climate and people see that as a kind of coordinating mechanism.
1862000	1874000	And I mean, I get what you're saying that it's easier for smaller groups to self-organize that might not have access to be able to have a bank account and so on and so forth.
1874000	1884000	But the big question here is what is it that the fact that Greenpeace does this versus another set of people...
1884000	1891000	There is a set of governance and legal jurisdictions and all that, which is it can be good, but it can be bad.
1891000	1893000	But sometimes it is quite good.
1893000	1898000	And especially when a given protocol gets hacked, it's quite good.
1899000	1908000	Do you know what I mean? Sometimes there's a fallback onto existing legal systems and existing governance systems.
1908000	1912000	That's like, man, people kind of...
1912000	1915000	OK, I would say that's the second next...
1915000	1922000	If we are still at the basis of what's the promise, then I would say, well, why not Greenpeace?
1922000	1931000	Yeah, I mean, again, I don't know how Greenpeace is structured legally globally.
1931000	1942000	I assume they have in many jurisdictions some entities and I think it has overall probably tremendous costs in just maintaining that legal structure.
1942000	1951000	So that would simply be an enormous reduction of costs of setting up such a structure.
1951000	1960000	And then, of course, the imagination is that it's much more participatory.
1960000	1968000	So instead of just kind of paying a membership fee to Greenpeace and then I think...
1968000	1977000	I'm not a member, but I assume you don't have kind of direct voting rights on stuff and how that money is spent.
1977000	1985000	And I would say that is also because it's just complicated and expensive to set those structures up.
1985000	2002000	And I would say with this technology that those costs to set up governments, governance structures can be reduced significantly.
2002000	2008000	And that makes it just possible to do things that were previously not possible.
2008000	2023000	So one example I sometimes bring in just how the reduction of costs introduces new things is the Internet reduced, of course, the costs of submitting information tremendously.
2023000	2037000	So like 30 years ago, if you wanted to express something as unimportant as you like this picture,
2037000	2041000	well, you would not write a letter to someone and say, I like this picture.
2041000	2043000	With Facebook, of course, you click the like button.
2043000	2051000	And that's kind of one example of the cost of submitting this information was reduced by a factor of 1000 or a million.
2051000	2059000	And with blockchain technology, the costs of not submitting information, but submitting transactions.
2059000	2065000	So sending a token or casting a vote that can trigger something,
2065000	2070000	kind of this transactional cost is reduced by a factor or can be reduced by a factor of a million.
2070000	2075000	And that will open up a new space.
2075000	2078000	I mean, don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't think there's anything interesting about that.
2078000	2081000	I think there's plenty of interesting things. Otherwise, it wouldn't be in the space.
2081000	2088000	But it's more that I find it kind of problematic that there is a lot of kind of discussions that tend to happen in and around blockchain,
2088000	2095000	where it's like, oh, that would be that would never be possible without blockchain or, you know, when actually, yes, things are possible.
2095000	2097000	It just is a different way of doing things.
2097000	2107000	And so there's this tendency to often kind of reduce social interactions to a kind of like very limited set of forms of interactions
2107000	2111000	and kind of reinterpret the whole world through that lens.
2111000	2120000	And that's a little bit like man, come on, you know, like including things like no, sorry, I'll stop there because we'll get into that later.
2120000	2124000	I'm sure questions of the state and sovereignty and all this kind of stuff.
2125000	2133000	I mean, I think we're still in a very early stage where we just where it's important to also explore the possibilities and try out different things.
2133000	2143000	For me, as a non-expert, the promise of blockchain technologies kind of lies in the possibility to design economic systems
2143000	2148000	down to a very micro transactional level and day to day level even.
2148000	2152000	And I think there's huge possibilities, also huge problems there.
2152000	2155000	But in theory, it's lots of interesting things is possible.
2155000	2165000	It's not only that like tax evasion is no longer possible, but maybe also it's no longer possible to spend money on things that, you know, harm other people or harm the environment.
2165000	2170000	Or maybe it's more expensive or maybe it's more expensive tomorrow than it is today.
2170000	2173000	There's, as I said, there are lots of problems come with it.
2173000	2182000	In theory, like compared to how our economic system works now, you can control things on a much tighter level for good or for worse.
2182000	2192000	I mean, on that specific thing, I think tax evasion will come in a way also much easier again.
2192000	2200000	There are those zero knowledge proofs and I mean, like so far, blockchain has been very, very, very transparent.
2200000	2213000	So, but there is already the technology ready to make blockchain or to make transactions that are shielded or like that you cannot.
2213000	2219000	You have a very hard time tracing from the outside what's going on.
2222000	2229000	But I think what Benjamin is actually heading at is that it's a design question that, again, coming from his book,
2229000	2239000	these technologies open up spaces and it's a question of a political conversation, of a political negotiation.
2239000	2241000	Thanks a lot.
2241000	2247000	How we want to use this contingent space of possibility that is being opened up.
2247000	2264000	And I think that one of the problems actually in the space is that the way that the question is looked upon is informed through lenses that I personally mostly do not share.
2264000	2271000	Specifically in cryptoeconomics, there's this lens of game theoretic design, a game theoretic design perspective.
2271000	2281000	And I'd like to talk a bit about this because this actually like builds the floor upon which the rest is then being imagined, actually.
2281000	2284000	And to me, it's like highly flawed.
2284000	2294000	Maybe I mentioned an author, Ariel Rubenstein, and he's actually a renowned economist in the field of cryptoeconomics, but game theory.
2294000	2295000	And he wrote a book.
2295000	2296000	And he wrote a book.
2296000	2298000	It's called Economic Fables.
2298000	2308000	And he talks about game theory from a perspective where he says, all right, I really, really enjoyed game theory as an intellectual pleasure in my professional life.
2308000	2322000	But when it comes to real world applicability, I highly doubt that it's worth anything when it comes to the prediction of real behavior of humans, because it's just not a tool that you can use for this.
2322000	2328000	And then what you end up with is a normative idea of how people should behave.
2328000	2339000	And this I often find in cryptoeconomic systems design that you imagine a way of how you would like that people should behave.
2339000	2351000	And this is mostly thought of as like strictly rational profit maximizing and actually alongside idea of rational choice theory.
2351000	2352000	And that's how it's modeled.
2352000	2362000	And then you build a system that tries to kind of force people to act in this way with a type of carrot and stick approach.
2362000	2363000	That's how it seems to me.
2363000	2365000	I would say quite the opposite.
2365000	2371000	I would say you imagine how people could behave worst case.
2372000	2378000	And then you imagine how the others could behave worst case to you.
2378000	2386000	And then you design the system that even if they all behave worst case for you, it kind of still works.
2386000	2388000	Yeah.
2388000	2391000	I mean, and that is the security engineers perspective.
2391000	2394000	And that I find really interesting to trace through, actually.
2395000	2401000	But there is something else that you said, which was the intellectual pleasure of game theory.
2401000	2409000	And I actually I honestly think that blockchain has become so big because it's intellectually pleasurable.
2409000	2420000	Like, you know, it's just it puts forward a whole bunch of really interesting problems for political theorists, for economists, for mathematicians, for cryptographers, for computer engineers.
2420000	2427000	You know, it's just an interesting set of problems to attack, whether those problems are actual real world problems or not.
2427000	2431000	So, you know, maybe, maybe not.
2431000	2436000	But honestly, you know, I feel that that's that that's the case.
2436000	2448000	But yeah, in terms of the assumptions of game theory, like, you know, game theory is kind of like one big component in in crypto economics.
2449000	2471000	But there is like something that I've been trying to think through and struggle with a little bit is this question of like exactly as Martin was saying, like whether, you know, there is an element of the kind of core engineering where, you know, modeling, you know, being so focused on modeling attacks makes sense because you want the kind of core engineering to be secure fundamentally.
2471000	2481000	When it becomes problematic is when that becomes a kind of like model and a lens for understanding all social relationships and and kind of expanding from there, a kind of worldview and a political view.
2481000	2486000	And that happens for some reason or another very quickly in the blockchain space.
2487000	2489000	When I was writing my PhD, I was running through it.
2489000	2508000	I did a little kind of experiment where I was trying to kind of work through the concept of trustlessness, which is like a major kind of like concept in the blockchain space and in crypto, crypto economics, you know, and trustlessness kind of defines a kind of threshold of trust that is required in order for the system to function securely.
2508000	2520000	So there's a famous kind of 51% attack and all these kinds of things where, you know, how many nodes in the network would need to collude in order for the network to then become, you know, biased or owned or whatever else.
2520000	2533000	And what I wanted to understand was like the way that trust and trustlessness was kind of conceptualized and worked with in a very rigorous way amongst computer engineers.
2533000	2543000	And yet for anyone actually engaging with blockchain systems and crypto economic systems and so on, a lot of trust is required, right?
2543000	2550000	Like you need to kind of like trust what you've read on a website, you need to trust, you know, the exchange rates on a kind of crypto exchange and so on and so forth.
2550000	2558000	Like you're never as an individual able to run go through, you know, all the GitHub code repositories in order to make sure that everything is super secure.
2558000	2562000	Like you actually need to trust a lot of people to engage with these systems.
2562000	2574000	So where is it that that kind of like mythical trustlessness that blockchain provides and the actual social reality where a lot of trust is required, where does that meet and how is that articulated?
2574000	2584000	And that's exactly the kind of like areas where, you know, then you do start to see a lot of scams and you do see start to see a lot of kind of security breaches and so on.
2585000	2587000	But it's it's a kind of it.
2587000	2612000	I think it's also one of the reasons why the kind of security protocol so quickly becomes a political and social imagination, because you're trying to produce, you know, the effort of the security engineers to try to produce something that is, you know, stable as a kind of political, social, legal and economic system through cryptography and through math, right?
2612000	2633000	And so, you know, the more that you see that it doesn't play out that way in reality, the more you need to bring reality into into those kind of conditions of trustlessness, the more you need to kind of like add more things on some blockchain, you know, like put it out into IOT and, you know, get more because everything outside of the trustless network is just is, you know, dodgy potentially, right?
2633000	2634000	Sorry, a little rant.
2634000	2652000	I think also from a broader perspective, this point of trust is super interesting to me, because maybe that's even the key behind the whole blockchain thing is it tries to replace a social mechanism of trust that has a long history with a technological mechanism, which makes sense in a way.
2653000	2667000	trust that has a long history with a technological mechanism, which which makes sense in a way, but trust in social relations, like I learned that from Nicholas Luman, I think is a is a mechanism to reduce complexity.
2667000	2679000	And once you remove that social mechanism, you set free a lot of potential complexity to deal with on a technological level, because you can abstract all that away.
2679000	2684000	If you just trust the person, you know, I have right now I have a babysitter at home.
2684000	2690000	I trust her to bring my kid to sleep at around now, probably seven or seven thirty.
2690000	2693000	I could also set up a smart contract with her.
2693000	2698000	You know, if the baby monitor says you're not down at seven thirty, you're not getting paid.
2698000	2700000	But is that really better?
2700000	2705000	And or does it just so much possible complexity emerges out of this?
2705000	2710000	Because maybe she has a good reason not to put it down at seven thirty, but maybe at seven forty.
2710000	2712000	And then the smart contract would not work.
2712000	2714000	And then we have to fix it afterwards.
2715000	2719000	And so much complexity that I can just abstract away by just trusting that person.
2719000	2721000	She's a good person. She will do a good job.
2721000	2724000	And lots of social relationships work this way by trust.
2724000	2728000	And we have to be very careful which ones we want to replace and which ones we want to keep.
2728000	2732000	I think that works perfectly fine in the babysitter use case.
2732000	2744000	But in the use case where you want to build something global platform or kind of potentially something with millions of people involved,
2744000	2757000	I think it simply doesn't work that there are those personal trust relationships that make the whole thing work together.
2757000	2760000	Or at least there will come clear limitations.
2760000	2771000	And just a very practical example where I very much value this trustlessness is in Ethereum.
2771000	2782000	There are all those different projects that build pieces, kind of Lego pieces that you can then build more complex applications together.
2782000	2792000	And it very much makes for us a difference whether one piece has something like an operator and kind of someone who could change the rules
2792000	2800000	and where we would need to trust them and kind of need to make sure that they will not change it in a way we don't like it.
2800000	2807000	And then kind of the whole thing we are building has a problem because one piece here is now acting in a different way.
2807000	2816000	Or a piece with no operator, with no way to change it, what we would call trustless.
2816000	2829000	And if you have those trustless puzzle pieces, the hope is that it allows you to build much more robust and complex systems.
2830000	2837000	Many times I find myself actually really very much agreeing with the definition of the problem.
2837000	2844000	You know, also when I read Glenn Whale and Vitalik Buterin some text about the radical markets,
2844000	2848000	I really, really, really, really do not agree with the solutions that they provide.
2848000	2856000	But when they come to define the problems, they're actually quite clear on how to describe the ways in which
2856000	2866000	contemporary structures, political structures are actually not, oftentimes not, any more convincing
2866000	2876000	in the way they address the overall changing, I don't know, landscape of things, to be very unprecise.
2876000	2883000	So there is this open question on how can we do things differently.
2883000	2888000	There are many interesting problems that are being talked about in this space.
2888000	2894000	And one of the questions would be in which case is the way that they are being approached from the
2894000	2900000	cryptoeconomics perspective, for example, is adequate and in which case it is not.
2904000	2906000	Yeah, go ahead.
2906000	2910000	Well, I don't want to, if you're going to kind of override the topic or something.
2910000	2914000	I was trying to think what I would say next, so please go ahead.
2914000	2920000	No, just to say that, I don't know, for me, my work and interests is kind of like,
2920000	2928000	I'm not so intensely focused on whether cryptoeconomics and blockchain are the solutions to things,
2928000	2933000	but I do think that they have done a lot to put the right questions on the table, right?
2933000	2940000	And to open up a lot more possibility for experimentation and especially in two areas,
2940000	2945000	especially when it comes to currencies and currency design and questions of value and money,
2945000	2953000	at all scales, really, both in terms of global money, all the way down to local and this kind of thing,
2953000	2956000	and questions of privacy.
2956000	2963000	And I think, you know, questions of privacy is something that unfortunately is like,
2963000	2970000	is kind of, to me, it seems like it's seeped a little bit into the background in recent kind of blockchain world.
2970000	2975000	You know, like, okay, it turns out Bitcoin isn't anonymous.
2975000	2980000	Okay, fine, you know, anonymity and privacy are slightly different things.
2980000	2989000	But I think privacy is super interesting and super important in a kind of like increasingly digitally mediated world,
2989000	2992000	also in terms of questions of governance in the state, right?
2992000	2996000	So, you know, we no longer have like James Scott seeing like a state.
2996000	3000000	There's no longer a kind of, it's not exactly a panopticon that we're living in anymore, is it?
3000000	3006000	It's a kind of different scenario, a kind of like algorithmic visibility that's a lot more nebulous,
3006000	3013000	a lot more contingent, a lot harder to kind of like point your finger exactly at where the power is.
3013000	3021000	And I think like the questions of kind of privacy within that and the kind of added building blocks
3021000	3026000	that blockchain technology promises in terms of currency design, governance structures and so on,
3026000	3032000	there are interesting ways then to kind of recreate, you know, how you want to organize as a community
3032000	3035000	in different levels and in different kind of scales.
3035000	3038000	And I don't see this as like in any way a kind of absolute thing.
3038000	3046000	It's not like replacing the state with something else because we actually live in a super complex patchwork of sovereignty already.
3046000	3056000	I was reading a really interesting paper earlier today on water governance and indigenous sovereignty in the states versus the kind of federal.
3056000	3059000	And there's a kind of coexistence, right?
3059000	3071000	And that coexistence is not just like, you know, Native Americans are doing the same thing as kind of federal government.
3071000	3075000	It's like they're doing things very, very differently, but they're governing water.
3075000	3084000	Do you know what I mean? So it's like these qualitatively, like qualitatively different ways of doing things and the ability to determine that.
3084000	3091000	Yeah, just like one note on the privacy question, blockchain really brings both ends of the spectrum.
3091000	3092000	Yeah, exactly.
3092000	3098000	It brings the full kind of everything is verifiable, everything is visible, every transaction is.
3098000	3104000	But it also has a spectrum and to me still totally unclear kind of where we will end.
3104000	3111000	It also brings the other spectrum and that's more recent developments with zero knowledge proofs,
3111000	3122000	or whatever technology that really allows you or plausibly could allow you a total anonymity and and and no.
3122000	3127000	And like you could do things, text evasion would be super easy.
3127000	3138000	You could you could do you could also have pay or incentivize specific behavior and no one would kind of.
3139000	3145000	There's quite a bit of scary things that are possible on that end of the spectrum.
3145000	3148000	I don't know where we will end.
3148000	3151000	Can I ask a blunt question to you as experts?
3151000	3156000	Because I think we can all agree that crypto is a challenge for state actors.
3156000	3158000	But is it a challenge for capitalism?
3159000	3164000	Would you think that the or is that maybe you as a practitioner also,
3164000	3171000	is that something you would like working towards like a post capitalist form of economy that should be based on a blockchain?
3171000	3179000	Or is it rather like this is just the next level of radical free market capitalism getting rid of all state actors and it's just money?
3179000	3183000	It's it's such a that is such an interesting question,
3183000	3187000	I mean, in the sense that I've had this question on my mind like for the longest time.
3187000	3192000	And it was one of my motivations to write my PhD also was trying to work that out.
3192000	3194000	And I still haven't worked it out. And I think there's something.
3194000	3196000	Yeah, I still have. I haven't worked it out.
3196000	3204000	You know, I have I have to admit, like in many ways, like there is a lot to be said for the way that, you know,
3204000	3212000	blockchain systems and Bitcoin and whatever kind of propagates a kind of like hyper capitalist mentality and approach to the world.
3212000	3217000	Like, absolutely, you know, you can see that. But is that the full story?
3217000	3220000	Like, no, no, to me, it's absolutely not the full story.
3220000	3226000	I think there's all kinds of weird mutations happening and even, you know, possible alternatives.
3226000	3231000	But, you know, if you if you want to go deep into whether post capitalism is possible through blockchain,
3231000	3237000	I mean, like that goes that requires like some real deep soul searching around the entire technology industry,
3237000	3246000	really, because the entire technology industry is deeply embedded and dependent on capitalist modes of organizing production and reproduction.
3246000	3256000	You know, but there is some I do find it because you mentioned radical markets and they call themselves post capitalist,
3257000	3262000	which I just find so interesting because it's like, you know, kind of that for many people,
3262000	3265000	the kind of market approach to the world is like quintessentially.
3265000	3276000	That's like that is, you know, one answer would be to maybe hyper capitalism is then post capitalism because I'm trying to find one thought.
3277000	3289000	So I would say, yeah, of course, markets are a big thing in blockchain, but also different forms of tokens or of value.
3289000	3294000	So I guess one critique of I mean, of course, we wouldn't first need to define capitalism,
3294000	3304000	but I guess one broad critique about capitalism and what people don't like about capitalism is kind of the reduction on one number kind of money.
3304000	3310000	But if we have multidimensional money, we just don't have like euros,
3310000	3316000	but kind of 100 different forms of tokens that represent different things or different different things.
3316000	3324000	We value different relationships and different people can, well, optimize for different different values.
3324000	3330000	Well, you could call that hyper capitalism because you kind of have market mechanism for even more things.
3330000	3340000	But maybe then it doesn't feel like capitalism anymore because it's not just a reduction on one number, but on 100 numbers or something like that.
3343000	3345000	I mean, there's so much to be said about that, right?
3345000	3356000	It's like, oh, that would open up actually a big topic, but maybe we will come there in the discussion with the audience.
3356000	3363000	I think one of the takeaways is that and that's something I learned from Benjamin's fantastic book,
3363000	3369000	which I can only recommend highly is that it's a political question.
3369000	3371000	Actually, I learned it from your dissertation as well.
3371000	3377000	So it does indeed open up new realms of possibilities, I guess.
3377000	3383000	But it's very important that we ask ourselves which of those we want to choose.
3386000	3388000	Mm hmm.
