0	5400	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome
5400	8460	Silvia Federici in today's episode.
8460	14560	She is a highly influential feminist scholar, teacher and activist known for her groundbreaking
14560	20480	work on the intersections of capitalism, patriarchy and reproductive labor.
20480	26820	I am very happy that this episode came together, since Silvia's work provides crucial insight
26820	32500	into the question of how the separation of spheres in which there is a sphere of production,
32500	38820	which is imagined as separate of a sphere of reproduction, how this imagined separation
38820	40860	might be overcome.
40860	47580	This podcast here has featured quite a few models of democratic economic planning, which,
47580	52860	I have to be honest, oftentimes struggle to treat this question adequately.
52900	57420	And it's great to have Silvia bring in her perspective on these topics.
57420	62840	And since we touch up on the topic of commoning and commons in the course of our conversation
62840	69060	as well, if you're interested in questions of how democratic coordination of commoning
69060	75180	on a scale, I wanted to point you towards the newly translated book by Stefan Merec
75180	80220	and Simon Sutterluty called Make Capitalism History.
80220	83980	You'll find the open access publication in the show notes.
83980	90780	And then another note, just like the episodes with Matt Huber and Elisa Longkorn anti-Leo,
90780	96140	this episode also came together because of a conference I was recently invited to take
96140	97140	part in.
97140	103100	The conference was titled The Great Transition, and I was invited to take part in a symposium
103100	105420	on democratic planning.
105420	110860	And I just wanted to take the chance to say thanks to everybody involved.
110860	118020	Before we start, I wanted to also thank Lukas, Wilfried, and Carl for their kind donations.
118020	122420	And now please enjoy today's episode with Silvia Federici.
127420	131820	Silvia, I'm thrilled and honored to have you on the show.
131820	132820	Welcome.
132820	133820	Yes.
134220	135220	Thank you so much.
135220	143180	And, you know, I would like this to be a conversation and you introduce me to the topic of today
143180	150900	and give me a little bit of the background of, you know, introduce your audience to the
150900	154460	issues and the topic that we're going to discuss today.
154460	155460	Yes, absolutely.
155460	162060	Well, I think we will start with a question that goes in the direction of your critique
162700	169540	towards the idea of progress, and then we'll kind of move along to topics of commons and
169540	172060	topics of democratic planning, maybe.
172060	174460	I'm very much interested in this topic.
174460	180500	And at the end, I will have some questions around the question whether or not we should
180500	187980	overcome the category of labor as such, because in some of the models for democratic planning,
187980	193340	for example, unfortunately, the category of labor is not overcome and there are still
193340	197380	some forms of connection between work and pay.
197380	201820	And I'm quite critical of this approach, so I would be interested in what you think about
201820	202820	it.
202820	207820	But we will start with a question on progress, if that's all right with you.
208180	218180	Of course, you know, but there is a broad literature to which, you know, I refer, actually,
218180	228060	that has criticized, you know, progress as enlightenment, bourgeois conception, you know,
228060	230740	that it's very evolutionary.
230740	240220	It's a very evolutionary conception, but has been used to actually justify, you know, capitalist
240220	251500	development, yes, justify and in a sense, you know, erase, erase the cost of it, erase,
251500	260660	you know, all the atrocities that capitalist development has left and in its wake.
260660	267660	So and, you know, sponsored in order to realize.
267660	271020	So progress, it's a great lie.
271020	276900	Progress is the great lie, you know, of capitalist ideology.
276900	279900	And in fact, we can really measure.
279900	281900	How do we measure progress?
281900	285340	I think this is a very fundamental question.
285340	286820	How do we measure progress?
286820	288060	What are the value?
288220	297220	What are the core value that enable us to decide whether a society is progressing or not?
297220	304580	And within capitalist ideology, you know, progress is measured in terms of technological
304580	311180	development, so that today, for example, we can communicate Vienna and New York.
311180	313380	We can communicate this is progress.
313380	318260	Obviously, people could not do it in the Middle Ages.
318260	325980	But when we look, for example, today in terms of true exchange of knowledge, can we really
325980	334260	say that the technology has allowed human being as a whole, you know, the human community
334260	341820	to really exchange, grow in terms of its understanding of each other?
341820	343780	No, obviously not.
343780	349300	You know, we have a situation of permanent wealth here now in most parts of the world.
349300	356020	If we did have real progress, we wouldn't have two centuries of capitalist development
356020	361020	that have destroyed the life of millions and millions and millions of people.
361020	369300	No, so that when technological development is, in fact, as in fact, being primarily put
369300	376140	at the service, you know, of capitalist accumulation of individual private wealth and
376140	382900	military destruction, World War One, millions of people killed, World War Two, the threat
382900	390620	of nuclear warfare, we are now speaking of a society in which even life, even human life
390620	398100	is such because of the technology, because of the very so-called technological development
398180	405540	that is associated with the notion of progress, then we can see that we have to really
406260	414020	reconceptualize what is valuable, you know, what is that we should struggle for, what kind of
414020	423620	society we want to construct. So let's leave behind as totally tainted the notion of progress
423620	432580	and instead seeing that this development that is associated with progress, you know,
432580	438100	as in fact brought more and more misery, more and more impoverishment. Today there are millions
438100	443140	and millions of people who are totally impoverished, who have been expelled from their lands,
443140	450900	whose cultures have been destroyed, thousands of languages, species, you know, natural species,
450900	456820	and also human community have been completely destroyed. Entire cultural world is like,
456820	462740	what progress is that? What is the measurement we use? So this is my response to progress.
463300	470340	There is this strand within like orthodox Marxism, which likes to argue that first there
470340	476580	has to be capitalism that would sufficiently develop the forces of production and only then
476660	483140	on the basis of that, like real communism would be possible. And of course, you refuse this notion,
483140	490900	but I'm asking myself, what does this mean for alternatives to capitalism then for
490900	497380	this idea of transition as well? Because I have to think, for example, about the recent work of
497380	503220	Kohai Saito. I don't know if you're familiar with his work. He's developing this idea of degrowth
503780	511860	communism, which is kind of arguing in a similar direction that progress in the capitalist sense
511860	516820	is not necessary to develop communism. I would be interested in your opinion
516820	524740	on what does this mean to reject this specific idea of progress for the question of alternatives
524740	532180	to capitalism. Absolutely. So the question of, I think, Marx's idea, and you know,
532900	540420	it would be very interesting. I think that probably Marx lived at the historical
540420	547140	and political conjunction. This is the sense I can make of it, that he lived at historical
547140	560740	political conjunction, where the possibility of a broad social change, of a crisis of capitalism,
560740	569700	of the end of capitalism, seemed to be near, seemed to be soon possible. Therefore,
570340	576500	you know, this image, you know, of the worker who takes over the capitalist machine
577220	586500	and now redirects it, you know, once, you know, redirects it to a different goal, redirects it,
586500	593460	you know, to the benefit of humanity, to an egalitarian, the purposes of an egalitarian
593460	603380	society, etc., etc. So I think this is how I can justify Marx's idea that in a way, capitalism,
603380	610500	obviously, you know, capitalism, a necessary stage, well, necessary because it was an inevitable
610500	616740	stage from the point of view, you know, obviously of the power relation in Europe, but that it would
616740	625860	be necessary, you know, for constructing the condition, you know, of a communist society,
625860	634420	you know. As I said, Marx must have come to this conclusion only because he believed the revolution
634420	643700	was imminent. Otherwise, he would have had to consider what is the cost, you know, of a process
643700	650260	of large scale industrialization across the world, even from the point of view,
650900	660500	right, of, you know, what it costs to industrialize the globe in terms of its impact of nature.
661140	669540	But that's only one consideration. What he did not consider is the capitalist development
670180	678100	destroys the very condition for a communist society, creates technological conditions,
678100	684020	but destroys other conditions, destroy, for example, changes, people's subjectivities,
684900	695700	you know, destroys common solidarity, destroys commonality, and, you know, so whereas
696500	705140	it creates, you know, new technological means, new technological means, at the same time there's
705140	712740	a process of destruction, of destruction of human relations, you know, that makes the advantage of
712740	720180	a new technology, the advantage of a new technology, right, you know, limits tremendously what the
720180	729220	advantage, and there's a third consideration, which is, is it really technological underdevelopment
729940	736980	that was the cause in the Middle Ages or other society, you know, of people's misery, of people's
736980	744340	hunger, of communities inability to reproduce themselves, or it was the social relation,
745060	750980	the fact that in the Middle Ages you had a feudal old, a feudal world that was built on the
750980	758580	exploitation of people, where those who made decision was a military class, right, so the idea
759140	768100	that in a way capitalism was necessary because it provided the means to, you know, overcome hunger,
768100	774740	overcome poverty, overcome scarcity, no, technology was never the problem of scarcity,
775540	782020	technology, the lack of technology, and we know, for example, that there were other roads to
782020	788420	technological development, for example in China, China had reached a quite high level of technological
788420	795060	development by the 16th century, there were other roads to technology, other than the capitalist one,
795620	801300	that the fact that the capitalist road to technological development, you know, was built
801300	808900	on the exploitation of labor, on the destruction of community, on violence, all this also
810100	816580	undermined, you know, the advantages, and moreover, what, what technology was invented,
816580	820580	capitalism invented a technology that was instrumental to exploitation,
821460	828820	it's not the technology, technology is not a general term, technology is not a universal,
828820	836340	you know, road or a form of wealth, you know, what kind of technology capitalism has developed,
836340	841620	other type of technology, the technology capitalism has developed has always been a
841620	850820	political technology, a technology that served to defeat, right, to contrast, you know, work as
850820	857140	solidarity, work as capacity to resist, work as capacity to struggle, so it is the technology
857140	863540	that has always had built within it a political problem, capitalist technology has always built
863540	871380	within itself elements that made it impossible to take over by a communist, a real communist
871380	877700	society, for instance, disregard for nature, a technology that has disregard for nature is not
877700	882980	a technology we can use, it's not a technology that should be generalized across the world,
882980	890500	a technology that is built within itself, you know, a program that is antagonistic to work as
890500	896100	solidarity, antagonistic, so yes, capitalism brings workers together, but how it brings workers
896100	904100	together, not in a way that enhances their solidarity, so I think that Marx was wrong
904660	911620	in terms of this idea that of the transfer of technology, right, okay, so the revolution
911620	916420	and then we take over the machine and we put the machine to good use, well that machine could not
916420	923380	be put because it had built-in problems, other machines have to be used, no, and secondly,
923380	930180	it did not see the kind of devastation, you know, and now it's all too obvious,
930820	939460	now it's all too obvious. One last thing, I don't particularly, of course, I'm against the idea of
939460	944420	capitalist growth because capitalist world growth is capitalist development, it's capitalism,
945060	952500	right, but I don't think that growth is the enemy, the enemy is capitalism, growth is a
952500	961060	subcategory, it's a subcategory, it's one of the pieces, right, it's one of the strategies
961060	968820	that capitalism uses to reproduce itself, no, but it's not growth, the enemy is capitalism,
968820	974340	the enemy is the exploitation of nature and humanity, this is the fundamental and in this,
974340	983620	in a way, I agree with Marx, you know, that I think that the powerful expert and still alive
983620	992660	and still fundamental expert of Marx's work, you know, is having focus and identify capitalism
992660	1000180	as a system that is built, you know, on the accumulation of people's labor, on the exploitation,
1000180	1008900	on expropriation, dispossession, right, on therefore these forms of, you know, alienation,
1008900	1014260	enslavement, et cetera, et cetera, and constant immiseration because once you take away from people
1014260	1021300	the means of their reproduction, then there is no limit to how much you can immiserate their life,
1021300	1026420	and we see now where we live in a world of permanent welfare, permanent dispossession,
1026420	1033460	millions and millions thrown, you know, into refugee camps, you know, entire areas,
1033460	1042020	you know, of the world destroyed by climatic change. So, yes, we really need to rethink
1042020	1046020	this idea about the necessity of capitalism, God forbid.
1047780	1054740	Yeah, and I would really like to explore a bit the question of alternatives because
1055460	1063780	if we do not go along the road of ideas of, let's say, socialist modernity, so to speak,
1063780	1069140	what is the alternative that you would like to come about? I mean, you already pointed towards
1069140	1074500	we, of course, need alternative social relations. We might also need alternative technologies,
1074500	1080100	you pointed out. I mean, you are quite famous for your engagement with this idea of commoning.
1080100	1086020	It's an important part of your research. I'm quite sure that commoning would have to be an
1086020	1092500	element of the alternative as well, but there are many examples where commoning works quite well
1092500	1099540	within communal structures up to a certain size, I would say. Community-supported agriculture would
1099540	1106420	be one example, and there are many, many more, and there are also examples for commoning on a global
1106420	1113700	scale in the realm of digital commons, which are easily reproducible and, let's say, nonrivalous.
1115140	1125860	There are less examples for global commons that are rival resources, so to speak. I would be
1125860	1132180	interested in how you think about what might collective forms of organization look like
1132180	1139860	at a level of society as a whole that are organized along this principle of commoning.
1139860	1150740	Yeah, so first of all, what commons will be like is almost very difficult, and I don't think it is
1150740	1161380	useful to actually have a map, a theoretical political map now, because even our own imagination
1161380	1169300	is very much conditioned by what we have, but the situation that we are living. So the definition
1169300	1174900	of what kind of a communal society will be, you know, is something that is a process,
1175540	1181620	and it's something that can be defined only in a process of struggle, and in a process of struggle,
1181620	1188580	and the coming together of different struggles across the globe, because there's not one model,
1188580	1194820	as Massimo de Angelis has written over and over and very eloquently, the idea
1195380	1202260	that, you know, in this great globe, Asia, Africa, with different history, different climatic
1202260	1210180	situations, different trajectories, that there could be a model of commons, that this is
1210980	1218740	unthinkable. Like the Separatists say, many yeses, one no, no to the exploitation,
1218740	1224980	no to capitalism, and then many yeses, many roads, different roads, you know,
1226900	1232340	shaped by the historic trajectories, the historic struggles that people have made,
1232340	1239860	right? So this is very, very important, and I think, first of all, no to global commons.
1239860	1244900	There's no such a thing as global commons. Who's going to be the agent to make decisions
1244900	1249220	on a global level? We don't have a global subject. Now we have the UN, and we know what the
1249220	1256180	disaster the United Nations has been. So if we're talking about, and here we are already entering
1256180	1262820	the discussion of what is democracy. Democracy is the rule of the people. So how do people rule,
1262820	1268340	you know, who is the global subject, right? The idea of a global superstructure, this is what
1268340	1274420	capitalism has, has created, and we know what the global superstructure is. Capitalism is the
1274420	1281860	United Nations, which is really the, you know, institutional face of capital, international
1281860	1290340	capital. So no to that global idea of a global commons. I want to quote here, over and over,
1290340	1295620	Maria Mies, who just died, you know, a great feminist, one of the most lucid, powerful
1296340	1304340	anti-capitalist voices within the feminist movement. And she was very adamant about rejecting
1304340	1312340	the idea of the global commons, right? And so, you know, what we are talking about, you know,
1312340	1323300	is instead replanting, you know, rerouting, you know, decision making, the construction of
1323300	1331460	community, you know, and the construction of commons, right, on localities, which doesn't mean
1331460	1338580	that they are fragmented, isolated, and unconnected. Absolutely not. And here I,
1338580	1347060	you know, I want to make reference, for instance, to what, you know, what we call Latin American was,
1347060	1354980	you know, before the conquest, before colonization, you know, when you had, you know, a vast world
1354980	1362900	all throughout, you know, from the south of the continent to the north, of local economies,
1363540	1370020	local society, and yet with a tremendous amount of exchange, with a tremendous amount of
1370020	1377700	interconnection, right? So it's not true that to think of local commons is to think,
1377700	1385620	you know, of isolation, of going back to the Stone Age. Not at all. Not at all. It means that
1385620	1392340	to have, for example, for instance, of confederacies of commons, you know, and of
1392340	1399540	course today we also, some of the technologies, some of the means that are in existence can also
1399540	1407380	be used, can also be used, but with great discrimination, with great discrimination.
1408260	1416180	And about digital commons. Well, digital commons, right? I'm always a bit hesitant
1416180	1423460	and skeptical, you know, before embracing them, because when I think of digital today,
1423460	1429220	I immediately think, you know, massacres in the Congo. This is what I immediately think.
1429220	1434500	Not only the Congo, but I'm thinking of lithium. I think, where's the lithium coming from?
1434980	1439300	Where's the coltan? Where's the real earth? Where are all the minerals?
1439300	1445140	And so far, you know, those minerals have been the disaster, have been the cause of wars,
1445140	1450500	have been the cause of massacres, have been the cause of recolonization of entire areas of the
1450500	1458580	world. So unless we find, you know, unless the question of not only what can be done with the
1458580	1465700	digital, but how the digital is produced, unless the question becomes central to the discussion on
1465700	1472740	digital commons, then I have to say, no, this cannot be the solution, because we have to
1473300	1481220	realize that behind much of the warfare and much of the predatory practices, the incredibly
1481220	1487620	predatory practices of international capital today, especially in Africa, Latin America,
1487620	1494980	there is exactly, you know, the need to feed this new technology, right? And unfortunately also,
1494980	1500260	you know, the new green technology, the one that is supposed to, you know, save the earth,
1500260	1506100	right? Which now depends on the production of billions of batteries, you know, for electrical
1506100	1512420	cars. Where are those batteries going to go? In which ocean? In which fields? Who is going to be
1512420	1517540	the beneficiary of all that poison that is going to leak out of those batteries?
1518580	1525220	So I think we have to be careful with the digital commons. And I think we need instead to see what
1525220	1531860	gives power back to community, back to the people who are knowledgeable about the condition of the
1531860	1537860	earth, of the soil, and the condition of the social relation of the places in which they live.
1537940	1545140	I mean, it's also the construction of humanity. You know, we are becoming, and now we're AI,
1545140	1551540	and you know, we are becoming zombies. We are really, you know, artificial intelligence is a
1551540	1559060	big problem. The problem is also the mechanization of human beings. The mechanization of human beings.
1559060	1569780	I'm really flabbergasted about how much, you know, population that seem to have all this power,
1569780	1579860	the computer, the little phone, and so on, you know, are in fact unable to really impact
1579860	1588340	in a significant way the politics, you know, of international capital. And at times,
1588340	1597460	I even think that precisely access to these gadgets, you know, have in a sense put back the
1597460	1606420	struggle, dozens and dozens of years. In other words, the capitalism, you know, with the computer,
1606420	1614420	with the iPhone, the iPad, and all of that, you know, as pacified, as succeeded in pacifying,
1614420	1623780	and giving people assimilated of a power that in fact we don't have. Yes, we can call this,
1623780	1630820	yes, we can call that, but actually decisions are being made that are extraordinary, extraordinary.
1630820	1636100	We have people in the streets in New York. We have people dying in the streets in New York.
1636100	1642820	We have the largest incarceration, the larger number of people incarcerated. This society,
1642820	1649940	which is, you know, the leading capitalist society, presumably in prosperity, you know,
1649940	1655780	is a society where people are dying in the street, where we have the life, where people have been
1655780	1664980	executed with summary processes, you know, not to mention, not to mention, you know, the 800 jails
1664980	1670100	that the US is running across the world, the military intervention in much of the world,
1670100	1677460	and we are not able to stop it. And so I've been wondering how much this technology,
1677460	1685780	which has been thrown at us and made more available, has also given this pseudo-empowerment,
1686500	1689940	pseudo-empowerment, and I'm not saying that there are not advantages to it,
1690580	1698340	right, but certainly we are very unaware on a day-to-day basis of the cost of this technology.
1698340	1703860	We don't know whose fields have been expropriated in order to create the iPhone,
1704420	1710180	right, that we use on a day or the computer that we use. We are totally unaware of that.
1710180	1717380	So the distancing also, the capitalism has produced the distances of the places where
1717380	1721620	things are extracted, where things are produced, and where things are consumed.
1722180	1729060	That distances that makes us irresponsible, responsible and irresponsible, right? It's
1729060	1735700	really a serious problem. So we need actually to bring together production and consumption
1735700	1744340	so that we know, that we know if the oranges we eat, if the clothes that we wear have caused
1744340	1753460	somebody's blood, have caused somebody's life, have caused somebody's loss of land and forced
1753460	1762660	migration. Yeah. Let's maybe dig a little deeper into that because this idea of bringing together
1762660	1770180	production and reproduction, or maybe in other terms transcend this idea of separation of spheres,
1770180	1776020	this is really important, I think, as you already pointed towards right now. I would
1776020	1783380	be interested in what this might look like in connection to this question of organization,
1783380	1790420	because you refused this idea of a global commons that would have a form of meta-organization,
1790420	1796820	so to speak, but you also pointed out that there will be quite a lot of coordination going on
1796820	1802500	between the different commons. So maybe we can cross these two. Then the question would be,
1803140	1811380	what would a form of organizing a mode of reproduction, so to speak, what would that
1811380	1818900	look like when these separations of spheres of production on the one side and reproduction
1818980	1827860	on the other is overcome? So how to organize a, let's say, mode of reproduction between these
1827860	1835540	different commons and projects and whatever entities there might be to coordinate with?
1836820	1843300	Yeah. This, of course, again, that cannot be a universal model. I mean, I imagine if you are
1843300	1849060	living in Eskimo land or if you're living in Mozambique, there are very different
1849060	1855220	possibilities, right? I'm thinking, for instance, in pre-Columbian America, the example of Peru,
1855220	1862820	you know Peru is a very elongated territory, and that elongated territory made for very different
1862820	1872020	types of cultivation, very different types of cultivation. So Peru, before the conquest,
1872580	1882020	was very alive, was an intricate system of exchanges that enabled people within a limited
1882020	1889700	territory after all, you know, to in fact benefit, you know, from production coming from different
1889700	1896740	areas, from different types of production. And, you know, of course, now we are in another world,
1896740	1904580	but this is something that now we can think of, right? In other words, when I was speaking of,
1904580	1913380	you know, the Confederacy of Commons, you know, I think that this also has implications on the
1913380	1921300	condition of production, which means that exchanges, yes, but not exchanges, you know,
1921300	1926820	you go to a supermarket today and, you know, perhaps the fish in the United States, you know,
1926820	1933860	may be coming from Africa or may be coming from across the world. And it's different if the fish
1933860	1942900	may come from Long Island or from areas. And so where, in fact, the possibility of the economic
1942900	1951060	exchange, right, is not only an ecological disaster as it is today, all these boxes,
1951620	1956980	all these boats, all these that are really destroying the planet,
1958180	1965940	but also allows for the circulation of human relations, so that you know the people from
1966020	1974100	which the food is coming. They are actually human social, cultural interchanges. This is a kind of
1974100	1980260	world that we want to reconstruct. And today we have in a very atomic form, you know, with the
1980260	1988020	community-supported agriculture, for instance, as a little, as a microcosm, right? But when you look
1988020	1994740	and analyze it and you expand it, as if on a computer, and you expand it, then you see that
1994740	2000980	what is being exchanged, you know, is not only the food, what is being brought to the city from
2000980	2007620	the farms and so on. It's not only the food, but there is also a whole set of relations, right?
2007620	2013060	People are getting to know, yeah, who are the producers. You begin to develop a relationship
2013060	2020420	of trust, right? You begin to understand more about what is actually being produced, you know?
2020420	2027060	What are the vegetables of this season? You don't have these, you know, plastic enveloped,
2027060	2035620	you know, universal, ever-present, you know, ever-available, you know, food production,
2035620	2041540	no? But you actually begin to understand. So there is a richness that we have lost.
2042100	2048020	There is a richness of, and I think of that way, I think of the way of expanding scale,
2048020	2053940	you know, every different modalities, obviously, depending on, you know, communities on the
2053940	2061380	mountains, communities on the sea, you know, but something along those lines, you know, it's,
2061380	2072100	I think, and I come back to my original point that much of this is also something that we learn
2072740	2079060	in the process of the struggle, which is, has to be a process of construction,
2079700	2086500	not just resistance, but construction, experimentation. The struggle is a moment
2086500	2093060	not only to say no, but to experiment with alternative. From the beginning, there is no
2093060	2098580	real struggle unless it is accompanied by an immediate transformation of relation among the
2098580	2103780	people who are doing the struggle. Unless the struggle immediately constructs something new.
2103780	2108260	It's not just a no, but it's a yes to a different kind of social relations.
2110740	2112500	Maybe we can carve out...
2113780	2118820	I say the commons are a condition of the struggle, are a condition of the social
2118820	2124020	transformation. They are not just the goal, the objective of the social transformation.
2124020	2126900	They are the conditions. They are the ones that make it possible.
2128660	2136500	Yeah, and I mean, I think even though you kind of are a bit hesitant to reach too far ahead in
2136500	2142420	order not to prescribe some form of model or something like that, I still think that there are
2143140	2152820	some, let's say, maybe basic coordinates that can be distilled from this type of approach. So,
2153380	2158820	one you just pointed towards, it's not just about resistance, but also about construction.
2158820	2163140	Maybe one might say creative construction, experimental construction.
2165860	2171140	I think there are some basic coordinates that one might distill from this approach.
2171140	2178900	For example, as I pointed towards earlier, this question of labor and whether or not in alternative
2178900	2185940	modes of, in this case, modes of reproduction, one would want to reproduce this category of
2185940	2192340	labor or not. Because within the models of democratic economic planning that I engage with,
2192340	2199620	oftentimes these socialist models of democratic planning that I know, they usually tend to
2199620	2207220	reproduce and maintain this category of labor along with a form of remuneration that is paid
2207220	2213540	in exchange for work. So, this remuneration is, of course, not a classical wage relation then,
2213540	2219940	because it doesn't involve a surplus that is going to a capitalist. But still, the category of labor
2219940	2227780	as such and this exchange relation in the form of work for pay tends to be reproduced. I would be
2227780	2233860	interested in how you think about this, because within these models, at least, the rationale,
2233860	2240180	the argument of the people developing these models is kind of along this traditional idea of
2240180	2246340	two-phase model developed by Marx in the Goethe Program, where the idea is that you would have to
2246340	2254660	have a first phase where this connection between work and pay is still in place. And then afterwards,
2254660	2262340	you would have the ability to come to a second phase. But this all rests on this idea of progress
2262340	2269940	that you, of course, reject. So, I assume you would reject this two-phase model as well and the idea
2269940	2277620	of continuation of labor as a category as such as well. Am I right in assuming that?
2279780	2281300	So, it's a long story. Too much.
2282580	2288900	A lot of things. No, I disagree. The idea of the two-phase is not the idea of progress.
2289860	2301060	I just, the idea of progress is the ideas of this almost natural development that is attributed
2302500	2310580	to social. It's a way of naturalizing social relation and particularly capitalist relation,
2310580	2316500	right? Inevitably. So, the old is bad and we're going towards the new and the new, of course,
2316500	2323140	and also the connection with technology. No, labor. First of all, the distinction,
2323140	2330100	I think also in Marx, labor and work, right? The idea of labor implies exploitation. Labor implies
2330100	2336340	exploitation. So, I think there's a difference between labor and activity, right? Activity,
2336340	2343700	creative activity, self-determined or collectively self-determined. Not individually, but activity
2343700	2349780	that is very different from labor which is done under somebody else's, you know, decision-making,
2349780	2357460	et cetera, right? So, I think in terms of the transition and the question of money,
2358180	2364820	you know, I think in terms of a transition and I faced this issue so many times because there was
2364820	2370740	a time in my life I was involved in a feminist international organization called Wages for
2370740	2379380	Housework and we were accused of institutionalizing women in the home. We were accused of
2379380	2386900	confirming capitalism, monetizing the only sphere of life in which, you know, love, et cetera, et
2386900	2393380	cetera. And I famously, you know, thought that, you know, famously because that has been the most
2393380	2399380	popular things I've said in my life. Yeah, you know, they call it love. We call it unpaid labor.
2400740	2409460	And I still stay behind it. I still subscribe to it. So, the question of money. The question of
2409460	2421940	money is two points I want to make. Number one, struggle for monetary compensation. It's inevitable
2422900	2432500	until we can change the power relation between workers and capital because as long as we do not
2432500	2440900	re-appropriate the material condition of our reproduction, then we need to use money. Otherwise,
2440900	2448580	we die. The Zapatistas who have been, you know, the group of people, to my knowledge, who have
2448580	2458660	been most advanced in refusing monetary relation, they still use some money. They sell coffee for
2458660	2467380	monetary compensation because they have not been able yet to create all the material condition
2467380	2474100	of reproduction that are necessary without some money. So, as long as we are in a society
2474820	2482900	where the capitalist class still monopolizes, you know, much of the material condition, the land,
2482900	2490260	the soil, the waters, the technology, et cetera, et cetera, money is both a way of guaranteeing
2490260	2499460	some reproduction and also sucking wealth away from the capitalists. Obviously, that struggle
2499460	2505060	is not the struggle that is going. It's a struggle that is necessary, but it's also a
2505060	2512340	struggle that has to be accompanied by many, many, many other, you know, struggles. It's not this,
2512340	2521460	the main road, you know, to revolution. But we cannot say, and I used to, my response to people
2521460	2526980	who were critical of wages for households was to say, well, very good. Give up your wage. You are
2526980	2534180	teaching a university. Give up your wage. Liberate yourself from this bondage to capitalism. Work
2534180	2540260	for free. Of course, nobody has done that. Of course, you've been conceivable, you know. So,
2540260	2546980	I found the hypocrisy, the double standard. You know, I found that, you know, once again, yes,
2547620	2554340	you know, women's work in the home is treated as something very different. And no matter how much
2554340	2562340	you show that is the foundation for every labor activity, that is work that is exploited by
2562340	2568740	capital, is work that produces accumulation, creates work, blah, blah, blah, blah, etc. And
2568740	2576180	that has put women in the condition of, you know, having to accept any wage once they went out of
2577060	2585060	home. So, I think the money, you know, there is a phase of struggle. And that phase of struggle,
2585700	2592500	the goal of it is to change the poverty relation and reappropriate. So, to me, the goal of our
2592500	2602180	struggling every, every moment, every place, every moment is reappropriate, you know, the wealth
2602660	2608580	that has been produced, the wealth that we are producing, you know, control, I mean, land,
2608580	2615060	the issue of land, millions of people, land, land, land, land means everything. Land means trees,
2615620	2623060	land means waters, you know, land means, you know, leaves, medical roots,
2623860	2631060	land has such, is such wealth that when you lose your wealth, land, you lose much more than
2632020	2638900	physical sustenance, you lose a culture, you lose knowledges, you lose a tremendous amount of
2638900	2647460	knowledge when you lose the land. So, that process, you know, and I think in terms of
2647460	2654500	a future society, you know, in terms of, I think of a society without money or with money,
2655460	2663540	but money, see, that's the issue. What is money? And I'm thinking, I'm now, this is the issue of
2663540	2668100	money is really matching my mind because I'm really interested in the relation between women
2668100	2676980	and money. You know, what has been historically women? Yeah. And, you know, I have this book in
2676980	2684580	mind, which is called Women, Money and the Devil, that, you know, begins with the pact on the devil
2684580	2691060	between the witch and, you know, the devil gives her money. And then of course she, she's desperate,
2691700	2698980	you know, and she's, you know, screaming to her misery, he comes, give us some money.
2699540	2706020	And eventually, of course, has become my servant, I'll solve your problem. It's a very marital deal,
2706100	2716260	totally marital. And then she copulates with him. But within a few days, the money has given her
2716260	2723700	turns into ashes. This has intrigued me. In many demonologies, you find that detail.
2724500	2731780	And this has intrigued me immensely. Why? Even once they made the pact, even when they sold their soul,
2732660	2740420	women could not keep the money. Even when they sold their soul, capitalism has instituted this
2740420	2748580	incredible incompatibility between women and money. But aside from this, money has existed. I
2748580	2756260	visited many years ago with my partner, we visited the first place in Turkey. And right now I don't
2756260	2762980	have the, I don't remember the name. Yeah, but it's a famous place, but 3000 years ago,
2763540	2771380	the first coins were minted. 3000 years ago. But money had a very different function
2771940	2781140	than capitalist money. Money had ceremonial function, money sometimes served, so you didn't
2781140	2789780	want to bring, to move cattle, et cetera, et cetera. So you'd use the money as a substitute
2789780	2798340	for the transportation of goods. But money is different in capitalism and begins to function
2798340	2809300	capitalistically only when you have a society where people have been expropriated from the
2809300	2814740	capacity to reproduce themselves. At that moment, money function a different way,
2815700	2823460	right? At that moment, money is not just exchange. Money becomes an instrument of exploitation.
2823460	2829780	It becomes an instrument of, because then those people can be forced to work,
2830500	2836980	can be forced because their sustenance belongs to them. The moment that whatever allowed you to
2836980	2845300	survive is sucked away from you, then money becomes really the way that basically takes your
2845300	2851860	blood away, can take your blood and your life away. So I think it's very important. So when we say
2851860	2857300	there will be a future without money, maybe there will be money, but we will be functioning in a
2857300	2862900	very, very different way. Maybe it will be like maybe a token that you go to a movie theater
2862900	2869060	and you have a token that you show and with that token you enter the, you know,
2869060	2877460	you can enter, gives you the right to enter it. But I agree with Mark's view that the last,
2878260	2886980	you know, communism as from each according to their ability and to each according to their need
2887700	2895460	and decision made by the association of the community. That to me, it's a good model to look
2895460	2902500	at and what could be a money, but certainly not money. Money will not be able to function
2902500	2909700	because it will be a society in which the wealth, the material condition of reproduction
2910340	2913620	will be accessible to everybody in the community.
2916340	2924660	And that's the basis of democracy. A democracy without that access is nothing. It's a world as
2924660	2930340	it has become. Today the market, you know, the big democracy of the United States, we have people
2930340	2937940	sleeping in the street, you know, where you have, you know, pharmaceutical companies, you know, who
2937940	2945380	have killed the millions of people with this, you know, narcotic medicine and so on, you know,
2945380	2952580	can go scoff free by paying a few, a billion dollars and are not held to the same standard,
2952580	2960420	you know. So you can go to jail for 20 years, you know, for a little theft, but you have big companies
2960420	2964820	who are devastating the life of people. So that's not democracy.
2964820	2974180	I just wanted to maybe clear up a form of misunderstanding that might be in place,
2974180	2979460	because I just wanted to state that I'm absolutely with you that within a, like,
2979460	2986900	let's say early transition phase or within the immediate future, it's of course necessary to
2986900	2993860	fight for higher wages and not kind of dismiss money as something that we would not need in order
2993860	3000740	to live within the context that we live in right now. The thing is that within these models that
3000740	3007780	I study, these models for democratic economic planning, they argue that even though a situation
3007780	3015060	is already in place in which there is democratic control over the economy, that still then there
3015060	3022980	would need to be some form of connection between work and pay in place in order to, let's say,
3022980	3029780	discipline its subjects, at least for a certain period of time, because it is assumed that this
3029780	3037700	would still need to be necessary, actually at the end, for reasons of efficiency, so to speak,
3037700	3045860	you know. So in order to be able to reproduce a certain type of wealth in material terms,
3045860	3051300	it would still be necessary to, you know, have these mechanisms in place. And that's why I said
3051300	3057540	there is a connection between this idea of a two-phase model and this idea of progress,
3057540	3064900	because then the argument is essentially we do not yet have enough capacity when it comes to
3064900	3072260	the forces of production in order to have full communism. And until then, we would need to kind
3072260	3078340	of discipline our subjects in order to get to this place of fully developed forces of production.
3078340	3083140	And that's why I meant that there is a certain connection between the two ideas, you know.
3083140	3092820	I understand, but I'm very suspicious of the discipline. Who's going to do the discipline?
3092820	3102500	Who's going to be disciplined? So that to me, that plan, that democratic planning is not something
3102580	3110180	that I would, you know, sign up for, because when I hear discipline, all my, you know,
3111140	3120020	practice say run for the gun when you hear these words, because very dangerous. This sounds like
3120020	3126980	capitalism. You need to actually whip people to work, decide who's valuable, who's not valuable,
3127620	3137140	and reproduce, you know, the whole mark, as Mark should say, the hierarchies, the control system,
3137140	3141620	the two-tier society. That's exactly what we are fighting against.
3142660	3147300	Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I think the people developing these models, they would, of course,
3147300	3154100	argue that there is a base income for everybody. And on top of that, you would have these
3154100	3160980	remuneration schemes that would allow to, as I said, kind of discipline its subjects.
3161620	3168420	I think they wouldn't call it disciplining. In my eyes, it is still disciplining, and I'm against
3168420	3176260	this kind of approach, but I just have to be fair in terms of showcasing their arguments for that.
3176260	3181780	And there's another argument that maybe complicates the whole thing a bit more,
3181780	3187460	and this argument is actually coming from a feminist perspective, in which the argument
3187460	3196260	goes that within a totally voluntarist societal organization, there might be a danger of running
3196260	3205380	into a situation where, again, people who are most vulnerable are kind of having a worse situation
3206020	3211300	when trying to organize this reproduction of societies. In this feminist critique,
3211300	3217620	I think the argument would be that the transparency that comes along with forms of remuneration and a
3218580	3226020	general obligation to work is seen as a guard against a continuation of unjust relations
3226020	3231220	in the sphere of reproduction within post-capitalist configurations. So this would be,
3231220	3233620	I think, the argument. I don't see anything
3233620	3237940	voluntaristic in what I'm talking about. I'm not seeing anything. I'm seeing a transformation
3237940	3243460	of social relation that occurs in the process of the struggle. I mean, look, if we want to look,
3243460	3250180	for instance, at societies that are running now on a more communal system, right? I mean, yeah,
3252820	3258900	look, there is a Guatemalan-taken feminist who has written a very beautiful book,
3258900	3267060	Gladys Tsutsun, where she discusses what has been the history and the organization
3267060	3275540	of communal work, society, of Totonicapan, which is in the Highlands of Guatemala.
3276260	3281860	And she describes a situation where there is a culture, there is a collective agreement.
3281860	3287140	Collective agreement, because it's stipulated through assemblies, is the assembly. The assembly
3287140	3292580	is the whole. You make the decision, but you have to contribute to the reproduction of the society.
3293140	3299780	So you may call that disciplining, but the fact is that you cannot, if you don't actually,
3299780	3306260	there is a general agreement that in order to keep the society going, something, you know,
3306260	3311780	you have a little responsibility, you have to do something, you know? And even if you migrate,
3312340	3318340	even if you migrate, you have to have something. And even when you return as a migrant after many
3318340	3323700	years, you can return as a tourist or you can return as a participant. Participating means that
3323700	3330100	you begin to take responsibility again. That seems to me very, very fair, very democratic.
3330900	3336660	By the time you are a child, nine or 10, there's little things that you're given to do, and you're
3336660	3343140	understood that you're part of a collective and you have to do, etc. That seems to me as nothing
3343140	3350500	voluntaristic. There is nothing voluntaristic. It's a collective decision-making on the basis,
3351060	3357780	calculated on the basis of the resources that are available, not out of some imagination,
3357780	3365060	but on the basis of this is like a high mounting place, but where there is a culture of collectivity
3365780	3372020	and is a culture that gives a tremendous protection. You're not born in, you know,
3372020	3378820	that the community will support you and where there's an immense solidarity also with the
3378820	3384420	people who die. You know, the dead, there is a cult of the dead, the dead are present.
3384980	3390580	You know, as soon as somebody dies, there's enormous amount she described by everybody. So
3390580	3397540	the death is not as fear as the end. The sense of belonging to something is something that you
3397540	3405700	understand, extend your life beyond your physical life, which is a great sense of power. Instead of
3405700	3412340	the sense of desperation and finitude, thinking, oh my God, all is lost, because you are actually
3412340	3417060	part of a collective body. You're beginning to feel that there's a collective breath and a
3417060	3424900	collective body, very powerful. And, but there are, you know, from the very early age, the idea
3424900	3429860	that, yeah, you have to do something. And if you don't, if you don't do anything, then you should
3429860	3434420	not make the decision. You don't speak in the assembly unless you've done the work. I think
3434420	3440740	it's a great idea, by the way. I think it's a great idea that we should use and it's not
3440740	3448260	voluntaristic. Yeah, I understand. And, but would you say then that this is always tightly coupled
3448260	3458260	to a contextual idea of community? Because this agreement, so to speak, is more or less based on
3458260	3467300	rules that are part of a cultural socialization, so to speak. And do you think that this can be
3468020	3476180	achieved in larger context as well, or in a really large scale context as well? Or does it need to be
3476740	3486340	kind of more or less tied to a community that has a certain size and is therefore able to,
3487060	3494020	let's say, put practice behind this ideal so that it is not just an abstract rule?
3494660	3499380	Yeah, but this is the idea, right? First of all, I think there's a struggle also in these
3499380	3504260	indigenous communities, and what I understand talking to women from indigenous communities,
3504260	3511220	to expand the community so that, for example, people who are not being raised in that culture
3511220	3518980	can also be part of it, for example, through marriage and other forms. And so these communities
3518980	3526980	are not frozen. And I think that the women are, in fact, the most important agent of change.
3528020	3535540	But this goes back to the idea of how to be organized, because if we are talking about real
3535540	3542900	democracy and people making decisions about their life, then there has to be a certain rootedness
3542900	3549060	in the sense that you have to know your locality. You have to know the possibilities.
3549060	3554500	You cannot make decisions for places far away for the fishermen when you are in the mountain.
3555060	3562020	So the idea of the Confederacy, the idea of exchanges, the idea of, you know, what I was
3562020	3569700	talking before, you know, the assembly might be a thousand people, but then you connect with the
3569700	3576500	assembly right all across the highlands of Guatemala. It doesn't mean that because,
3577220	3583300	you know, you have a decision making by a community which is somewhat limited in size
3584260	3596580	and has commitment that relate to all kinds of decision and cultural practices that date from,
3597220	3605620	doesn't mean that you don't also open to other similar communities and that you don't have
3605620	3612420	exchanges. The question is when you begin to have a decision making that is removed
3613940	3619780	from the people who are actually suffering the consequences of that decision making.
3620500	3627300	And here we cannot have it two ways. If you want to be in control of the consequences
3627300	3634020	of decision making, then you cannot make decisions on a global level. I cannot decide for people in
3634020	3642260	Patagonia. I cannot make decisions for people that cry. I can struggle with them when they ask me
3642260	3649620	solidarity to fight against fracking in Patagonia. I can struggle with them, but I cannot make
3649620	3655460	decisions for the people in Patagonia. And we don't have got to go as far as Patagonia, but I mean,
3655460	3664660	I cannot make decisions for people in Colorado or in Alabama, right? But I can struggle with them
3664660	3671300	because obviously we'll have similar conditions, et cetera, et cetera. And we have those agreements.
3671300	3677220	So I think that this is what we have. And of course, back to the original point,
3677860	3683300	that the struggle is the gray field of experimentation and the gray field of
3683300	3689460	transformation. This change to this new society, to a society where we have this culture, where
3689460	3696020	we have this commitment, where we have this solidarity, it's going to be a tremendous
3696020	3703220	process of transformation. We all carry a lot of capitalism within ourselves. The struggle does
3703220	3709140	not only transform the world, but has to transform who we are. There's one question I ask all of my
3709140	3714500	guests at the end, and this is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
3716260	3723860	What is the alternative? I have to be joyful. I have to be joyful because I'm like, you know,
3723860	3735460	I often quote a poem, a poet from Greece, 1300 BC, 1000, Mimmo Nermo. He wrote something that I
3735460	3744900	learned as a, you know, a young person and stayed with me. Life is a tragedy, it's a comedy or a
3744900	3754180	tragedy. And you either learn to laugh of the most great sufferings, or you'll forever cry.
3754980	3763860	You know, and it's not laugh, but it's an affirmation of life. It's an affirmation of life.
3763860	3772100	And here I want to end quoting Maria Mies, quoting Maria Mies, my great sister who died,
3772740	3780340	and it's been a great pain to lose her. And she used to tell the story, she was full of life,
3781380	3788900	life-affirming person, very creative, very life-affirming. And she used to think of her
3788900	3796260	mother, who at the end of World War II, when the whole world in Germany, you can imagine,
3796260	3803380	right, in ruin, in front of a life of ruin, she pulled up her sleeves and, you know,
3803380	3810740	this was a peasant community and bought a few piglets and said, well, life has to go on,
3810740	3820660	I still have to feed my children. And this, you know, in Ecofeminism, a book that she wrote
3820660	3827460	with Vandana Shiva, in the introduction to it, you know, there is a beautiful, beautiful sentence
3827460	3833060	that I almost memorize, I see if I can, you know, it says that when in this world,
3833700	3839460	in this world of capitalism, that is devoted, seems to be devoted to the destruction,
3839460	3848180	to such a destruction of nature and human life, our world can be summed up in terms of a struggle,
3848180	3855220	you know, to nourish, to nourish the impulse, the great impulse, which is in every living thing,
3855780	3860100	which is the impulse to reproduce themselves, which is in how to live, to continue.
3860740	3870340	And this is what, you know, I, this is what makes me, makes me, gives me joy, is to see
3871140	3878020	that we have to start with what is living, with what is moving, with what the new children are
3878020	3885380	born every day. What do we say to them? Oh, too late, too late. Capitalism is destroyed
3885380	3891620	too much, but they are born now. So we have to give them something. Wonderful. Sylvia,
