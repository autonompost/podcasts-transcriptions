0	5640	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome
5640	9000	Antoinette Rovois in today's episode.
9000	13760	It's a Future Histories live episode that you are about to hear, meaning it has been
13760	19680	recorded in front of an audience, in this case, in the context of the workshop Biological
19680	25820	Life and Political Cybernetics that took place in December 22 in Vienna.
25820	32460	And I want to thank the organizers Anna Verena-Nosthoff, Eugenia Stamboljeff and Vessel Reyes for
32460	36640	the possibility to take part in this, it has been great, thanks a lot.
36640	42140	And I am happy to announce that this is not a single workshop, but a series of workshops
42140	48140	on the topic of political cybernetics and that I myself will organize an instance of
48140	54620	this series at Kiel University as part of the research project Governing Algorithms.
55280	58480	I'll definitely keep you updated on that.
58480	64820	I also want to send a quick shout out to the Critical Data Lab, which I'm also affiliated
64820	71560	to and which was, through Anna Verena-Nosthoff, also involved in the organization of the Political
71560	74400	Cybernetics Workshop in Vienna.
74400	78720	Many thanks to everybody involved in general, it has been a pleasure.
78720	84480	Before we start, I would like to welcome Manchu and Dahlia as patrons of Future Histories
84480	90240	and I want to thank Fabian, Lucas and Karl for their kind donations.
90240	97240	And now, please enjoy today's episode with Antoinette Rovois on Algorithmic Governmentality.
102740	107280	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome
107280	110340	Antoinette Rovois in today's episode.
110340	115960	She is a permanent research associate at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research
115960	120560	and a researcher and professor at the University of Namur in Belgium.
120560	126360	Her work centers around evolving normativities at the interface of legal theory, philosophy
126360	132280	and science and technology studies using, for course, insights on questions of government.
132280	137060	She has developed an analytic framework called Algorithmic Governmentality, which we will
137060	139420	explore in today's conversation.
139500	140620	Welcome Antoinette.
140620	141620	Thank you.
141620	142620	Thank you for having me.
142620	144120	It's a great pleasure.
144120	148080	Let's maybe start with a broad definition for people who are not familiar with your
148080	149080	work.
149080	150080	What is algorithmic governmentality?
150080	159880	Well, I must first say that my intention with that concept or that notion or that non-concept
159880	166540	rather of algorithmic governmentality has never been to find the right epochal ladder
166540	169280	for something like a social totality.
169280	175740	If I speak of governmentality, it is precisely in order to avoid delimiting the social as
175740	176740	a totality.
176740	184220	I don't speak of algorithmic society any more than of a surveillance society.
184220	189840	Algorithmic governmentality does not, in the sense that I use the term, designate a particular
189840	196580	mode of government which would have more or less replaced or been juxtaposited to the
196640	202160	forms of sovereignty, pastorate, discipline, normalization, control and so on that Foucault
202160	206920	and in fact, Foucault himself did not consider that sovereignty, surveillance, discipline,
206920	213260	control and so on corresponded to a strict chronologic periodization.
213260	217920	It was not for him a series in which the elements follow one another.
217920	224660	It is rather a complex edifice in which the center of gravity shifts in the systems of
224760	231440	correlations between legality, discipline, security, control and I would add with Felix
231440	240240	Guattari integration and I would add with a lot of you, with most of you, recursivity.
240240	244160	These shift at the core of governmental rationalities.
244160	251460	The way I try to inherit of the non-concept of governmentality from Foucault is I must
251460	259800	concede right away quite unfaithful, at least partially, to the original meaning ascribed
259800	265760	to the term by Michel Foucault in the series of lectures he held at the Coll√®ge de France
265760	275640	in 1978 and 1973 and I would say that because since I wrote about algorithmic governmentality
275720	284520	first, it was a long, long time ago, my own thinking has evolved and I have come to understand
284520	291620	that in fact algorithmic governmentality or algorithmic capitalism was not a mode of ordering
291620	292620	of the world.
292620	301580	It is not a mode of organization, but it's rather a tactic or a system of disorganization
301620	311520	of organized and strategic disruption, which is highly profitable to the ones who Mackenzie
311520	314520	work called the vectorialist class.
314520	323080	But of course, we are all part of this and I will try to develop that a little bit later.
323080	331720	So I refer to, also I must say right away that I refer to governmentality mainly as
331720	338560	a methodological perspective that orients our attention away from the classical invariance
338560	344020	of political science, the state, institutions, the subjects.
344020	350100	From a governmentality perspective, the state, institutions, the subjects are not presupposed
350180	352480	or pre-existent to governmentality.
352480	356220	They are rather it's byproducts.
356220	368380	So governmentality allows me to try to diagnose or to produce a kind of clinics or analytics
368380	375140	of a series of semiotic, epistemic, normative, strategic, anthropological, ethical shifts
375180	381600	in the processes or techniques of signification, that is production of meaning, in techniques
381600	385940	of power or domination and in techniques of the self.
385940	393020	Foucault's notion of governmentality or what he calls governmental rationality, which corresponds
393020	399160	in this sense to what, for example, Castoriadis calls the imaginary institution of society
399180	408200	is above all, for me, a way of making consistent, of articulating, of showing the entanglement
408200	415840	in each era of a set of techniques of signification, meaning making, techniques of production,
415840	420120	techniques of power and techniques of self.
420120	429080	This being said, what I have as a target are indeed the new effects of reliability or credibility
430000	441000	in the post-truth era where we are, as is often said, the unprecedented effects of power
441000	449800	or operationality without authority, and therefore responsibility, or the force without law,
449800	456680	and an individualization or molecularization and deterritorialization without subjects.
456680	463040	Therefore, I speak with others of inhuman biopolitics, the instrumental unit of power
463040	472800	being not anymore the population, individuals, or the bodies, but only meaningless data.
472800	479520	So this being said about governmentality, now, why algorithmic governmentality?
479520	486480	My algorithmic governmentality with my colleague Thomas Berns, we had in mind a kind of hypothesis
487280	493320	a hypothesis of a government of the social world based on the algorithmic meaning automatic
493320	501120	processing of the massive data proliferating from our behaviors by behaviors, I understand
501120	508400	all the interactions we have with the environment, relationships, interactions, trajectories,
508400	509740	and so on.
509740	517620	So processing of massive data proliferating from our behaviors rather than on politics,
517620	522860	law, social norms, in a multitude of sectors of activity and government.
522860	530540	We therefore call algorithmic government or algorithmic governmentality a mode of government
530540	537100	which is productive not of norms, neither of standards or rules, which in fact fails
537180	544100	to adjudicate and which is fed essentially by raw data, by which I mean,
544100	549500	intrapersonal and significant but quantifiable signals.
550740	557380	Also, algorithmic governmentality operates by anticipatory configurations of possibilities
557380	565620	through anticipatory optimization of environments rather than by regulation, permission, prohibition,
565620	566340	and so on.
567260	576060	But as I will tell, no, my current thought about it is rather that, in fact, it's not
576060	588060	even trying to govern anything, it's rather trying to render power absolutely agile, able
588060	595420	to be resilient to any kind of transformation, any kind of emergence.
595420	604620	So that's really the speculative term that algorithmic governmentality marks.
606540	613420	So we have also defined in some of our papers algorithmic governmentality very broadly
614140	621660	as a certain type of normative or apolitical rationality founded or grounded on the automated
621660	627740	collection, aggregation, and analysis of big data so as to model, anticipate, and
627740	630700	preemptively affect possible behaviors.
632140	640060	So, of course, when reading and rereading Foucault and Deleuze, I realized it was not
640060	642140	very, very original.
642140	651260	In fact, already in 1979, Foucault announced this on the horizon of liberal governmentality
651980	659100	what appears is not at all the idea or the project of an exhaustively disciplinary society
659100	665260	in which the legal network, enclosing individuals, would be related and extended from within
665260	670860	by, let us say, normative mechanisms, nor is it a society in which the mechanisms of
670860	676460	general normalization and exclusion of the non-normalizable would be required.
677100	683420	On the contrary, on the horizon is the image or the idea or theme of a society in which
683420	688700	there would be optimization of systems of difference, in which the field would be left open
688700	694940	to auxiliary processes, in which there would be tolerance for minority individuals and
694940	699900	practices, in which there would be action not on the players of the game but on the
699900	704860	rules of the game, and finally, in which there would be intervention not on the type of
704860	711740	internal subjugation of individuals but intervention of an environmental type.
713420	719180	In the next lesson, Foucault reminded of the heterodox definition of economics given by
719180	727020	Gary Baker, the science of systematicity of responses to environmental variations, a
727020	732540	definition Foucault told us which can perfectly include the behavioral techniques that had been
732540	740540	promoted in particular by Skinner about whom Foucault also writes that he was hostile to the
740540	747580	use of statistics, that he considers that individual behaviors must be studied, which presupposes
747580	753660	that we control the environment in which we place the subject and that we define measures
753660	761420	of response which are informative. When a subject moves in his environment, some of his behaviors
761420	767900	produce detectable changes in the environment, the reinforcement contingencies. The operant
767900	774460	response is a class of responses defined by the consequences they have for the subject and issued
774460	779660	in a given situation without being causally dependent on a stimulus in the situation.
779660	787100	That's really the kind of data behaviorism that I have tried to describe, in which in fact
787100	793340	insights replace knowledge and in fact it completely disturbs that the idea that
795180	802540	Foucault had that in fact power is always based and co-produced with knowledge.
802540	808780	Here the conjunction of knowledge and power is completely exploded. There is no need for
808860	817260	knowledge to govern and it's even the opposite. It's a way through which contingency and
817260	827980	non-knowledge and ignorance become the target of speculative and leveraging strategies.
827980	840620	So we are not exactly in the situation described by Foucault. Why? Of course we perceive all that
840620	849740	modulation that we have left modernist way of government and so on, but I would say we are
849740	859660	even further than what he anticipated in 79. Why is it? Because in fact there is no action
859660	863900	on the rules of the game or if there are actions on the rules of the game,
864700	872940	these rules are not even any more detectable or subjectively recognizable by the players.
872940	880060	Why is that? Because in algorithmic governmentality what we notice is that even
880060	888300	metrics against which behaviors or performances are evaluated, ranked, scored and so on,
889340	895740	metrics have become increasingly plastic. They are not fixed. They are not knowable in advance.
895820	904780	They are moving and evolving according to the behaviors of all others. What that means is
904780	913420	that we are not any more confronted with the kind of subject produced by algorithmic governmentality
913420	921740	is completely at odds with the notion of the homo hemoconomicus described by Gary Becker,
922220	934620	the homo economicus who had to invest rationally in his own human capital by being able to
934620	946060	anticipate what kind of returns his investment would grant him. No, people never know how they
946060	956380	will be evaluated and the metrics are so moving that in fact we can have the impression that this
956380	965820	shift from modernist normativity towards recursive plasticity of abnormativity,
966300	978060	that cybernetic mode of government, it can appear really emancipatory but it is paid,
978860	987900	it is at the cost of transforming individuals into people who are completely addicted
987900	995100	to credit so they have to find credit to gain attention, to gain audience, to be
995100	1004780	noticed, it means to occupy a node in the network. So in fact it's a kind of anomaly,
1004780	1014380	that's the reason why in beginning to respond too long to your question, I said it's a system
1014380	1023980	of disorganization. It's a system of disorganization because it fragments all subjectively and
1023980	1034220	collectively recognizable forms into pure decontextualized signals which are re-aggregated
1034220	1043580	at an industrial scale which is not personal nor collective nor nothing, which are pure speculative
1043580	1052700	in which pure speculative spaces are created, speculative spaces of opportunities and risks.
1054060	1059580	I have the impression that I have transformed this discussion into a monologue so don't
1059580	1068380	hesitate to interrupt me if you wish. Well I'll just wait until you have finished making your
1068380	1076300	point so that's all right with me. Okay so maybe in order to give some
1076300	1088700	consistency, some materiality to what I'm saying here, I guess just a few examples.
1089340	1095660	For example there is a new system of employee monitoring developed by Amazon in its warehouse
1095660	1103020	and in the vehicle of their delivery drivers. In the online presentation Amazon presents the
1103020	1109180	monitoring system as humanizing the interaction transportation companies have with their drivers
1109180	1117020	to enhance driving performance. Indeed what matters in this humanization is to enable
1117020	1123580	artificial intelligence systems to better understand or rather better act as if they
1123580	1130380	understood the humans in their interactions with their environment. Of course what matters to
1130380	1136620	Amazon is not at all understanding or legibility of each individual employee, their motivations,
1136620	1143420	their intentions or the singularity of their experiences. In fact individual warehouse
1143420	1150380	workers are eminently substituable or replaceable anyway. It is not their singularity that Amazon
1150380	1157660	has an interest in nor is Amazon primarily interested in acquiring knowledge about the
1157660	1164540	productivity of the workforce in general but rather it's interested in rendering individual
1164540	1170940	workers every move computable in a data behaviorist paradigm. This is the kind of
1170940	1176300	data behaviorism allowing humanization of interactions contemplated by Amazon.
1177980	1184620	To humanize in this discourse means to scale power down to the molecular level,
1185100	1191820	to leverage particularities not singularities but particularities. Conveniently from the
1191820	1199900	perspective of a neoliberal management these particularities escape both subjective identification,
1199900	1203420	recognition and collective perception and discussion.
1205820	1211260	It is of course as I said not the singularity of individual experiences that are of interest to
1211260	1217500	Amazon nor the regularities observed in the workforce population but rather the mostly
1217500	1224060	subliminal particularities of behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. The individual and
1224060	1232380	collective trade unionist and so on subjects how they may or may not acknowledge experiences
1232380	1239820	their own and so on do not matter at all. They disappear from powers gaze. Singular and collective
1239820	1246220	experiences drastically fall in value and power operates on the mode of machining enslavement
1246220	1254220	rather than social subjection. So enabling everything to be connected to communicate
1254220	1261660	or synchronize with everything else in almost real time the computational term appears to
1261660	1268540	disqualify all kinds of representations including predictions based on statistical representations
1268540	1274540	which never pretend to be adequate to the world but merely to provide approximative representations
1274540	1282780	of it with an objective of neutrality. All these even statistical representations are felt as
1282780	1291820	anarchisms sorry archaisms in favor of a post-representational recursive paradigm of
1291900	1299100	disintermediated access to the digital real in high resolution which is also a high dissolution
1299660	1306620	at the pre-semiotic stage emancipated from the symbolic order from the tyranny of the signifier
1306620	1315740	from the imperialism of language itself. So and I will end maybe my attempt to
1316540	1320860	to not define algorithmic or neutrality by this I would say that
1322940	1329020	the aim but I will maybe later further explain this the aim is not so much to manage or influence
1329020	1335500	the individuals and groups but to render power absolutely agile capable of leveraging the
1335500	1341660	contingency of individual and collective behaviors whereas data drivenness attest to the replacement
1341660	1350060	of both the commodity form and currency by assets all that matters is the convertibility
1350060	1357820	of contingent data into speculative assets so the hallmark of power in algorithmic regime
1357820	1365260	is not so much that it would look at us spy on us but rather that it literally bypass the visual
1365260	1373100	epistem the phenomenological perceptual systems of recognition of qualification of judgment of
1373100	1379420	categories in favors of systems of recursive computation as a consequence algorithmic
1379420	1385260	governmentality is quite indifferent to what is present to what appears consistent and real to
1385260	1391740	our ordinary senses as it shifts towards the forward-looking detection of contingent patterns
1391740	1398540	as novel latent speculative spaces which are in no way subjectively or collectively recognizable
1399660	1410300	so yes maybe I don't know if this fits as a broad indication of
1411180	1418780	what algorithmic governmentality is about as a problem. Yes well let me jump in I would be
1418780	1425180	interested at this point in in two things one would be that in one of your texts at some point
1425180	1431660	you coming from this critique of algorithmic governmentality you continue to argue for a
1431660	1437260	quote-unquote return to reality so I would be interested actually what you mean by reality in
1437260	1443420	this case so what is it coming from this critique that you try to bring forward maybe as a I don't
1443420	1449020	know how to call it then counter ontology I don't know maybe so maybe you could state what you mean
1449020	1453980	with reality in this case this is one of the the questions that I have and the other one would be
1453980	1459980	that when reading the texts from time to time I was asking myself whether or not these descriptions
1459980	1465980	that you give of algorithmic governmentality I got the impression that they do absolutely fit
1466620	1473740	for some form of imaginary of algorithmic governing but that if we look at the
1474620	1482940	actual practice that this is not really an adequate description of how things are really
1482940	1490380	going going down and one example for this would be this phrase of raw data is an oxymoron and you
1490380	1496060	yourself state that the people who are actually working with these technologies are very much
1496060	1502700	aware that there that there are so many hands reaching into the algorithm that there is always
1502700	1508780	a co-production between the algorithm and the the humans who are working with it so that there is
1508780	1515580	not actually this place of perfection that you kind of describe when talking about algorithmic
1515580	1521980	governmentality who seems to be omnipotent when hearing about the critique and of course it's
1521980	1528700	powerful but it's not omnipotent and it didn't yet succeed in getting rid of the human I would say so
1528700	1534620	there is already this aspect of interpretation there's already this aspect of entanglement
1534620	1543260	there's already this aspect of human co-production always in place already in capitalist cybernetics
1543260	1547020	as well yes of course I hear what you say but I
1549260	1554860	I think that that's the most maybe the most difficult thing to to to to transmit
1556940	1563740	in fact what I say what I speak about what I speak about and I speak about it in my text as well
1564460	1571260	it it's a technical ideology it's a technical ideology of big data it means that what I speak
1571260	1579740	about is the kind of pretension but a pretension that even you know the designers of the of the
1579740	1587980	technology data scientists and so on they they are not naive realists they they know they know that
1587980	1595420	in fact big data doesn't mean exhaustivity that automatization or or algorithm don't
1595820	1605420	mean doesn't mean objectivity that non-selectivity or less obvious selectivity
1605420	1614140	doesn't mean impartiality and so on I think in fact and and that's the reason also why I
1615500	1624300	I refer to problematization the basic question I ask to myself first is is why is you know the
1625420	1632380	turning to algorithm and ambient intelligence artificial intelligence big data and so so on
1632380	1636940	why are these solutions presented as solutions without
1639420	1646380	and appearing as something absolutely obvious whereas they are presented by solution as solutions
1646380	1652140	but the kind of problem to which they are presented as a solution against which which they are
1652140	1661340	presented as solutions is never clearly stated and my my perception is that it is precisely
1661340	1674780	because in our society we we have a hatred for averages we all want to be unique and recognized
1674780	1681980	as unique we don't want to be part of a category anymore we want we all we all want personalization
1681980	1690780	and so on means that in fact there is a radical crisis of representation and by this I mean
1691980	1697820	not only the perception that all kinds of representations through which we perceive the
1697820	1705580	world is misleading is ideological is is politically suspect and so on it's not that
1706540	1716700	I think that there is behind this success of the algorithmic turn there is a kind of mystic
1716700	1724140	a mystic of immanence a mystic or a belief that it is in it would be possible at last
1724860	1731580	to touch rationally on the world and the things in themselves it is very close to the
1731740	1739740	speculative turn and the speculative realism in philosophy that's the reason why I'm writing
1739740	1748460	was about algorithmic realism but it's it's very it's of course absolutely absolutely
1749260	1759180	ideological of course the human is everywhere the human is in the it's the human who who designs or
1759180	1766940	who inscribes the the objective function the objective function of the algorithm
1766940	1776380	what is it it is the it's the indication of or the cost function it indicates what has to be
1776380	1780460	what has to be maximized what has to be minimized what has to be
1780940	1790860	optimized of course that objective function is nothing but the the formalization of the
1790860	1798140	sectoral sectorial interest or the sectorial logic of of the actor who's using the algorithm
1798140	1805500	so there there is there is a human there there is the human of course in social reality itself
1805500	1809420	and the mere fact the mere transcription of social reality of social
1810780	1817260	into into digital data which appear as facts I speak of a new kind of facticity
1817260	1823500	the simple transformation of reality of that reality social reality complex and so on into
1824140	1826540	data doesn't purge doesn't
1830700	1838300	expurgate that reality from all the domination the repose of domination relation over dominations
1838300	1845420	and so on in fact as you say data raw data don't exist it it's not only that raw data is always
1846300	1849500	of course it is it's a it's a patient work of
1852380	1859980	of this indexization anonymization and so on producing raw data is a is a hard work
1859980	1869500	but it's not it's not only that it's also that producing raw data is organizing the amnesia
1869500	1874620	of data with regard to their the condition of their production that's the reason why it's
1874620	1880540	I say it's a it's ideological it hides its own conditions of of production so
1885020	1892860	so it's not that I in the question you you sent me I read that I don't only criticize the concept
1892860	1899180	of a truth founded in probability I I never I I never criticized the concept of a truth
1899180	1905100	founded in probability because following Foucault for me truth the notion of truth
1906060	1913900	is always the result of truth regimes truth regime it's truth is always produced it's something that
1913900	1922140	is added to the world it's nothing nothing that you can find in the world and that's the also you
1922140	1931340	know the the false promise of of big data or the idea of the ideology of the technical ideology of
1931340	1939260	big data is the idea that knowledge shouldn't have to be produced anymore that it can be discovered
1939260	1945500	in the data that it's always already imminent in the data and provided you use the right algorithm
1945500	1954380	you will you you you will find or knowledge will or truth will will arise spontaneously
1955340	1959900	that's exactly that kind of naive realism that I'm combating
1961660	1967820	the as as strongly as I can and you find that that same kind of naive realism
1968780	1978780	in a lot of of techno-critics who really work on on the idea of rendering algorithms
1979340	1985180	fair accountable transparent and so on meaning that they want to correct the algorithms with
1985180	1992860	the idea of with the idea that if algorithms are fair are just are you know are accountable and so
1992860	2002780	on then we will have a perfect access an objective access to what is you know without human
2002780	2012060	intermediation that's that this that's really mad that's the madness because I think first of all
2012060	2017580	there are several reasons of course the first obvious reason is that the notion of just the
2017580	2024220	notions notions such as justice or concepts such as justice fairness and so on are dialectical
2024220	2031580	concepts dialectical concepts are not easily formalizable into what george school nicolas
2031580	2041020	george school again call uh uh uh arithmo uh arithmomorphic concepts arithmomorphic concepts
2041020	2048620	in george school against uh uh uh civilization are concepts which are exactly what you know
2048620	2055580	the result of an optimizations of an algorithmic optimization is you know just one result yes or
2055580	2062460	not that's algorithm that's sure you know you don't have to discuss but justice is not something like
2063340	2070140	it's really dialectical it means that it's it is a concept um which has a
2071180	2077340	which is distinct of course but not discretizable not discretizable
2078620	2088700	and that's that that's hugely important maybe i can yes i will read you i i had that um that
2088700	2095580	passage of a george school george school again uh and for george school again the the the
2095580	2102060	arithmomorphic character of a concept is linked to the fact that there is a definitive discrete
2102060	2108780	border between what this and what is not what it is not what it is and what it is not the possibility
2108780	2115340	of defining a big univocal relation between a set of concepts and a numerical scale makes it
2115340	2120620	possible for example to attest to the arithmomorphic character of the concept in this set
2122460	2130380	um but but there are another kind other another world of concept which are all the concepts that
2130380	2140860	we we human use as we are uh uh because we are not inhuman and those not inhuman concepts are all
2141500	2153420	are all uh dialectical i think so um so for for reality uh i think it was a misunderstanding
2154540	2161900	there was a misunderstanding there uh if i the reality i i don't i don't remember having written
2161900	2167900	that but uh if i help you for a return to reality the kind of reality i would like to return to
2167900	2178300	is the reality that is added to the world added by our own collective productions of meaning so
2178300	2187100	um that's the dialectical reality i i would uh i would argue for there are a series of conditions
2187100	2194060	for this kind of additional uh additional uh reality to to occur
2195660	2203740	and the first conditions are special and temporal we need scenes to discuss about
2203740	2211900	dialectical concepts uh but maybe i go too too far in my answers i don't know if if it
2212540	2219180	fits what you had in mind well if it was merely a misunderstanding you think then we could continue
2219740	2224540	to other questions and i would just maybe to clear something up and since we are here on
2224540	2232300	in the workshop on um cybernetic politics i just wanted to ask if i maybe understood it wrong
2232940	2239180	right now in your answer when you pointed towards a kind of naive realism which is kind of close to
2239180	2245260	speculative realism which you say is an kind of this naive realism is an aspect of algorithmic
2245260	2251740	governmentality as well as of some of the critics i'm actually wondering because i always thought
2251740	2259980	that cybernetics actually does not really care about ontology in this sense but is absolutely
2259980	2267020	fine with something that would be called a probable truth so it's not about really kind of trying to
2267020	2274140	unveil some kind of essence i always thought that this is absolutely not a logic found within the
2274140	2282060	cybernetic paradigm but as i said instead it would totally be fine with a version that simply works
2282060	2288060	or works better than the other one so this is what i meant with a truth founded in probability
2288060	2293660	and i would say that this is really a fundamental difference so i was wondering if you think that
2293660	2299820	algorithmic governmentality is in this respect different from cybernetics or why you say that
2299820	2306540	they are trying to kind of get to the to the real because i always thought it's not about that
2307100	2313820	no indeed it's not about that i think we have to understand quite clearly the epistemic ambition
2313820	2322460	or strategic ambitions behind these machines as when they are used in a capitalist context
2323420	2329020	of course in fact with the advent of big data and machine learning
2330380	2339340	emergencies are detected in real time in a nanomic complex and purely metric digital space purely
2339340	2346300	which is the result of an abstraction but also of all kinds of of production of raw data as you as
2346300	2355100	you said which is compression and so on so but but which is purely metric which is a space which
2355100	2363900	is envisaged that's not from the topological angle of continuity and stability but from the time
2363900	2372700	based angle of contingency instability and continuously recons reconducted crisis
2374220	2382060	as a host exo adams explaining one of his paper so in that context what we have to understand
2382700	2390860	is that data doesn't don't function as as signs there they don't function as signifiers
2391660	2399660	for for something rather they function as pure differences or deferments of meaning
2400300	2409340	that are never given in their completion so to explain that a little bit i have i have to i think
2409340	2415420	go back to a comparison between um what for example adolf ketley
2416140	2422860	concept or the order between the deterministic metaphysics that for example adolf ketley
2423820	2430540	heads when founding or participating to the to the foundation of statistics and what happens
2432540	2439660	in machine learning the speculative ambitions of machine learning i think are really at odd
2439660	2446460	with the mid 19th century of ambitions of studying studying social physics like adolf ketley
2447020	2453100	whose project was to study men in his various degrees of aggregation from the individual state
2453100	2460220	to the highest state of combination which includes the whole of humanity on the contrary algorithmic
2460220	2468700	governmentality radically embraces uncertainty incommensurability contingency it it also attests
2468700	2475980	to a new mode of preemptive intervention which is no longer legitimated or justified as the ability
2475980	2483660	to act on the basis of precise knowledge of the future but on the contrary as an invincible
2483660	2492300	certainty as to what must be done in the absence of such certainty as martin conings says quite
2492300	2497740	clearly in capital and time so and the temporalities of course recursive which
2497740	2506780	changed everything so um in fact it's a dynamic mode where continuous learning where continuous
2506780	2513500	learning and production of reliability without truth including truth about people's behaviors
2513500	2519740	replace the production of temporary truth and their justifiability verifiability contestability
2520620	2527340	i would say what relates algorithmic governmentality also to cybernetic is of course the
2527340	2534140	overcoming of the notion that that of the of the separation of calculation and things
2534140	2544220	of of contents and matter and so on it resets a new kind new ontology but which is completely
2544940	2551420	disarticulated from from the notion of of of a human subject
2552700	2559260	so i don't know if it responds to you to your question i'm sure it does somehow definitely
2559260	2565260	um i would be interested because i think you have described a lot of your critique already i would
2565260	2573420	be interested in what you argue for actually so i would be interested in what is your proposition
2573420	2580060	what would you bring in against algorithmic governmentality well um i i think of course
2581420	2590220	my posture here is more descriptive of something uh which is uh which is which amounts to
2590220	2598860	capitalism on capitalism and neoliberalism realism on algorithmic steroids i know it's
2598860	2607020	not fashionable to say that uh but i think we would need uh maybe a constitutional moment
2607020	2614940	a moment uh well a moment wherein we think about a concept what is a constitution a constitution
2614940	2623100	is a text by which the present the people who are present and who sign the constitution limit
2623100	2629100	their own power they limit their own power they promise a little bit like you know
2630620	2638940	charged nature with that task of producing an animal who can promise and keep its promise
2639660	2647420	constitution does that in fact it it forces those who sign to consider
2648380	2656940	a lot of things which are irreducible to the mere optimization of the current situation or the state
2656940	2665980	of state of facts uh it allow for the consideration uh a political constitution allow for the
2665980	2675820	consideration of those who have not yet left any digital trace that can be enrolled in the calculation
2676380	2685100	of the optimal it means that it allows to preserve the space and time which would not
2685100	2693820	be preoccupied by the bulimic appetites by those who have been granted including by algorithmic
2693820	2700380	algorithmic systems granted with the force without law which allows them to transform
2701100	2708140	the virtual the not yet there the possibilities into into surplus value
2709180	2719980	so it's it's uh i think we have to find ways to enforce uh new uh a new intelligence of
2719980	2728140	limits a new intelligence of limits because uh this intelligence of limits which life itself
2728140	2737980	has very well as a kangelem has shown us that normativity of life itself but we have to to
2739180	2745100	to to find that there are several kinds of because i'm a lawyer by so i maybe i'm a bit
2745100	2752860	distorted as all lawyers but i'm distorted uh uh and i try to go back to my own discipline you know
2752860	2761580	as a as a safe island um but we have instruments uh the constitution we have the notion of
2761580	2767340	institution what is an institution it's all that algorithmic governmentality tries to um
2768940	2776940	to render obsolete in fact um the notion of according to david yume uh the role of institutions
2776940	2786700	is in fact to force the agents you me uh elon musk uh donald trump everyone to force people
2787340	2796300	to transcend the partiality of their natural sympathies you know um david yume was not for
2796300	2803660	the social contract because he among other reasons he thought the problem of our society of society
2803660	2809900	is not the egoism of individuals in fact people are not egoistic because they can sacrifice
2809900	2816140	themselves for for the the ones they care for for their children and so on the problem is the
2816140	2825340	partiality of these natural sympathies and only institutions can force people to refrain uh from
2825340	2832860	their uh impulsion or compulsion to optimize that is to to to take the most they can of the present
2832860	2839660	and of the future and of everything that is that is there and only only institution can force them
2840540	2847340	to consider what is not already there for them to consume in fact so we we need that we need that
2848860	2854140	no we need to rethink the role of kind of institutions and but fast because we don't
2854140	2865660	have much time in front of systems in fact that push everyone uh towards self-optimization and
2865660	2871020	consumption of of everything that's what i said at the beginning algorithmic
2871020	2876860	governmentality is a way of fragmenting all collectives immunizing i would say capitalism
2876860	2886060	against all and every form that should and and would in fact interrupt its flaws that is the
2886060	2896780	world the material world and its limits the social the social the collective it fragments the
2896780	2905020	collective it's a it's a high resolution which is also a high dissolution and life itself in fact
2905020	2914060	life itself with with its own uh negantropic regulations that i i really believe that
2914060	2921580	nick land was right when he said that there is a common teleology between cybernetics and capitalism
2921580	2929180	and that terrible uh teleology is really necropolitic i believe so that that's the
2929180	2942220	reason why we urgently need to reconcile with the notion that uh anyway we have to invent
2942220	2947100	the forms including the political forms the institutional forms the constitutional forms
2947820	2954540	which uh institute our life in common and alain supior had it right when he said the
2954540	2960860	anthropologic function of law is to articulate together the different facets of human being
2960860	2970300	these facets being the physiological the symbolic and the social if we agree to translate or to
2970300	2979740	consider that all these different facets or layers are transcriber or reducible into
2980620	2989340	reducible to pure flaws of of digital computable data and that this is enough for us to to to
2990220	2997900	to govern ourselves i think we do a big mistake i think i would have to kind of dig a little
2997900	3006220	deeper into this answer because um i guess it's not as simple as simply reverting back to like
3006220	3013900	the law as it was the uh sovereign as it was the individual as it was so if we want to find
3013900	3020060	answers to this as you frame it kind of assault of algorithmic governmentality then first of all we
3020060	3026220	would have to ask are they the the proper tools in terms of are they adequate for the task and then
3026220	3031180	of course i think we had we would have to rethink them because i mean they are not innocent in
3031180	3037500	themselves the law is not innocent the the the liberal subject for sure is not innocent and so
3037500	3044220	on so i would like to know at some point maybe this would be a good good example at some point
3044220	3052220	you state that you think that actually we would have to stick with the fictional individual
3052220	3058460	because it's kind of operationable it serves a purpose and that we need this purpose and
3058460	3063580	while knowing that it is a fiction we still need it and i was wondering how far you would go with
3063580	3070060	these things because i think it's kind of a play with fire but maybe positively speaking it's
3070060	3075660	staying with the trouble in terms of done a hero way but i would be interested um whether or not
3075660	3080620	we would have to kind of rethink these elements that you bring forward against algorithmic
3080620	3087580	governmentality yes i think my response will be much simpler than your answer
3088300	3095820	i'm afraid but i must state what's a subject for me what's the form subject for me the form subject
3095820	3105260	is the content is void subjects are processes in constant overcoming of themselves subjects are
3105260	3111340	becomeings there are processes of individuation processes of subjectivation and so on so
3111980	3119020	notion of subject is eminently dynamic so i'm not nostalgic at all of the subject conceived as the
3120060	3126540	as the liberalism conceived it as its fundamental unit unitary master of its own intentionality
3127180	3132460	separated from others and so on not at all my notion of the subject is completely different and
3132460	3139820	i have come to consider that the subject the role that the subject plays the subject is a point of
3139820	3146860	view it's nothing else than a point of view so the world needs the subjects because the subject
3146860	3154140	is the point of view from which objects may appear despite their ontological indetermination
3154780	3164620	um as barad and so on uh would say and at the same time subjects need objects because also
3164620	3172460	objects reflect their own position so it's a it's really a notion of the subject as um
3173980	3183420	both as power subject as power of individuation or as a potentiality of individuation has never
3183420	3190060	completely enclosed in any present but it's a process that is lived and experienced and
3190060	3195980	constructed and deconstructed all the time over time over always over time so my notion of the
3195980	3205020	subject is a heterochronic notion it's absolutely heterochronic that's the reason why uh the uh
3205740	3213340	absorption in in the pure vortex of real time of everything by algorithmic governmentality
3213340	3221180	is absolutely inhuman it's not habitable because we we are we are over time so that notion of the
3221180	3228780	subject i think the subject like an actor it is because i'm a lawyer the notion of person persona
3228780	3237660	person is the mask it's a mask that people put on their face when they have to act uh on a stage
3237660	3243980	on a stage but also on the stage of the of the of a judicial court for example
3244940	3254940	the notion the person is is inseparable from all the kinds of editorializations
3255580	3264460	that we perform all the time but we are we are nothing else we are nothing else than these
3264460	3272220	editorializations there is no subject without a form the form is the subject so that's the reason
3272220	3277980	why the legal subject for example is is a functional fiction it's something that the law needs
3278860	3286940	but it's but but the law knows that it's a fiction it's a place it's a location from which
3287500	3295580	to make one's situation or the situation of the people who share an existential experience of
3295580	3304860	discrimination for example together being a person before the law is being able to give account
3305900	3316540	of injustice felt injustice felt problems to in fact it's a way of mattering and of determining
3316540	3324780	or contributing to the definition of what matters what's a problem and what needs solution so it's
3324780	3334380	quite pragmatic i would say but not only it's not only pragmatic i think it's also in a way ontologic
3334380	3340700	but it's an ontology which is absolutely non-essentialist before asking my last
3340700	3346860	question i would love to go to a place where we have been today in this workshop already
3347420	3351980	i'm very much interested in this question of alternative arts of government and there's this
3351980	3359340	famous quote by fukuh which i read out today earlier already and the quote goes what
3359340	3363820	governmentality is possible as a strictly intrinsically and autonomously socialist
3363820	3370220	governmentality in any case we know only that if there is a really socialist governmentality
3370220	3376460	then it is not hidden within socialism and its texts it cannot be deduced from them it must be
3376460	3384060	invented and quote and as i understand it your critique is a critique of algorithmic governmentality
3384060	3390780	as a techno capitalist governmentality and not all of it will necessarily apply for other uses of
3390780	3397180	these technologies in other contexts so maybe let's turn to the the question of construction again
3397180	3403260	to the question of alternative in a positive sense what could this invention of desirable
3403260	3409900	alternative governmentalities look like well i completely rejoined you when saying that you
3409900	3417500	know and that's the the virtue of problematization is is to avoid technological determinism or you
3417500	3427020	know today technologies are the ideal uh how you say scapegoat all the problems are
3428300	3435340	we project all our problems on technologies it's because of of social networks that democracy is
3435340	3443660	dysfunctional it's because of no no it's much broader than that uh of course so i i think
3443660	3451900	there's no fatality in the fact that these uh technologies today are used in order to
3451900	3460700	to boost uh capitalism and to accelerate uh to accelerate uh towards uh towards apocalysm
3460700	3467180	apocalypse by apocalypse i mean precisely not the end of the world but the the end of the end of
3467260	3478060	capitalism in fact um the smartness the smartness of these technologies is precisely
3479180	3486700	that's uh through big data and machine learning we can become
3488940	3496060	aware we can see regularities of the world which are only observable on on huge numbers
3496860	3503660	so it's a question of scale so in fact what they produce also what they can produce are alternative
3503660	3512060	maps of the world and of events which can be very interesting for i give you an example there are a
3512060	3520780	lot of discussions today about the possibility the legitimacy or the opportunity of using
3520780	3529740	algorithmic systems in in the judicial uh in the judicial system algorithmic decision making
3530620	3540780	as to help judges for example and so on to take decisions um in fact what would be interesting
3540780	3548540	what is interesting is that big data analytics allow for example to give to to to give to the
3548540	3556140	judges a mirror of how the law functions you know it can give it can give very precious
3556140	3563820	informations about the state of the law as it is practiced what kind of decisions are taken and so
3563820	3575180	on so as a as a we can look at ourselves in big data and it gives us an image a certain image
3575180	3581660	which is not deprived of a point of view because algorithms have point of view
3582380	3588220	uh point the point of view of an algorithm i would say it's its objective function it depends of oh
3588220	3594940	how the algorithm has been constructed and so on it depends on what kind of sensors are used to
3594940	3601260	collect the data what kind of data are considered noise and what kind of data are considered signals
3601260	3609020	and so on so there are point of view but it can allow us to be uh alerted
3610700	3617020	about specificities or singularities of the world that we would not or of our
3617020	3624220	or of our own behaviors that we would not notice otherwise so it can increase our intelligence
3624220	3633100	instead of depriving us from intelligence the risk being of course that we overestimate the
3633820	3642300	objectivity the scientificity of these productions no they are not more scientific not more objective
3642300	3648700	than human judgment it's just that the world is looked at from a different perspective
3648700	3654780	when looked at from the perspective of an algorithm we have to know about all the
3654780	3661420	biases the basis of the humans but the basis of the algorithms as well and there are a lot there
3661420	3667980	are a lot and and they're difficult to to detect sometimes because for example the distinction
3667980	3674860	between uh what is a signal and what is noise is not decided by an institution in algorithmic
3674860	3686220	governmentality it's it is just uh it is set it is that distinction is set in a in a way which is
3687580	3694860	undergenius to the the socio-mediatic reality so it's evolving all the time so it's quite
3694860	3700700	difficult to know exactly what the point of view of the algorithm is and that's the difficulty
3700700	3708300	that's the difficulty but that difficulty is quite interesting in itself because it it it instills
3709420	3716860	it instills trouble if we are if we keep attentive to these difficulties
3718300	3723820	so that's the reason why i i don't meditate for algorithmic transparency for example which is
3724780	3731820	it's a complete stupidity from my perspective not only it's unattainable because the the
3731820	3739260	inductive logic is not even easily translatable into into a linear language understandable by
3739260	3752620	the humans but but it would be really attenuating the enchanting alien logic or the enchanting
3752620	3761980	view from somewhere else which we really need in order to to to boost our imagination also so i
3761980	3770940	think it it can if algorithmic systems can de-automatize our own thinking that would be
3771660	3778940	quite great okay in order to have some time for open discussion i will ask my last question
3778940	3783500	question which is always if you think about the future what makes you joyful
3784060	3791100	that's maybe the hardest one for the moment if i think about the future what makes me
3791100	3798540	joyful i think maybe but i'm not the the first one to say that uh that that impression that
3799900	3807420	the apocalypse has already arisen and that we are what remains i think slavosh dzek said that
3807420	3813100	and i find that a nice logic because you know if you think that the catastrophe the absolute
3813100	3821340	catastrophe has already arisen which is not impossible in fact then we have nothing left
3821340	3833820	to lose you know except that we we now have to organize ourselves to um to become to become
3833820	3843420	human to become human to to stop behaving like inhuman persons and there is much work i think
3844300	3852540	to attain to that non-inhumanity i prefer to speak of non-inhuman uh because it's less
3852540	3860860	segregative than affirming a human essence but i really like that double uh double negation i
3860860	3868220	think it's that double negations are are really uh are really interesting and really dialectical
3868220	3876620	and there may be the core of of of what makes us human that ability you know it's also zizek who
3876620	3885100	said that and i agree with him uh what you know what an artificial intelligence will never never
3885580	3892300	understand is the difference between uh coffee without cream and coffee without milk
3894060	3900220	but we can we understand there is a difference because we are affected differently by the lack
3900220	3907660	of cream or the lack of milk depending of our tastes um so that's what we have to preserve
3907660	3915980	i think and that's that's that's dialectic that's dialectics and i think uh well that's one thing
3915980	3923420	that makes me happy another thing that makes me happy uh or even joyful is are of course my my
3923420	3936060	kids whom i i find so so intelligent and so marvelous and yes that's it i guess
3937020	3940540	okay antonette thank you so much for being part of future histories
