00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

00:05.640 --> 00:09.000
Antoinette Rovois in today's episode.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.760
It's a Future Histories live episode that you are about to hear, meaning it has been

00:13.760 --> 00:19.680
recorded in front of an audience, in this case, in the context of the workshop Biological

00:19.680 --> 00:25.820
Life and Political Cybernetics that took place in December 22 in Vienna.

00:25.820 --> 00:32.460
And I want to thank the organizers Anna Verena-Nosthoff, Eugenia Stamboljeff and Vessel Reyes for

00:32.460 --> 00:36.640
the possibility to take part in this, it has been great, thanks a lot.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.140
And I am happy to announce that this is not a single workshop, but a series of workshops

00:42.140 --> 00:48.140
on the topic of political cybernetics and that I myself will organize an instance of

00:48.140 --> 00:54.620
this series at Kiel University as part of the research project Governing Algorithms.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.480
I'll definitely keep you updated on that.

00:58.480 --> 01:04.820
I also want to send a quick shout out to the Critical Data Lab, which I'm also affiliated

01:04.820 --> 01:11.560
to and which was, through Anna Verena-Nosthoff, also involved in the organization of the Political

01:11.560 --> 01:14.400
Cybernetics Workshop in Vienna.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.720
Many thanks to everybody involved in general, it has been a pleasure.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.480
Before we start, I would like to welcome Manchu and Dahlia as patrons of Future Histories

01:24.480 --> 01:30.240
and I want to thank Fabian, Lucas and Karl for their kind donations.

01:30.240 --> 01:37.240
And now, please enjoy today's episode with Antoinette Rovois on Algorithmic Governmentality.

01:42.740 --> 01:47.280
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

01:47.280 --> 01:50.340
Antoinette Rovois in today's episode.

01:50.340 --> 01:55.960
She is a permanent research associate at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research

01:55.960 --> 02:00.560
and a researcher and professor at the University of Namur in Belgium.

02:00.560 --> 02:06.360
Her work centers around evolving normativities at the interface of legal theory, philosophy

02:06.360 --> 02:12.280
and science and technology studies using, for course, insights on questions of government.

02:12.280 --> 02:17.060
She has developed an analytic framework called Algorithmic Governmentality, which we will

02:17.060 --> 02:19.420
explore in today's conversation.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.620
Welcome Antoinette.

02:20.620 --> 02:21.620
Thank you.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.620
Thank you for having me.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.120
It's a great pleasure.

02:24.120 --> 02:28.080
Let's maybe start with a broad definition for people who are not familiar with your

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
work.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.080
What is algorithmic governmentality?

02:30.080 --> 02:39.880
Well, I must first say that my intention with that concept or that notion or that non-concept

02:39.880 --> 02:46.540
rather of algorithmic governmentality has never been to find the right epochal ladder

02:46.540 --> 02:49.280
for something like a social totality.

02:49.280 --> 02:55.740
If I speak of governmentality, it is precisely in order to avoid delimiting the social as

02:55.740 --> 02:56.740
a totality.

02:56.740 --> 03:04.220
I don't speak of algorithmic society any more than of a surveillance society.

03:04.220 --> 03:09.840
Algorithmic governmentality does not, in the sense that I use the term, designate a particular

03:09.840 --> 03:16.580
mode of government which would have more or less replaced or been juxtaposited to the

03:16.640 --> 03:22.160
forms of sovereignty, pastorate, discipline, normalization, control and so on that Foucault

03:22.160 --> 03:26.920
and in fact, Foucault himself did not consider that sovereignty, surveillance, discipline,

03:26.920 --> 03:33.260
control and so on corresponded to a strict chronologic periodization.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.920
It was not for him a series in which the elements follow one another.

03:37.920 --> 03:44.660
It is rather a complex edifice in which the center of gravity shifts in the systems of

03:44.760 --> 03:51.440
correlations between legality, discipline, security, control and I would add with Felix

03:51.440 --> 04:00.240
Guattari integration and I would add with a lot of you, with most of you, recursivity.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.160
These shift at the core of governmental rationalities.

04:04.160 --> 04:11.460
The way I try to inherit of the non-concept of governmentality from Foucault is I must

04:11.460 --> 04:19.800
concede right away quite unfaithful, at least partially, to the original meaning ascribed

04:19.800 --> 04:25.760
to the term by Michel Foucault in the series of lectures he held at the CollÃ¨ge de France

04:25.760 --> 04:35.640
in 1978 and 1973 and I would say that because since I wrote about algorithmic governmentality

04:35.720 --> 04:44.520
first, it was a long, long time ago, my own thinking has evolved and I have come to understand

04:44.520 --> 04:51.620
that in fact algorithmic governmentality or algorithmic capitalism was not a mode of ordering

04:51.620 --> 04:52.620
of the world.

04:52.620 --> 05:01.580
It is not a mode of organization, but it's rather a tactic or a system of disorganization

05:01.620 --> 05:11.520
of organized and strategic disruption, which is highly profitable to the ones who Mackenzie

05:11.520 --> 05:14.520
work called the vectorialist class.

05:14.520 --> 05:23.080
But of course, we are all part of this and I will try to develop that a little bit later.

05:23.080 --> 05:31.720
So I refer to, also I must say right away that I refer to governmentality mainly as

05:31.720 --> 05:38.560
a methodological perspective that orients our attention away from the classical invariance

05:38.560 --> 05:44.020
of political science, the state, institutions, the subjects.

05:44.020 --> 05:50.100
From a governmentality perspective, the state, institutions, the subjects are not presupposed

05:50.180 --> 05:52.480
or pre-existent to governmentality.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.220
They are rather it's byproducts.

05:56.220 --> 06:08.380
So governmentality allows me to try to diagnose or to produce a kind of clinics or analytics

06:08.380 --> 06:15.140
of a series of semiotic, epistemic, normative, strategic, anthropological, ethical shifts

06:15.180 --> 06:21.600
in the processes or techniques of signification, that is production of meaning, in techniques

06:21.600 --> 06:25.940
of power or domination and in techniques of the self.

06:25.940 --> 06:33.020
Foucault's notion of governmentality or what he calls governmental rationality, which corresponds

06:33.020 --> 06:39.160
in this sense to what, for example, Castoriadis calls the imaginary institution of society

06:39.180 --> 06:48.200
is above all, for me, a way of making consistent, of articulating, of showing the entanglement

06:48.200 --> 06:55.840
in each era of a set of techniques of signification, meaning making, techniques of production,

06:55.840 --> 07:00.120
techniques of power and techniques of self.

07:00.120 --> 07:09.080
This being said, what I have as a target are indeed the new effects of reliability or credibility

07:10.000 --> 07:21.000
in the post-truth era where we are, as is often said, the unprecedented effects of power

07:21.000 --> 07:29.800
or operationality without authority, and therefore responsibility, or the force without law,

07:29.800 --> 07:36.680
and an individualization or molecularization and deterritorialization without subjects.

07:36.680 --> 07:43.040
Therefore, I speak with others of inhuman biopolitics, the instrumental unit of power

07:43.040 --> 07:52.800
being not anymore the population, individuals, or the bodies, but only meaningless data.

07:52.800 --> 07:59.520
So this being said about governmentality, now, why algorithmic governmentality?

07:59.520 --> 08:06.480
My algorithmic governmentality with my colleague Thomas Berns, we had in mind a kind of hypothesis

08:07.280 --> 08:13.320
a hypothesis of a government of the social world based on the algorithmic meaning automatic

08:13.320 --> 08:21.120
processing of the massive data proliferating from our behaviors by behaviors, I understand

08:21.120 --> 08:28.400
all the interactions we have with the environment, relationships, interactions, trajectories,

08:28.400 --> 08:29.740
and so on.

08:29.740 --> 08:37.620
So processing of massive data proliferating from our behaviors rather than on politics,

08:37.620 --> 08:42.860
law, social norms, in a multitude of sectors of activity and government.

08:42.860 --> 08:50.540
We therefore call algorithmic government or algorithmic governmentality a mode of government

08:50.540 --> 08:57.100
which is productive not of norms, neither of standards or rules, which in fact fails

08:57.180 --> 09:04.100
to adjudicate and which is fed essentially by raw data, by which I mean,

09:04.100 --> 09:09.500
intrapersonal and significant but quantifiable signals.

09:10.740 --> 09:17.380
Also, algorithmic governmentality operates by anticipatory configurations of possibilities

09:17.380 --> 09:25.620
through anticipatory optimization of environments rather than by regulation, permission, prohibition,

09:25.620 --> 09:26.340
and so on.

09:27.260 --> 09:36.060
But as I will tell, no, my current thought about it is rather that, in fact, it's not

09:36.060 --> 09:48.060
even trying to govern anything, it's rather trying to render power absolutely agile, able

09:48.060 --> 09:55.420
to be resilient to any kind of transformation, any kind of emergence.

09:55.420 --> 10:04.620
So that's really the speculative term that algorithmic governmentality marks.

10:06.540 --> 10:13.420
So we have also defined in some of our papers algorithmic governmentality very broadly

10:14.140 --> 10:21.660
as a certain type of normative or apolitical rationality founded or grounded on the automated

10:21.660 --> 10:27.740
collection, aggregation, and analysis of big data so as to model, anticipate, and

10:27.740 --> 10:30.700
preemptively affect possible behaviors.

10:32.140 --> 10:40.060
So, of course, when reading and rereading Foucault and Deleuze, I realized it was not

10:40.060 --> 10:42.140
very, very original.

10:42.140 --> 10:51.260
In fact, already in 1979, Foucault announced this on the horizon of liberal governmentality

10:51.980 --> 10:59.100
what appears is not at all the idea or the project of an exhaustively disciplinary society

10:59.100 --> 11:05.260
in which the legal network, enclosing individuals, would be related and extended from within

11:05.260 --> 11:10.860
by, let us say, normative mechanisms, nor is it a society in which the mechanisms of

11:10.860 --> 11:16.460
general normalization and exclusion of the non-normalizable would be required.

11:17.100 --> 11:23.420
On the contrary, on the horizon is the image or the idea or theme of a society in which

11:23.420 --> 11:28.700
there would be optimization of systems of difference, in which the field would be left open

11:28.700 --> 11:34.940
to auxiliary processes, in which there would be tolerance for minority individuals and

11:34.940 --> 11:39.900
practices, in which there would be action not on the players of the game but on the

11:39.900 --> 11:44.860
rules of the game, and finally, in which there would be intervention not on the type of

11:44.860 --> 11:51.740
internal subjugation of individuals but intervention of an environmental type.

11:53.420 --> 11:59.180
In the next lesson, Foucault reminded of the heterodox definition of economics given by

11:59.180 --> 12:07.020
Gary Baker, the science of systematicity of responses to environmental variations, a

12:07.020 --> 12:12.540
definition Foucault told us which can perfectly include the behavioral techniques that had been

12:12.540 --> 12:20.540
promoted in particular by Skinner about whom Foucault also writes that he was hostile to the

12:20.540 --> 12:27.580
use of statistics, that he considers that individual behaviors must be studied, which presupposes

12:27.580 --> 12:33.660
that we control the environment in which we place the subject and that we define measures

12:33.660 --> 12:41.420
of response which are informative. When a subject moves in his environment, some of his behaviors

12:41.420 --> 12:47.900
produce detectable changes in the environment, the reinforcement contingencies. The operant

12:47.900 --> 12:54.460
response is a class of responses defined by the consequences they have for the subject and issued

12:54.460 --> 12:59.660
in a given situation without being causally dependent on a stimulus in the situation.

12:59.660 --> 13:07.100
That's really the kind of data behaviorism that I have tried to describe, in which in fact

13:07.100 --> 13:13.340
insights replace knowledge and in fact it completely disturbs that the idea that

13:15.180 --> 13:22.540
Foucault had that in fact power is always based and co-produced with knowledge.

13:22.540 --> 13:28.780
Here the conjunction of knowledge and power is completely exploded. There is no need for

13:28.860 --> 13:37.260
knowledge to govern and it's even the opposite. It's a way through which contingency and

13:37.260 --> 13:47.980
non-knowledge and ignorance become the target of speculative and leveraging strategies.

13:47.980 --> 14:00.620
So we are not exactly in the situation described by Foucault. Why? Of course we perceive all that

14:00.620 --> 14:09.740
modulation that we have left modernist way of government and so on, but I would say we are

14:09.740 --> 14:19.660
even further than what he anticipated in 79. Why is it? Because in fact there is no action

14:19.660 --> 14:23.900
on the rules of the game or if there are actions on the rules of the game,

14:24.700 --> 14:32.940
these rules are not even any more detectable or subjectively recognizable by the players.

14:32.940 --> 14:40.060
Why is that? Because in algorithmic governmentality what we notice is that even

14:40.060 --> 14:48.300
metrics against which behaviors or performances are evaluated, ranked, scored and so on,

14:49.340 --> 14:55.740
metrics have become increasingly plastic. They are not fixed. They are not knowable in advance.

14:55.820 --> 15:04.780
They are moving and evolving according to the behaviors of all others. What that means is

15:04.780 --> 15:13.420
that we are not any more confronted with the kind of subject produced by algorithmic governmentality

15:13.420 --> 15:21.740
is completely at odds with the notion of the homo hemoconomicus described by Gary Becker,

15:22.220 --> 15:34.620
the homo economicus who had to invest rationally in his own human capital by being able to

15:34.620 --> 15:46.060
anticipate what kind of returns his investment would grant him. No, people never know how they

15:46.060 --> 15:56.380
will be evaluated and the metrics are so moving that in fact we can have the impression that this

15:56.380 --> 16:05.820
shift from modernist normativity towards recursive plasticity of abnormativity,

16:06.300 --> 16:18.060
that cybernetic mode of government, it can appear really emancipatory but it is paid,

16:18.860 --> 16:27.900
it is at the cost of transforming individuals into people who are completely addicted

16:27.900 --> 16:35.100
to credit so they have to find credit to gain attention, to gain audience, to be

16:35.100 --> 16:44.780
noticed, it means to occupy a node in the network. So in fact it's a kind of anomaly,

16:44.780 --> 16:54.380
that's the reason why in beginning to respond too long to your question, I said it's a system

16:54.380 --> 17:03.980
of disorganization. It's a system of disorganization because it fragments all subjectively and

17:03.980 --> 17:14.220
collectively recognizable forms into pure decontextualized signals which are re-aggregated

17:14.220 --> 17:23.580
at an industrial scale which is not personal nor collective nor nothing, which are pure speculative

17:23.580 --> 17:32.700
in which pure speculative spaces are created, speculative spaces of opportunities and risks.

17:34.060 --> 17:39.580
I have the impression that I have transformed this discussion into a monologue so don't

17:39.580 --> 17:48.380
hesitate to interrupt me if you wish. Well I'll just wait until you have finished making your

17:48.380 --> 17:56.300
point so that's all right with me. Okay so maybe in order to give some

17:56.300 --> 18:08.700
consistency, some materiality to what I'm saying here, I guess just a few examples.

18:09.340 --> 18:15.660
For example there is a new system of employee monitoring developed by Amazon in its warehouse

18:15.660 --> 18:23.020
and in the vehicle of their delivery drivers. In the online presentation Amazon presents the

18:23.020 --> 18:29.180
monitoring system as humanizing the interaction transportation companies have with their drivers

18:29.180 --> 18:37.020
to enhance driving performance. Indeed what matters in this humanization is to enable

18:37.020 --> 18:43.580
artificial intelligence systems to better understand or rather better act as if they

18:43.580 --> 18:50.380
understood the humans in their interactions with their environment. Of course what matters to

18:50.380 --> 18:56.620
Amazon is not at all understanding or legibility of each individual employee, their motivations,

18:56.620 --> 19:03.420
their intentions or the singularity of their experiences. In fact individual warehouse

19:03.420 --> 19:10.380
workers are eminently substituable or replaceable anyway. It is not their singularity that Amazon

19:10.380 --> 19:17.660
has an interest in nor is Amazon primarily interested in acquiring knowledge about the

19:17.660 --> 19:24.540
productivity of the workforce in general but rather it's interested in rendering individual

19:24.540 --> 19:30.940
workers every move computable in a data behaviorist paradigm. This is the kind of

19:30.940 --> 19:36.300
data behaviorism allowing humanization of interactions contemplated by Amazon.

19:37.980 --> 19:44.620
To humanize in this discourse means to scale power down to the molecular level,

19:45.100 --> 19:51.820
to leverage particularities not singularities but particularities. Conveniently from the

19:51.820 --> 19:59.900
perspective of a neoliberal management these particularities escape both subjective identification,

19:59.900 --> 20:03.420
recognition and collective perception and discussion.

20:05.820 --> 20:11.260
It is of course as I said not the singularity of individual experiences that are of interest to

20:11.260 --> 20:17.500
Amazon nor the regularities observed in the workforce population but rather the mostly

20:17.500 --> 20:24.060
subliminal particularities of behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. The individual and

20:24.060 --> 20:32.380
collective trade unionist and so on subjects how they may or may not acknowledge experiences

20:32.380 --> 20:39.820
their own and so on do not matter at all. They disappear from powers gaze. Singular and collective

20:39.820 --> 20:46.220
experiences drastically fall in value and power operates on the mode of machining enslavement

20:46.220 --> 20:54.220
rather than social subjection. So enabling everything to be connected to communicate

20:54.220 --> 21:01.660
or synchronize with everything else in almost real time the computational term appears to

21:01.660 --> 21:08.540
disqualify all kinds of representations including predictions based on statistical representations

21:08.540 --> 21:14.540
which never pretend to be adequate to the world but merely to provide approximative representations

21:14.540 --> 21:22.780
of it with an objective of neutrality. All these even statistical representations are felt as

21:22.780 --> 21:31.820
anarchisms sorry archaisms in favor of a post-representational recursive paradigm of

21:31.900 --> 21:39.100
disintermediated access to the digital real in high resolution which is also a high dissolution

21:39.660 --> 21:46.620
at the pre-semiotic stage emancipated from the symbolic order from the tyranny of the signifier

21:46.620 --> 21:55.740
from the imperialism of language itself. So and I will end maybe my attempt to

21:56.540 --> 22:00.860
to not define algorithmic or neutrality by this I would say that

22:02.940 --> 22:09.020
the aim but I will maybe later further explain this the aim is not so much to manage or influence

22:09.020 --> 22:15.500
the individuals and groups but to render power absolutely agile capable of leveraging the

22:15.500 --> 22:21.660
contingency of individual and collective behaviors whereas data drivenness attest to the replacement

22:21.660 --> 22:30.060
of both the commodity form and currency by assets all that matters is the convertibility

22:30.060 --> 22:37.820
of contingent data into speculative assets so the hallmark of power in algorithmic regime

22:37.820 --> 22:45.260
is not so much that it would look at us spy on us but rather that it literally bypass the visual

22:45.260 --> 22:53.100
epistem the phenomenological perceptual systems of recognition of qualification of judgment of

22:53.100 --> 22:59.420
categories in favors of systems of recursive computation as a consequence algorithmic

22:59.420 --> 23:05.260
governmentality is quite indifferent to what is present to what appears consistent and real to

23:05.260 --> 23:11.740
our ordinary senses as it shifts towards the forward-looking detection of contingent patterns

23:11.740 --> 23:18.540
as novel latent speculative spaces which are in no way subjectively or collectively recognizable

23:19.660 --> 23:30.300
so yes maybe I don't know if this fits as a broad indication of

23:31.180 --> 23:38.780
what algorithmic governmentality is about as a problem. Yes well let me jump in I would be

23:38.780 --> 23:45.180
interested at this point in in two things one would be that in one of your texts at some point

23:45.180 --> 23:51.660
you coming from this critique of algorithmic governmentality you continue to argue for a

23:51.660 --> 23:57.260
quote-unquote return to reality so I would be interested actually what you mean by reality in

23:57.260 --> 24:03.420
this case so what is it coming from this critique that you try to bring forward maybe as a I don't

24:03.420 --> 24:09.020
know how to call it then counter ontology I don't know maybe so maybe you could state what you mean

24:09.020 --> 24:13.980
with reality in this case this is one of the the questions that I have and the other one would be

24:13.980 --> 24:19.980
that when reading the texts from time to time I was asking myself whether or not these descriptions

24:19.980 --> 24:25.980
that you give of algorithmic governmentality I got the impression that they do absolutely fit

24:26.620 --> 24:33.740
for some form of imaginary of algorithmic governing but that if we look at the

24:34.620 --> 24:42.940
actual practice that this is not really an adequate description of how things are really

24:42.940 --> 24:50.380
going going down and one example for this would be this phrase of raw data is an oxymoron and you

24:50.380 --> 24:56.060
yourself state that the people who are actually working with these technologies are very much

24:56.060 --> 25:02.700
aware that there that there are so many hands reaching into the algorithm that there is always

25:02.700 --> 25:08.780
a co-production between the algorithm and the the humans who are working with it so that there is

25:08.780 --> 25:15.580
not actually this place of perfection that you kind of describe when talking about algorithmic

25:15.580 --> 25:21.980
governmentality who seems to be omnipotent when hearing about the critique and of course it's

25:21.980 --> 25:28.700
powerful but it's not omnipotent and it didn't yet succeed in getting rid of the human I would say so

25:28.700 --> 25:34.620
there is already this aspect of interpretation there's already this aspect of entanglement

25:34.620 --> 25:43.260
there's already this aspect of human co-production always in place already in capitalist cybernetics

25:43.260 --> 25:47.020
as well yes of course I hear what you say but I

25:49.260 --> 25:54.860
I think that that's the most maybe the most difficult thing to to to to transmit

25:56.940 --> 26:03.740
in fact what I say what I speak about what I speak about and I speak about it in my text as well

26:04.460 --> 26:11.260
it it's a technical ideology it's a technical ideology of big data it means that what I speak

26:11.260 --> 26:19.740
about is the kind of pretension but a pretension that even you know the designers of the of the

26:19.740 --> 26:27.980
technology data scientists and so on they they are not naive realists they they know they know that

26:27.980 --> 26:35.420
in fact big data doesn't mean exhaustivity that automatization or or algorithm don't

26:35.820 --> 26:45.420
mean doesn't mean objectivity that non-selectivity or less obvious selectivity

26:45.420 --> 26:54.140
doesn't mean impartiality and so on I think in fact and and that's the reason also why I

26:55.500 --> 27:04.300
I refer to problematization the basic question I ask to myself first is is why is you know the

27:05.420 --> 27:12.380
turning to algorithm and ambient intelligence artificial intelligence big data and so so on

27:12.380 --> 27:16.940
why are these solutions presented as solutions without

27:19.420 --> 27:26.380
and appearing as something absolutely obvious whereas they are presented by solution as solutions

27:26.380 --> 27:32.140
but the kind of problem to which they are presented as a solution against which which they are

27:32.140 --> 27:41.340
presented as solutions is never clearly stated and my my perception is that it is precisely

27:41.340 --> 27:54.780
because in our society we we have a hatred for averages we all want to be unique and recognized

27:54.780 --> 28:01.980
as unique we don't want to be part of a category anymore we want we all we all want personalization

28:01.980 --> 28:10.780
and so on means that in fact there is a radical crisis of representation and by this I mean

28:11.980 --> 28:17.820
not only the perception that all kinds of representations through which we perceive the

28:17.820 --> 28:25.580
world is misleading is ideological is is politically suspect and so on it's not that

28:26.540 --> 28:36.700
I think that there is behind this success of the algorithmic turn there is a kind of mystic

28:36.700 --> 28:44.140
a mystic of immanence a mystic or a belief that it is in it would be possible at last

28:44.860 --> 28:51.580
to touch rationally on the world and the things in themselves it is very close to the

28:51.740 --> 28:59.740
speculative turn and the speculative realism in philosophy that's the reason why I'm writing

28:59.740 --> 29:08.460
was about algorithmic realism but it's it's very it's of course absolutely absolutely

29:09.260 --> 29:19.180
ideological of course the human is everywhere the human is in the it's the human who who designs or

29:19.180 --> 29:26.940
who inscribes the the objective function the objective function of the algorithm

29:26.940 --> 29:36.380
what is it it is the it's the indication of or the cost function it indicates what has to be

29:36.380 --> 29:40.460
what has to be maximized what has to be minimized what has to be

29:40.940 --> 29:50.860
optimized of course that objective function is nothing but the the formalization of the

29:50.860 --> 29:58.140
sectoral sectorial interest or the sectorial logic of of the actor who's using the algorithm

29:58.140 --> 30:05.500
so there there is there is a human there there is the human of course in social reality itself

30:05.500 --> 30:09.420
and the mere fact the mere transcription of social reality of social

30:10.780 --> 30:17.260
into into digital data which appear as facts I speak of a new kind of facticity

30:17.260 --> 30:23.500
the simple transformation of reality of that reality social reality complex and so on into

30:24.140 --> 30:26.540
data doesn't purge doesn't

30:30.700 --> 30:38.300
expurgate that reality from all the domination the repose of domination relation over dominations

30:38.300 --> 30:45.420
and so on in fact as you say data raw data don't exist it it's not only that raw data is always

30:46.300 --> 30:49.500
of course it is it's a it's a patient work of

30:52.380 --> 30:59.980
of this indexization anonymization and so on producing raw data is a is a hard work

30:59.980 --> 31:09.500
but it's not it's not only that it's also that producing raw data is organizing the amnesia

31:09.500 --> 31:14.620
of data with regard to their the condition of their production that's the reason why it's

31:14.620 --> 31:20.540
I say it's a it's ideological it hides its own conditions of of production so

31:25.020 --> 31:32.860
so it's not that I in the question you you sent me I read that I don't only criticize the concept

31:32.860 --> 31:39.180
of a truth founded in probability I I never I I never criticized the concept of a truth

31:39.180 --> 31:45.100
founded in probability because following Foucault for me truth the notion of truth

31:46.060 --> 31:53.900
is always the result of truth regimes truth regime it's truth is always produced it's something that

31:53.900 --> 32:02.140
is added to the world it's nothing nothing that you can find in the world and that's the also you

32:02.140 --> 32:11.340
know the the false promise of of big data or the idea of the ideology of the technical ideology of

32:11.340 --> 32:19.260
big data is the idea that knowledge shouldn't have to be produced anymore that it can be discovered

32:19.260 --> 32:25.500
in the data that it's always already imminent in the data and provided you use the right algorithm

32:25.500 --> 32:34.380
you will you you you will find or knowledge will or truth will will arise spontaneously

32:35.340 --> 32:39.900
that's exactly that kind of naive realism that I'm combating

32:41.660 --> 32:47.820
the as as strongly as I can and you find that that same kind of naive realism

32:48.780 --> 32:58.780
in a lot of of techno-critics who really work on on the idea of rendering algorithms

32:59.340 --> 33:05.180
fair accountable transparent and so on meaning that they want to correct the algorithms with

33:05.180 --> 33:12.860
the idea of with the idea that if algorithms are fair are just are you know are accountable and so

33:12.860 --> 33:22.780
on then we will have a perfect access an objective access to what is you know without human

33:22.780 --> 33:32.060
intermediation that's that this that's really mad that's the madness because I think first of all

33:32.060 --> 33:37.580
there are several reasons of course the first obvious reason is that the notion of just the

33:37.580 --> 33:44.220
notions notions such as justice or concepts such as justice fairness and so on are dialectical

33:44.220 --> 33:51.580
concepts dialectical concepts are not easily formalizable into what george school nicolas

33:51.580 --> 34:01.020
george school again call uh uh uh arithmo uh arithmomorphic concepts arithmomorphic concepts

34:01.020 --> 34:08.620
in george school against uh uh uh civilization are concepts which are exactly what you know

34:08.620 --> 34:15.580
the result of an optimizations of an algorithmic optimization is you know just one result yes or

34:15.580 --> 34:22.460
not that's algorithm that's sure you know you don't have to discuss but justice is not something like

34:23.340 --> 34:30.140
it's really dialectical it means that it's it is a concept um which has a

34:31.180 --> 34:37.340
which is distinct of course but not discretizable not discretizable

34:38.620 --> 34:48.700
and that's that that's hugely important maybe i can yes i will read you i i had that um that

34:48.700 --> 34:55.580
passage of a george school george school again uh and for george school again the the the

34:55.580 --> 35:02.060
arithmomorphic character of a concept is linked to the fact that there is a definitive discrete

35:02.060 --> 35:08.780
border between what this and what is not what it is not what it is and what it is not the possibility

35:08.780 --> 35:15.340
of defining a big univocal relation between a set of concepts and a numerical scale makes it

35:15.340 --> 35:20.620
possible for example to attest to the arithmomorphic character of the concept in this set

35:22.460 --> 35:30.380
um but but there are another kind other another world of concept which are all the concepts that

35:30.380 --> 35:40.860
we we human use as we are uh uh because we are not inhuman and those not inhuman concepts are all

35:41.500 --> 35:53.420
are all uh dialectical i think so um so for for reality uh i think it was a misunderstanding

35:54.540 --> 36:01.900
there was a misunderstanding there uh if i the reality i i don't i don't remember having written

36:01.900 --> 36:07.900
that but uh if i help you for a return to reality the kind of reality i would like to return to

36:07.900 --> 36:18.300
is the reality that is added to the world added by our own collective productions of meaning so

36:18.300 --> 36:27.100
um that's the dialectical reality i i would uh i would argue for there are a series of conditions

36:27.100 --> 36:34.060
for this kind of additional uh additional uh reality to to occur

36:35.660 --> 36:43.740
and the first conditions are special and temporal we need scenes to discuss about

36:43.740 --> 36:51.900
dialectical concepts uh but maybe i go too too far in my answers i don't know if if it

36:52.540 --> 36:59.180
fits what you had in mind well if it was merely a misunderstanding you think then we could continue

36:59.740 --> 37:04.540
to other questions and i would just maybe to clear something up and since we are here on

37:04.540 --> 37:12.300
in the workshop on um cybernetic politics i just wanted to ask if i maybe understood it wrong

37:12.940 --> 37:19.180
right now in your answer when you pointed towards a kind of naive realism which is kind of close to

37:19.180 --> 37:25.260
speculative realism which you say is an kind of this naive realism is an aspect of algorithmic

37:25.260 --> 37:31.740
governmentality as well as of some of the critics i'm actually wondering because i always thought

37:31.740 --> 37:39.980
that cybernetics actually does not really care about ontology in this sense but is absolutely

37:39.980 --> 37:47.020
fine with something that would be called a probable truth so it's not about really kind of trying to

37:47.020 --> 37:54.140
unveil some kind of essence i always thought that this is absolutely not a logic found within the

37:54.140 --> 38:02.060
cybernetic paradigm but as i said instead it would totally be fine with a version that simply works

38:02.060 --> 38:08.060
or works better than the other one so this is what i meant with a truth founded in probability

38:08.060 --> 38:13.660
and i would say that this is really a fundamental difference so i was wondering if you think that

38:13.660 --> 38:19.820
algorithmic governmentality is in this respect different from cybernetics or why you say that

38:19.820 --> 38:26.540
they are trying to kind of get to the to the real because i always thought it's not about that

38:27.100 --> 38:33.820
no indeed it's not about that i think we have to understand quite clearly the epistemic ambition

38:33.820 --> 38:42.460
or strategic ambitions behind these machines as when they are used in a capitalist context

38:43.420 --> 38:49.020
of course in fact with the advent of big data and machine learning

38:50.380 --> 38:59.340
emergencies are detected in real time in a nanomic complex and purely metric digital space purely

38:59.340 --> 39:06.300
which is the result of an abstraction but also of all kinds of of production of raw data as you as

39:06.300 --> 39:15.100
you said which is compression and so on so but but which is purely metric which is a space which

39:15.100 --> 39:23.900
is envisaged that's not from the topological angle of continuity and stability but from the time

39:23.900 --> 39:32.700
based angle of contingency instability and continuously recons reconducted crisis

39:34.220 --> 39:42.060
as a host exo adams explaining one of his paper so in that context what we have to understand

39:42.700 --> 39:50.860
is that data doesn't don't function as as signs there they don't function as signifiers

39:51.660 --> 39:59.660
for for something rather they function as pure differences or deferments of meaning

40:00.300 --> 40:09.340
that are never given in their completion so to explain that a little bit i have i have to i think

40:09.340 --> 40:15.420
go back to a comparison between um what for example adolf ketley

40:16.140 --> 40:22.860
concept or the order between the deterministic metaphysics that for example adolf ketley

40:23.820 --> 40:30.540
heads when founding or participating to the to the foundation of statistics and what happens

40:32.540 --> 40:39.660
in machine learning the speculative ambitions of machine learning i think are really at odd

40:39.660 --> 40:46.460
with the mid 19th century of ambitions of studying studying social physics like adolf ketley

40:47.020 --> 40:53.100
whose project was to study men in his various degrees of aggregation from the individual state

40:53.100 --> 41:00.220
to the highest state of combination which includes the whole of humanity on the contrary algorithmic

41:00.220 --> 41:08.700
governmentality radically embraces uncertainty incommensurability contingency it it also attests

41:08.700 --> 41:15.980
to a new mode of preemptive intervention which is no longer legitimated or justified as the ability

41:15.980 --> 41:23.660
to act on the basis of precise knowledge of the future but on the contrary as an invincible

41:23.660 --> 41:32.300
certainty as to what must be done in the absence of such certainty as martin conings says quite

41:32.300 --> 41:37.740
clearly in capital and time so and the temporalities of course recursive which

41:37.740 --> 41:46.780
changed everything so um in fact it's a dynamic mode where continuous learning where continuous

41:46.780 --> 41:53.500
learning and production of reliability without truth including truth about people's behaviors

41:53.500 --> 41:59.740
replace the production of temporary truth and their justifiability verifiability contestability

42:00.620 --> 42:07.340
i would say what relates algorithmic governmentality also to cybernetic is of course the

42:07.340 --> 42:14.140
overcoming of the notion that that of the of the separation of calculation and things

42:14.140 --> 42:24.220
of of contents and matter and so on it resets a new kind new ontology but which is completely

42:24.940 --> 42:31.420
disarticulated from from the notion of of of a human subject

42:32.700 --> 42:39.260
so i don't know if it responds to you to your question i'm sure it does somehow definitely

42:39.260 --> 42:45.260
um i would be interested because i think you have described a lot of your critique already i would

42:45.260 --> 42:53.420
be interested in what you argue for actually so i would be interested in what is your proposition

42:53.420 --> 43:00.060
what would you bring in against algorithmic governmentality well um i i think of course

43:01.420 --> 43:10.220
my posture here is more descriptive of something uh which is uh which is which amounts to

43:10.220 --> 43:18.860
capitalism on capitalism and neoliberalism realism on algorithmic steroids i know it's

43:18.860 --> 43:27.020
not fashionable to say that uh but i think we would need uh maybe a constitutional moment

43:27.020 --> 43:34.940
a moment uh well a moment wherein we think about a concept what is a constitution a constitution

43:34.940 --> 43:43.100
is a text by which the present the people who are present and who sign the constitution limit

43:43.100 --> 43:49.100
their own power they limit their own power they promise a little bit like you know

43:50.620 --> 43:58.940
charged nature with that task of producing an animal who can promise and keep its promise

43:59.660 --> 44:07.420
constitution does that in fact it it forces those who sign to consider

44:08.380 --> 44:16.940
a lot of things which are irreducible to the mere optimization of the current situation or the state

44:16.940 --> 44:25.980
of state of facts uh it allow for the consideration uh a political constitution allow for the

44:25.980 --> 44:35.820
consideration of those who have not yet left any digital trace that can be enrolled in the calculation

44:36.380 --> 44:45.100
of the optimal it means that it allows to preserve the space and time which would not

44:45.100 --> 44:53.820
be preoccupied by the bulimic appetites by those who have been granted including by algorithmic

44:53.820 --> 45:00.380
algorithmic systems granted with the force without law which allows them to transform

45:01.100 --> 45:08.140
the virtual the not yet there the possibilities into into surplus value

45:09.180 --> 45:19.980
so it's it's uh i think we have to find ways to enforce uh new uh a new intelligence of

45:19.980 --> 45:28.140
limits a new intelligence of limits because uh this intelligence of limits which life itself

45:28.140 --> 45:37.980
has very well as a kangelem has shown us that normativity of life itself but we have to to

45:39.180 --> 45:45.100
to to find that there are several kinds of because i'm a lawyer by so i maybe i'm a bit

45:45.100 --> 45:52.860
distorted as all lawyers but i'm distorted uh uh and i try to go back to my own discipline you know

45:52.860 --> 46:01.580
as a as a safe island um but we have instruments uh the constitution we have the notion of

46:01.580 --> 46:07.340
institution what is an institution it's all that algorithmic governmentality tries to um

46:08.940 --> 46:16.940
to render obsolete in fact um the notion of according to david yume uh the role of institutions

46:16.940 --> 46:26.700
is in fact to force the agents you me uh elon musk uh donald trump everyone to force people

46:27.340 --> 46:36.300
to transcend the partiality of their natural sympathies you know um david yume was not for

46:36.300 --> 46:43.660
the social contract because he among other reasons he thought the problem of our society of society

46:43.660 --> 46:49.900
is not the egoism of individuals in fact people are not egoistic because they can sacrifice

46:49.900 --> 46:56.140
themselves for for the the ones they care for for their children and so on the problem is the

46:56.140 --> 47:05.340
partiality of these natural sympathies and only institutions can force people to refrain uh from

47:05.340 --> 47:12.860
their uh impulsion or compulsion to optimize that is to to to take the most they can of the present

47:12.860 --> 47:19.660
and of the future and of everything that is that is there and only only institution can force them

47:20.540 --> 47:27.340
to consider what is not already there for them to consume in fact so we we need that we need that

47:28.860 --> 47:34.140
no we need to rethink the role of kind of institutions and but fast because we don't

47:34.140 --> 47:45.660
have much time in front of systems in fact that push everyone uh towards self-optimization and

47:45.660 --> 47:51.020
consumption of of everything that's what i said at the beginning algorithmic

47:51.020 --> 47:56.860
governmentality is a way of fragmenting all collectives immunizing i would say capitalism

47:56.860 --> 48:06.060
against all and every form that should and and would in fact interrupt its flaws that is the

48:06.060 --> 48:16.780
world the material world and its limits the social the social the collective it fragments the

48:16.780 --> 48:25.020
collective it's a it's a high resolution which is also a high dissolution and life itself in fact

48:25.020 --> 48:34.060
life itself with with its own uh negantropic regulations that i i really believe that

48:34.060 --> 48:41.580
nick land was right when he said that there is a common teleology between cybernetics and capitalism

48:41.580 --> 48:49.180
and that terrible uh teleology is really necropolitic i believe so that that's the

48:49.180 --> 49:02.220
reason why we urgently need to reconcile with the notion that uh anyway we have to invent

49:02.220 --> 49:07.100
the forms including the political forms the institutional forms the constitutional forms

49:07.820 --> 49:14.540
which uh institute our life in common and alain supior had it right when he said the

49:14.540 --> 49:20.860
anthropologic function of law is to articulate together the different facets of human being

49:20.860 --> 49:30.300
these facets being the physiological the symbolic and the social if we agree to translate or to

49:30.300 --> 49:39.740
consider that all these different facets or layers are transcriber or reducible into

49:40.620 --> 49:49.340
reducible to pure flaws of of digital computable data and that this is enough for us to to to

49:50.220 --> 49:57.900
to govern ourselves i think we do a big mistake i think i would have to kind of dig a little

49:57.900 --> 50:06.220
deeper into this answer because um i guess it's not as simple as simply reverting back to like

50:06.220 --> 50:13.900
the law as it was the uh sovereign as it was the individual as it was so if we want to find

50:13.900 --> 50:20.060
answers to this as you frame it kind of assault of algorithmic governmentality then first of all we

50:20.060 --> 50:26.220
would have to ask are they the the proper tools in terms of are they adequate for the task and then

50:26.220 --> 50:31.180
of course i think we had we would have to rethink them because i mean they are not innocent in

50:31.180 --> 50:37.500
themselves the law is not innocent the the the liberal subject for sure is not innocent and so

50:37.500 --> 50:44.220
on so i would like to know at some point maybe this would be a good good example at some point

50:44.220 --> 50:52.220
you state that you think that actually we would have to stick with the fictional individual

50:52.220 --> 50:58.460
because it's kind of operationable it serves a purpose and that we need this purpose and

50:58.460 --> 51:03.580
while knowing that it is a fiction we still need it and i was wondering how far you would go with

51:03.580 --> 51:10.060
these things because i think it's kind of a play with fire but maybe positively speaking it's

51:10.060 --> 51:15.660
staying with the trouble in terms of done a hero way but i would be interested um whether or not

51:15.660 --> 51:20.620
we would have to kind of rethink these elements that you bring forward against algorithmic

51:20.620 --> 51:27.580
governmentality yes i think my response will be much simpler than your answer

51:28.300 --> 51:35.820
i'm afraid but i must state what's a subject for me what's the form subject for me the form subject

51:35.820 --> 51:45.260
is the content is void subjects are processes in constant overcoming of themselves subjects are

51:45.260 --> 51:51.340
becomeings there are processes of individuation processes of subjectivation and so on so

51:51.980 --> 51:59.020
notion of subject is eminently dynamic so i'm not nostalgic at all of the subject conceived as the

52:00.060 --> 52:06.540
as the liberalism conceived it as its fundamental unit unitary master of its own intentionality

52:07.180 --> 52:12.460
separated from others and so on not at all my notion of the subject is completely different and

52:12.460 --> 52:19.820
i have come to consider that the subject the role that the subject plays the subject is a point of

52:19.820 --> 52:26.860
view it's nothing else than a point of view so the world needs the subjects because the subject

52:26.860 --> 52:34.140
is the point of view from which objects may appear despite their ontological indetermination

52:34.780 --> 52:44.620
um as barad and so on uh would say and at the same time subjects need objects because also

52:44.620 --> 52:52.460
objects reflect their own position so it's a it's really a notion of the subject as um

52:53.980 --> 53:03.420
both as power subject as power of individuation or as a potentiality of individuation has never

53:03.420 --> 53:10.060
completely enclosed in any present but it's a process that is lived and experienced and

53:10.060 --> 53:15.980
constructed and deconstructed all the time over time over always over time so my notion of the

53:15.980 --> 53:25.020
subject is a heterochronic notion it's absolutely heterochronic that's the reason why uh the uh

53:25.740 --> 53:33.340
absorption in in the pure vortex of real time of everything by algorithmic governmentality

53:33.340 --> 53:41.180
is absolutely inhuman it's not habitable because we we are we are over time so that notion of the

53:41.180 --> 53:48.780
subject i think the subject like an actor it is because i'm a lawyer the notion of person persona

53:48.780 --> 53:57.660
person is the mask it's a mask that people put on their face when they have to act uh on a stage

53:57.660 --> 54:03.980
on a stage but also on the stage of the of the of a judicial court for example

54:04.940 --> 54:14.940
the notion the person is is inseparable from all the kinds of editorializations

54:15.580 --> 54:24.460
that we perform all the time but we are we are nothing else we are nothing else than these

54:24.460 --> 54:32.220
editorializations there is no subject without a form the form is the subject so that's the reason

54:32.220 --> 54:37.980
why the legal subject for example is is a functional fiction it's something that the law needs

54:38.860 --> 54:46.940
but it's but but the law knows that it's a fiction it's a place it's a location from which

54:47.500 --> 54:55.580
to make one's situation or the situation of the people who share an existential experience of

54:55.580 --> 55:04.860
discrimination for example together being a person before the law is being able to give account

55:05.900 --> 55:16.540
of injustice felt injustice felt problems to in fact it's a way of mattering and of determining

55:16.540 --> 55:24.780
or contributing to the definition of what matters what's a problem and what needs solution so it's

55:24.780 --> 55:34.380
quite pragmatic i would say but not only it's not only pragmatic i think it's also in a way ontologic

55:34.380 --> 55:40.700
but it's an ontology which is absolutely non-essentialist before asking my last

55:40.700 --> 55:46.860
question i would love to go to a place where we have been today in this workshop already

55:47.420 --> 55:51.980
i'm very much interested in this question of alternative arts of government and there's this

55:51.980 --> 55:59.340
famous quote by fukuh which i read out today earlier already and the quote goes what

55:59.340 --> 56:03.820
governmentality is possible as a strictly intrinsically and autonomously socialist

56:03.820 --> 56:10.220
governmentality in any case we know only that if there is a really socialist governmentality

56:10.220 --> 56:16.460
then it is not hidden within socialism and its texts it cannot be deduced from them it must be

56:16.460 --> 56:24.060
invented and quote and as i understand it your critique is a critique of algorithmic governmentality

56:24.060 --> 56:30.780
as a techno capitalist governmentality and not all of it will necessarily apply for other uses of

56:30.780 --> 56:37.180
these technologies in other contexts so maybe let's turn to the the question of construction again

56:37.180 --> 56:43.260
to the question of alternative in a positive sense what could this invention of desirable

56:43.260 --> 56:49.900
alternative governmentalities look like well i completely rejoined you when saying that you

56:49.900 --> 56:57.500
know and that's the the virtue of problematization is is to avoid technological determinism or you

56:57.500 --> 57:07.020
know today technologies are the ideal uh how you say scapegoat all the problems are

57:08.300 --> 57:15.340
we project all our problems on technologies it's because of of social networks that democracy is

57:15.340 --> 57:23.660
dysfunctional it's because of no no it's much broader than that uh of course so i i think

57:23.660 --> 57:31.900
there's no fatality in the fact that these uh technologies today are used in order to

57:31.900 --> 57:40.700
to boost uh capitalism and to accelerate uh to accelerate uh towards uh towards apocalysm

57:40.700 --> 57:47.180
apocalypse by apocalypse i mean precisely not the end of the world but the the end of the end of

57:47.260 --> 57:58.060
capitalism in fact um the smartness the smartness of these technologies is precisely

57:59.180 --> 58:06.700
that's uh through big data and machine learning we can become

58:08.940 --> 58:16.060
aware we can see regularities of the world which are only observable on on huge numbers

58:16.860 --> 58:23.660
so it's a question of scale so in fact what they produce also what they can produce are alternative

58:23.660 --> 58:32.060
maps of the world and of events which can be very interesting for i give you an example there are a

58:32.060 --> 58:40.780
lot of discussions today about the possibility the legitimacy or the opportunity of using

58:40.780 --> 58:49.740
algorithmic systems in in the judicial uh in the judicial system algorithmic decision making

58:50.620 --> 59:00.780
as to help judges for example and so on to take decisions um in fact what would be interesting

59:00.780 --> 59:08.540
what is interesting is that big data analytics allow for example to give to to to give to the

59:08.540 --> 59:16.140
judges a mirror of how the law functions you know it can give it can give very precious

59:16.140 --> 59:23.820
informations about the state of the law as it is practiced what kind of decisions are taken and so

59:23.820 --> 59:35.180
on so as a as a we can look at ourselves in big data and it gives us an image a certain image

59:35.180 --> 59:41.660
which is not deprived of a point of view because algorithms have point of view

59:42.380 --> 59:48.220
uh point the point of view of an algorithm i would say it's its objective function it depends of oh

59:48.220 --> 59:54.940
how the algorithm has been constructed and so on it depends on what kind of sensors are used to

59:54.940 --> 01:00:01.260
collect the data what kind of data are considered noise and what kind of data are considered signals

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:09.020
and so on so there are point of view but it can allow us to be uh alerted

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:17.020
about specificities or singularities of the world that we would not or of our

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:24.220
or of our own behaviors that we would not notice otherwise so it can increase our intelligence

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:33.100
instead of depriving us from intelligence the risk being of course that we overestimate the

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:42.300
objectivity the scientificity of these productions no they are not more scientific not more objective

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:48.700
than human judgment it's just that the world is looked at from a different perspective

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:54.780
when looked at from the perspective of an algorithm we have to know about all the

01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:01.420
biases the basis of the humans but the basis of the algorithms as well and there are a lot there

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:07.980
are a lot and and they're difficult to to detect sometimes because for example the distinction

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:14.860
between uh what is a signal and what is noise is not decided by an institution in algorithmic

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:26.220
governmentality it's it is just uh it is set it is that distinction is set in a in a way which is

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:34.860
undergenius to the the socio-mediatic reality so it's evolving all the time so it's quite

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:40.700
difficult to know exactly what the point of view of the algorithm is and that's the difficulty

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:48.300
that's the difficulty but that difficulty is quite interesting in itself because it it it instills

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:56.860
it instills trouble if we are if we keep attentive to these difficulties

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:03.820
so that's the reason why i i don't meditate for algorithmic transparency for example which is

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:11.820
it's a complete stupidity from my perspective not only it's unattainable because the the

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:19.260
inductive logic is not even easily translatable into into a linear language understandable by

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:32.620
the humans but but it would be really attenuating the enchanting alien logic or the enchanting

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:41.980
view from somewhere else which we really need in order to to to boost our imagination also so i

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:50.940
think it it can if algorithmic systems can de-automatize our own thinking that would be

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:58.940
quite great okay in order to have some time for open discussion i will ask my last question

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.500
question which is always if you think about the future what makes you joyful

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:11.100
that's maybe the hardest one for the moment if i think about the future what makes me

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:18.540
joyful i think maybe but i'm not the the first one to say that uh that that impression that

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:27.420
the apocalypse has already arisen and that we are what remains i think slavosh dzek said that

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:33.100
and i find that a nice logic because you know if you think that the catastrophe the absolute

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:41.340
catastrophe has already arisen which is not impossible in fact then we have nothing left

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:53.820
to lose you know except that we we now have to organize ourselves to um to become to become

01:03:53.820 --> 01:04:03.420
human to become human to to stop behaving like inhuman persons and there is much work i think

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:12.540
to attain to that non-inhumanity i prefer to speak of non-inhuman uh because it's less

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:20.860
segregative than affirming a human essence but i really like that double uh double negation i

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:28.220
think it's that double negations are are really uh are really interesting and really dialectical

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:36.620
and there may be the core of of of what makes us human that ability you know it's also zizek who

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:45.100
said that and i agree with him uh what you know what an artificial intelligence will never never

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:52.300
understand is the difference between uh coffee without cream and coffee without milk

01:04:54.060 --> 01:05:00.220
but we can we understand there is a difference because we are affected differently by the lack

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:07.660
of cream or the lack of milk depending of our tastes um so that's what we have to preserve

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:15.980
i think and that's that's that's dialectic that's dialectics and i think uh well that's one thing

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:23.420
that makes me happy another thing that makes me happy uh or even joyful is are of course my my

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:36.060
kids whom i i find so so intelligent and so marvelous and yes that's it i guess

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.540
