0	9760	It is absolutely incredible that economic concepts and tool sets are being implemented
9760	15840	deeply into computational processes and into network security processes.
15840	24320	I think this is actually quite a big deal, intellectually, technically, philosophically.
24320	25760	It is quite a big deal.
25760	31560	I first realized this when I went to a Bitcoin conference a while back and it was really
31560	32560	interesting.
32560	39200	I was like, wow, it's basically cryptographers that are discussing economics.
39200	40840	Cryptographers discussing economics.
40840	43800	That's a perfect start for today's episode.

107320	111960	Welcome to Future Histories.
111960	116560	My name is Jan Groß and my guest today is Dr. Jaya Clara Brecke.
116560	121680	She's a researcher investigating what matters politically in blockchain technology at Derham
121680	123120	University.
123120	124120	Welcome Jaya.
124120	125120	Hi.
125120	129720	I think most of my listeners will have heard of the term blockchain at some point, but
129720	134920	I think there's still actually considerable confusion and quite a lot of mysticism around
134920	136240	the technology.
136240	138120	So let's cover the basics first.
138120	141680	What is a blockchain and what types of blockchains are there?
141680	148360	Okay, so the way I tend to explain blockchain is I actually I go back to cryptography and
148360	153400	I go back to starting off with explaining what cryptographic hashing is for those who
153400	154640	are not familiar.
154640	159640	So essentially, you know, this is a mathematical process where you take some data, you put
159640	165080	it through this process and it spits out a string of numbers or a string of numbers and
165080	169200	letters, characters, whatever kind of hashing algorithm you're using.
169200	177000	And this has a very particular set of characteristics, which are extremely useful because only the
177000	181460	exact same data would spit out that particular string of numbers.
181460	186760	So what that means is that if anything in the data changes, you can detect that by running
186760	190320	the hashing algorithm again, and if it doesn't spit out the same number, then you know something
190320	191560	has been tampered with.
192520	198320	It's a very useful way of verifying the integrity of data.
198320	206480	So you add a timestamp to this and you string this together in a chain of hashed data.
206480	211560	And what you essentially potentially have is a linear history of, you know, things that
211560	216560	have changed over time or, you know, sets of data over time.
216560	221800	So that's essentially, you know, the kind of blockchain in terms of kind of data structure.
221800	225920	But then there is the question of how do you, if you want to have this taking place in a
225920	231300	decentralized network, how does the decentralized network come to an agreement around what data
231300	235400	should be added and hashed into this chain in the first place?
235400	240500	So how do we come to an agreement about what has happened, you know, in a given context?
240500	243560	In the case of Bitcoin, what has happened in terms of transactions?
243560	247160	In the case of Ethereum, what has happened in terms of computation?
247160	250080	But it could be any potential data.
250080	255320	So that consensus mechanism is what's called proof of work in Bitcoin and in many other
255320	256680	cryptocurrencies.
256680	258200	There are other consensus protocols.
258200	261120	I'm going to explain the one that Bitcoin uses.
261120	262520	That's the kind of starting point, let's say.
262520	264840	But you also have things like proof of stake.
264840	268040	You have things like proof of importance and proof of cooperation.
268160	274440	So the way the consensus protocol takes place in Bitcoin is the network competes on grouping
274440	281640	together the transactions into blocks and running it through a hashing process that
281640	286040	needs to spit out a number that meets certain requirements.
286040	289920	If it does not spit out that number meeting certain requirements, then they have not successfully
289920	290920	mined a block yet.
290920	292600	So they need to try again.
292600	297520	And by trying again, they basically just add a nonce, which is a random number to the data
298160	303960	until the random number that they add to the data affects the output string of number in
303960	308360	such a way so that it meets the requirements.
308360	315960	So what is it we have here is actually a quite profound shift in understanding around the
315960	322000	word consensus and an understanding around how a network reaches consensus.
322040	330040	Because if we think about this as a model for governance, this is a model for agreeing
330040	338240	about what actually happened, you have gone from previous models that could be a political
338240	342200	leader decides what's true or not, a judge decides what's true or not, a religious leader
342200	349920	decides what's true or not, or science or some kind of philosophical understanding of
349960	356920	truth of events and so on to a system which is essentially, you know, the way that it
356920	362400	decides what's happened, the way that it's decided what's true is through randomized
362400	370200	turns that is that is incentivized through rewards.
370200	377360	So you have a competition to be the one to define which transactions are considered valid
377360	381560	or what data is considered valid for that round.
381560	386480	So you have all these, you know, this whole network of computers that are taking turns
386480	393080	that are competing with each other to be the next intern to define the truth for that next
393080	394560	block.
394560	399160	That is essentially the kind of Bitcoin consensus protocol.
399160	405160	So blockchain technology did have very political goals from the start, and one of them actually
405160	409800	being the goal of overcoming politics altogether.
409800	416160	How did you approach the question of the political in your work on blockchain technology?
416160	421160	So first of all, it was really kind of working that out, you know, understanding, you know,
421160	430280	where what's really kind of the underlying ideas that gave rise to this technology.
431000	435400	And from that, I really, you know, I articulated this thing that actually, you know, what seems
435400	441840	to be happening here is an attempt at a kind of technical fix, a technical solution to
441840	443560	the problem of the political.
443560	451440	So if we understand the political as basically the negotiation of incompatible differences
451440	455880	through lots of different means, that would be one definition.
456240	461040	What you have here is a technology that tries to kind of resolve that in some kind of final
461040	462040	manner.
462040	466840	So, you know, you take the problem of power and authority that will be replaced by a decentralized
466840	467840	network.
467840	470720	So problem of authority has been solved.
470720	474600	The problem of consensus between, you know, incompatible positions, well, we've got an
474600	478680	algorithm that will do that and an algorithm that will do that in a way that's decentralized,
478680	484200	meaning no one can control it, which means that it can be considered somewhat, can be
484240	486880	considered neutral.
486880	491840	And then we have the problem of how to enforce that and secure the system.
491840	498240	And, you know, code will enforce it and cryptography will secure the system from any kind of
498240	500520	attacks or manipulation.
500520	505240	So the idea is like these components somehow resolve the problem of the political in some
505240	507560	kind of final way.
507560	512800	So a lot of my work, I guess, was partially kind of untangling where do these ideas come
512800	520960	from and how are they sought to be kind of like written and encoded and what's that
520960	526040	process, what has that process looked like?
526040	533000	And also to look at kind of, you know, there's lots of different theories around like understanding
533000	534360	the politics of technology.
534360	538920	One of them is, you know, really understands the political as something that then gets
539000	544360	inscribed into a piece of technology or an infrastructure so that a certain kind of politics
544360	550440	or ethics will be operating in a kind of imminent manner.
550440	556920	So, you know, say, for example, for me, like a really good example is the door closer that
556920	561160	I think Bruno Latour uses and is, you know, one kind of easy way of understanding this
561160	566280	principle, which is basically like a door closer will automatically close the door and
566280	571920	that enforces a certain kind of understanding that the door being closed is good, whereas
571920	574340	the door remaining open is bad.
574340	578920	So therefore we have this door closer that's now going to continue to enforce that regardless
578920	583000	of what we feel about it or not.
583000	588760	Of course, the door closer is radically different from a complex network because the door closer,
588760	593760	if you disagree with it, you just kind of like put something to block it from working
593840	599040	or you pick it apart or whatever else, it's quite easy to change those conditions.
599040	604200	And it's also quite easy to see what exactly is enforcing those conditions, where in complex
604200	610320	network technology, sometimes it's pretty hard to understand where and why something
610320	614720	turns out the way it turns out and how to fix that.
614720	619600	And it requires certain skills to understand that and requires certain skills to tinker
619600	621440	with it.
621440	627960	Of course, in blockchain and in the kind of open source movement, that problem is attempted
627960	632280	to be addressed by actually making things open source and trying to kind of explain
632280	635320	systems and involve people in a variety of ways.
635320	640880	And that's like a very positive side of the culture.
640880	642840	But I think I lost my thread there a little bit.
642840	645360	I don't mind.
645360	651080	It's good because you pointed towards you looking at the history of network cultures
651080	657560	actually in order to understand how this, you call it blockchain sensibility, got formed
657560	660080	the way it is.
660080	665840	And I think you did a very good job in pointing out that we should definitely take a second
665840	673840	look and that both the evangelists, like the blockchain evangelists, should get away from
673840	676320	easy dichotomies, but also the critics.
676320	677320	Yeah.
677320	682600	I mean, so because what I was observing was obviously, you know, the people that are attracted
682600	686040	to blockchain come from a variety of different backgrounds.
686040	691200	I mean, it's really attracted a lot of people from across different political spectrums
691200	695920	and across different kinds of political cultures and histories.
695920	700940	And so to me, it just seemed like, you know, although I think like some of the criticisms
701100	708340	that have come, that does analyze, you know, especially things like Bitcoin and so on as,
708340	715180	you know, a kind of right wing capitalist kind of project or a narco capitalist project,
715180	718660	you know, sure, there's certain truth to that, but it just didn't seem to be telling the
718660	719660	entire story.
719660	727140	And it was telling a very kind of US centric history of blockchain to analyze it just on
727140	728140	those terms.
728140	730820	And I was trying to understand what else was going on or what was missing from that
730820	735980	picture because I was observing people really from lots of different political backgrounds
735980	738700	getting involved.
738700	742420	And so for me, it was more interesting to look at the kind of like history of decentralization
742420	748460	and peer to peer and look at some of the kind of practical problems that different technologies
748460	750500	have been trying to solve.
750500	754940	And one of them, I mean, really, you know, like the kind of history of peer to peer in
754980	759460	terms of network cultures really has been about authority and it really has been about
759460	765580	how can we create networks that even if like one person gets arrested or one server gets
765580	772340	taken down, the network itself can still continue to function and can still continue to operate.
772340	779060	And these were kind of pragmatic problems, you know, that the piracy movement or anti
779500	781860	copyright movement has been dealing with.
781860	786260	You know, these are problems that like, you know, different kind of, you know, indie media
786260	789260	type projects have been dealing with.
789260	794660	You know, it's really this question of, or this, let's say, using decentralization as
794660	798940	a way to circumvent authorities, you know.
798940	804700	So but what for me was interesting was some things have changed from the early history
804700	810940	of peer to peer to, you know, where we're now at with blockchain technology.
810940	815580	And a lot of that has to do with kind of like a shift in understanding where instead of
815580	822580	using peer to peer or decentralization as a kind of specific strategy for specific political
823700	830060	projects or purposes, it becomes a kind of abstract political aim in itself.
830060	835100	And that's where I think like this idea or this kind of illusion of like having resolved
835100	839940	the problem of the political in some kind of final manner comes about, right.
839940	845980	And it's also where, to be honest, I think like, you know, by abstracting these things,
845980	852980	that's why you see something like Ethereum being able to appeal to, you know, financial
852980	858980	industries plus governments plus activists plus, you know, pretty much anybody or anything
859100	864100	because this thing has been taken out of it, right.
864100	868540	It becomes this kind of like generalized abstract thing where there's no, yeah, the kind of
868540	872640	political project is abstracted, let's say.
872640	876940	So everyone can see a certain kind of way of potentially using these technologies for
876940	880980	some efficiency gains or whatever else.
880980	887980	But for me, yeah, for me, there's like something strange that happens with that abstraction
889060	896060	where kind of grounded understanding of what's in operation with the technology is lost.
896980	901300	And I'm trying to, so what I'm trying to do in the thesis is give, you know, some access
901300	903820	points to that.
903820	910820	And actually, it feels as if a specific type of looking at the world is actually generalized.
912540	918540	And when I was reading your thesis, I had to think about like how it reminded me of
918740	925740	how game theory was invented in the sociopolitical arena of Cold War politics in a very specific
928660	930860	context.
930860	937860	And then it kind of got generalized as well, kind of similar to the way that Ethereum kind
939580	946580	of set the scene to generalize this very specific understanding that comes out of like decentralized
947580	951420	security modeling, actually.
951420	958420	And I was wondering, because I mean, that might be unfair again, you know, but kind
958540	965540	of it felt as if the same type of paranoia-ish looking on the world is generalized in game
969380	970980	theory in the first place.
970980	977980	And then a technology like Ethereum comes along and kind of builds and technological
977980	983980	infrastructure to generalize it in technical terms as well.
983980	987540	Yeah, absolutely. And it's, you know, there's a whole set of kind of strange contradictions
987540	988340	at play here.
988340	994300	So you're right. I mean, what I'm tracing in my PhD also is like the set of problems
994300	1001300	that come about when you create a decentralized network, the set of technical problems, which,
1001500	1008500	you know, in terms of network security is this issue that, you know, in a truly decentralized
1009820	1015620	network, anyone can potentially be an adversary, right?
1015620	1021400	And so, you know, a lot of that idea of like how do you secure against the fact that anyone
1021400	1026080	can potentially be an adversary does feed into the kind of like general understanding
1026080	1033080	of the world really is like, you know, trying to eliminate trust, you know, trying to solve
1033080	1038360	the trust problem, which is like, you know, how big or how blockchain tends to be understood
1038360	1039800	these days.
1039800	1046800	But it's like very fuzzy, the exact limits to where things are being solved or what's
1047400	1053040	being solved here exactly, because in each and every moment, there is so much trust involved.
1053040	1056760	You know, you've got to, you know, there's no one that has actually gone through and
1056760	1063020	audited every single piece of code or understood every single piece of, you know, cryptographic
1063020	1068220	hashing algorithm that's being used and verified themselves as a single individual.
1068220	1074440	You know, there are obviously communities of trust in a real sense, even in blockchain
1074440	1078120	technologies in so-called, you know, trustless networks.
1078120	1084720	So like, yeah, there is this kind of imagination or this ideal that like ultimate, you know,
1084720	1091480	the ultimate system is a system where nobody needs to be trusted.
1091480	1098760	And that's kind of necessary to reach this ideal of a secure decentralized system replacing
1098760	1100880	authorities.
1100880	1104760	But in actual fact, the way it plays out doesn't quite look that way.
1104760	1112000	It just, there's a kind of reconfiguration of how trust operates.
1112000	1115160	There was something else I wanted to say on that, but it slipped my mind now.
1115160	1117120	I'm sure it'll come up in a different form.
1117120	1123800	Well, yeah, and I think I'll have a good point to get into it, because you describe four
1123800	1130640	principles of blockchain technology and afterwards you have a short paragraph where you let the
1130640	1136760	reader know how different the way the terms are being used actually is.
1136760	1142040	I mean, you just said it in relation to trust, but actually it's in relation to decentralization
1142040	1144040	as well and consensus and stuff.
1144040	1150720	So could you maybe explain the four principles and how the way these terms are being used
1150720	1157120	is actually quite counterintuitive to the way we use it in like everyday language?
1157120	1158120	Yeah.
1158720	1165320	Yeah, so I guess, so what I'm saying in this section is trying to kind of compare, like
1165320	1176200	you say, how we understand some of these terms, trust, openness, decentralization, and immutability
1176200	1184080	quite differently in our social lives than what becomes technically articulated and how
1184160	1188680	that technical articulation then becomes a kind of certain view of the world or a certain
1188680	1192360	kind of understanding of the world.
1192360	1198000	So generally speaking in social life, more trust is a good thing, right?
1198000	1205640	If we create kind of more trust between us, that's a good thing.
1205640	1213040	Whereas in kind of blockchain, trust is considered something that needs to be eliminated entirely.
1213440	1219080	In some ways, there's some interesting dynamics that I don't think I go into so much in this
1219080	1230760	paragraph about that, but about how that's in many ways a kind of feature of lots of
1230760	1236840	different aspects of technology and scientific devices in general, that we trust the observation
1237640	1244480	of a measuring device more than we would trust someone's account of it.
1244480	1249800	So take like temperature measurements, for example, it's like someone's like, oh, this
1249800	1254840	feels really, really hot, and it's like, no, the thermometer says it's only 20 degrees
1254840	1260520	outside or things like this where there's like a certain kind of, we assign a certain
1260600	1269640	kind of validity to the return of certain kinds of technical instruments and apparatuses
1269640	1275000	more so than our kind of common experiences.
1275000	1278560	I mean, that's not to pit the kind of human against the machine in any kind of way.
1278560	1284280	It's just an observation about how devices and apparatuses sometimes operate.
1284280	1290160	And I say it only because it's such a major, major part of the political proposition of
1290160	1300360	blockchain to create a kind of governance apparatus, essentially, that is somehow constructed
1300360	1304040	by a set of elements that are beyond the control of human beings.
1304040	1306160	And that's like the explicit aim.
1306160	1311320	That's the kind of that's the political aim of the project, really.
1311320	1312600	So let's go into that.
1312600	1316940	What's the role of algorithmic governance in blockchain technology?
1316940	1324060	So what is the narrative around it and what are the narratives of future that are connected
1324060	1325060	to it?
1325060	1334980	Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand entirely the question, if you can make it more specific.
1334980	1342340	Well, you kind of said right now that one of the main purposes of blockchain technology
1342340	1355380	is being a technology for governance purposes in order to provide a different way to actually
1355380	1357940	organize society as a whole, you know?
1357940	1365260	And so there's a narrative, a political narrative connected to this technology that is tightly
1365260	1369740	coupled to the idea of algorithmic governance.
1369740	1370820	What's the idea behind it?
1370820	1376300	How do they want to use algorithmic governance to reorganize society?
1376300	1382820	Yeah, I mean, so, you know, one point that I've been making a lot throughout my thesis
1382820	1387540	in the kind of not just in the written piece, but also in the talks that I've been giving
1387540	1394860	and so on, is this kind of irony or this kind of this observation that like peer-to-peer
1394860	1400320	technology, you know, there's a lot of focus on this ambition of disintermediation, right?
1400320	1406680	To get rid of the kind of intermediary, the middleman, so that we can have kind of direct
1406680	1409040	relations with one another.
1409040	1412520	And so for transactions, that would be like, let's get rid of the banks and the governments
1412520	1417880	so that we can just exchange value directly between each other without anyone, you know,
1417880	1423880	either controlling whether we can do that or not, or like the surveillance and gathering
1423880	1427840	information about us and our transactions.
1427840	1432120	And so there's like this focus on disintermediation and getting rid of the middleman.
1432120	1436360	But then on this kind of like political ambition, I mean, you look at this thing and it's like
1436360	1441200	the most incredible, like the most intense form of intermediation you can imagine when
1441200	1443760	it comes to questions of governance, right?
1443760	1451120	We're bringing together like, you know, networks and algorithms and protocols and game theory
1451120	1456160	and market dynamics and you name it, all into this kind of like some kind of apparatus that
1456240	1464200	is supposed to kind of sit between all of us and enforce some kind of consensus between
1464200	1465720	all of us.
1465720	1473000	So it's this very intense form of intermediation, actually, and a hugely complex form of intermediation.
1473000	1481880	Yeah, so on the question of algorithmic governance, it's so, I mean, with blockchain, I think
1481920	1487720	I mentioned already in the definition how, you know, the technology looks to solve the
1487720	1489960	problem of the political.
1489960	1494280	And so you have, you know, something like, you know, you have consensus algorithms that
1494280	1497560	organize consensus amongst nodes in the network.
1497560	1504720	But also, you've got things like decentralized autonomous organizations, you've got things
1504720	1507360	like smart contracts.
1507360	1516480	So ways of trying to kind of automate certain aspects of governance and contractual relationships,
1516480	1521440	let's say, so that they once again cannot be controlled by any single individual, but
1521440	1526520	that run, you know, across a kind of decentralized network.
1526520	1530880	And there's lots of kind of directions that people imagine this going in.
1530960	1538120	And so, you know, the kind of like fantasy, which is both the kind of like dystopian fantasy,
1538120	1541680	but also something that you see people in the blockchain space talk about with like
1541680	1547240	really kind of like feverish bright eyes is this, you know, this combination of blockchain
1547240	1553520	with AI, you know, that, you know, will have, you know, AI emerge, which will be this kind
1553520	1565600	of like, yeah, perfect, scary, non-human, but amazingly mathematical intelligence that
1565600	1574720	will use the kind of power of cryptography and the kind of uncontrollable, uncontrollability,
1574720	1580680	unstoppable ability of smart contracts to basically run the world.
1580840	1587600	And specifically in terms of this narrative for future, there has been some setbacks to
1587600	1589560	say it mildly.
1589560	1596800	So there was a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, as you mentioned, in Ethereum,
1596800	1598480	on the Ethereum blockchain.
1598480	1600880	And there was a lot of hype around it.
1600880	1604280	And at some point it got hacked.
1604280	1612000	And actually, what followed then was some kind of reflection about the limits of this
1612000	1613840	kind of thinking.
1613840	1622400	And for some, it was like a, I think it was just the lesson that we just didn't do it
1622400	1623400	good enough yet.
1623400	1624400	Yeah.
1624400	1629640	And for others, they thought, all right, well, this showed us actually that it's not just
1629640	1636240	a deterministic world we're living in that can be handled in this kind of way, but there
1636240	1642240	are different aspects, like social aspects and stuff that have to be considered in this
1642240	1643240	kind of thing.
1643240	1644240	Yeah.
1644240	1645240	Yeah.
1645240	1648080	So I write quite a bit about that event in my thesis also.
1648080	1657520	I mean, the problem is, so, you know, the story of blockchain and what it can do and
1657520	1663760	the story of blockchain plus AI, you know, these things, they sound so convincing.
1663760	1667400	But one of the main reasons why they're so convincing is because when you kind of, when
1667400	1671600	you look at the story, you're looking only at the story and you forget to look at everything
1671600	1676560	outside of it, when actually everything outside of it really matters for how that story will
1676560	1678720	play out in reality.
1678720	1686300	And to take a very basic example, this idea of a kind of, you know, blockchain system
1686540	1693740	that runs entirely without authorities, you know, at some point, someone had to write
1693740	1696740	that protocol, right?
1696740	1702340	And so that someone, you know, or those groups of people, in essence, have then written the
1702340	1705340	rules of society, right?
1705340	1709100	If indeed this thing was going to continue to run without it being controlled or without
1709100	1713180	it being kind of modified and so on.
1713180	1719100	But also what happens is in reality, not only has someone or people writing protocols,
1719100	1723740	but also the protocols need to be maintained and updated and things break and nothing is
1723740	1725140	ever written perfectly.
1725140	1733100	And, you know, so there is this kind of like real kind of difference or real gap between
1733100	1743180	the kind of the perfect ideal that somehow kind of, you know, mathematics, cryptography
1743180	1747300	and technical systems, you know, they give us this kind of mental image of something
1747300	1753740	that is perfectly neatly organized, perfectly rational and perfectly objective, when in
1753740	1757740	actual fact, like that's a kind of it's a mental image of it.
1757740	1761900	Whenever people actually write these things down, obviously, like it exists as part of
1761900	1768580	a kind of far more complex world where lots of other dynamics play into how a system
1768580	1772300	will actually operate and the actual effects of a system.
1772300	1778780	And so what happened in the DAO attack was, you know, there was this decentralized autonomous
1778780	1784620	organization and it was supposed to be governed purely and only by the rules written in its
1784620	1787380	smart contract.
1787380	1791860	And this smart contract lived in a decentralized network and no one was supposed to be able
1791860	1796700	to modify it or change it after it had been deployed.
1796700	1802700	So it was deployed and lots of people invested in the decentralized autonomous organization,
1802700	1804700	I think up to 60 million dollars.
1804700	1806540	No, more than that.
1806540	1809580	I think over 100 million dollars.
1809580	1817380	And then all of a sudden people saw that there was an amount of investment that was being
1817700	1822540	taken out of the DAO contract repeatedly.
1822540	1828980	And so it turned out that in the contract code, this was possible through a kind of
1828980	1833980	combination of a couple of different rules that had been specified in the contract.
1833980	1840380	And someone was literally emptying the fund and got away with about 60 million dollars.
1840380	1846040	And the reactions to that were, you know, kind of split the community.
1846040	1853720	So some people felt like, you know, this needed to be stopped.
1853720	1855680	This should never have happened.
1855680	1857520	We should intervene.
1857520	1862760	And another set of people were like, no, because the rules said that only the smart contracts
1862760	1863800	governs this thing.
1863800	1867520	And so therefore, if what's written in the smart contract is the only thing that governs
1867520	1873400	it and it allows for this person to actually or this hacker to actually siphon off this
1873520	1876880	money, that should be allowed to go ahead.
1876880	1883760	And so what you saw was, you know, the Ethereum Foundation got quite concerned and got involved
1883760	1891680	because this was a considerable amount of the actual total amount of ether in the market.
1891680	1898200	And so they decided to go in and intervene and basically do what's called, I guess you
1898280	1907680	could call it a kind of rollback on the Ethereum blockchain and fork the blockchain so that
1907680	1912320	before the hack attacked and kind of pretend that in the history of the Ethereum blockchain,
1912320	1920200	this hack had never actually happened to then buy time to go in and retrieve the funds.
1920200	1925760	And that's like a clear act of a kind of outside authority in a sense, right?
1925760	1929080	And so there was a lot of like soul searching in the community about whether or not that
1929080	1935760	was a good thing or not, whether that should be possible at all.
1935760	1937520	And it did split the community.
1937520	1941800	And so you have two different versions of Ethereum running now, one that has a history
1941800	1946200	of events where this hack never happened, and one that has a history of events where
1946200	1949120	it did happen.
1949760	1959000	And so for some people in the Ethereum community, the way of making sense of this in terms of
1959000	1966680	decentralization and so on, was to say that social consensus trumps computational consensus.
1966680	1974480	So this idea that like it was actually okay for the Ethereum Foundation to step in and
1974480	1979480	retrieve the funds by forking the chain because there was agreement, there was broad agreement
1979480	1982760	in the community that that was what needed to be done.
1982760	1994480	And that agreement was expressed through the adoption of nodes in the network of this new
1994480	1997000	version of the Ethereum blockchain.
1997000	2001240	So in many ways, you could say there was a decentralized consensus around moving forward
2001240	2009040	on that decision, although there was a kind of another splinter group that disagreed.
2009040	2011200	So there's lots of stuff going on here.
2011200	2020440	But what I think really kind of was very nicely kind of demonstrated to the community was
2020440	2028680	that you don't get rid of the complexity of the world, you don't get rid of human beings,
2028680	2030720	you don't get rid of all these things so easily.
2030720	2035680	And they actually play a pretty important role for how systems play out.
2035680	2043480	Like there's no there's no final guarantee against like against the indeterminate reality
2043480	2047720	that we live in, you know, things kind of unfold.
2047720	2052000	I mean, yeah, there's there's so many ways of kind of saying this.
2053000	2060120	And I keep saying it that, you know, this idea of a kind of final solution to the problem
2060120	2064200	of the political, it's I mean, it's cute.
2064200	2067480	And I understand where it's coming from.
2067480	2070040	But really, you know, cryptography doesn't do that.
2070040	2071320	There is nothing that does that.
2071320	2072960	I mean, time keeps passing.
2072960	2077760	And between us, there's just too many, there's there's too many unknowns in the universe.
2077800	2082720	It's like it's a radically open future, you know, and you take something like cryptography
2082720	2089840	that is that is really, let's say, the the cornerstone of this political or this kind
2089840	2098000	of belief system in blockchain, this idea of like the, you know, the security of cryptography
2098000	2104760	being like something fixed and something something determined, you know, that we can somehow
2104800	2110920	build everything else on top of, you know, I went to I went to Bletchley Park the other
2110920	2117400	day, which is I don't know if people know what that is, but it's it's where Alan Turing
2117400	2122440	and a bunch of other English mathematicians got together during the Second World War to
2122440	2127440	break the Lorenz, the German Lorenz cipher machine.
2127440	2132520	And a few of them did and invented the Colossus in order to do that.
2132520	2137800	And it's you know, it's a very good it's a very kind of historical reminder and an epic
2137800	2143520	reminder of the fact that cryptography, you know, is is never final.
2143520	2149640	You know, it can be broken and and it is repeatedly broken and it's an ongoing process.
2149640	2155040	Cryptography is very interesting to use in different kinds of systems design because,
2155040	2161360	yes, it does buy you time and it has some incredible properties, but but it doesn't
2161360	2164360	resolve things in any final in any final way.
2164360	2166560	It's not bulletproof.
2166560	2173440	It's just another device that we humans have invented in our engagement with with the kind
2173440	2177520	of elements of the universe that we live in, you know, with the mathematics that we that
2177520	2181320	we've kind of developed. Yeah.
2181320	2183520	That was a lot.
2184240	2192720	That's good. And actually, there's a there's another element that kind of undermines this
2192720	2196840	perception of blockchain technology being a truth machine.
2196840	2203800	In your thesis, there's a part where you describe this actually quite fitting.
2203800	2204800	I'll just quote it.
2204800	2209440	Actually, I think if we take a closer look at how double spending is solved and how consensus
2209440	2214520	is arrived at in decentralized networks, there is, in fact, no need to determine which
2214520	2219600	of the conflicting transactions is true because from the perspective of the system, it does
2219600	2223640	not matter which is verified as long as it is just one of them.
2223640	2227080	What is true or really happened is not of importance.
2227080	2228080	End quote.
2228080	2233200	So I really like that because the consensus this means that means that the consensus in
2233240	2239840	blockchain is actually far from being any kind of objective truth, but it is what you
2239840	2243480	later call an incentive driven settlement.
2243480	2250960	And I think this is very spot on because it kind of begs the question, how does this affect
2250960	2254520	the the the kinds of truths?
2254520	2256080	Is that the plural of truth?
2256080	2262200	I don't know the truths that that can be produced because I'm actually like one hundred percent
2262240	2270080	sure that there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many truths that cannot be produced
2270080	2272680	with this specific type of thinking.
2272680	2273680	Yeah.
2275800	2281680	Yeah, it's another kind of like cute.
2284480	2290840	I say cute because it's another kind of cute approach to some of the kind of deep complex
2290840	2292160	problems of the political.
2294440	2299560	And I say cute because it's a kind of backing down of or a kind of historical accumulation
2299560	2301920	of disappointments in authorities.
2301920	2308480	So it feels a little bit like this child that who's who realizes that its parents are
2309480	2314320	fallible, you know, and goes looking for something that isn't fallible.
2314320	2320840	And so, you know, and the reason why I say that is because, like, OK, so, I don't know,
2320840	2326200	to me, it does seem like, you know, it's trying to instead of instead of instead of trying
2326200	2332840	to ponder what truths might be out there and try and work through that in all the kind
2332840	2337280	of philosophical implications and all the social implications and through all the kind
2337280	2342240	of historical pain and so on that has that has happened in this pursuit of truth.
2342240	2343880	And here I'm talking about religion.
2343880	2347640	I'm talking about political ideologies.
2347640	2353920	I'm talking about geopolitics, you know, and and historical events.
2355240	2362480	This is the kind of idea that, like, we don't need a universal truth coming stemming from
2362480	2363840	kind of human reflection.
2364480	2369800	All we need is something that ensures that who gets to determine the next round of truth
2370440	2378640	is randomly selected in a way that can be deterministically analyzed as as decentralized,
2378640	2382640	as fair. You know, there's no single node in the network that will be able to determine
2382640	2385360	the truth over and over and over again.
2385360	2387440	It's always going to be a different node in the network.
2387760	2393000	So it's this kind of mathematically randomized set of truths.
2393920	2397920	And there's some, you know, so when we talk about truth machine or this idea of
2397920	2402840	blockchain as truth machine, that is the kind of truth that's being produced.
2402840	2408080	It's it's it's, you know, and this is, again, a little bit of an abstraction because,
2408080	2411000	like, OK, we're analyzing proof of work.
2411880	2415880	And so the truth that we're talking about here is whether a transaction happened or
2415880	2419840	not in the Bitcoin blockchain or whatever.
2420360	2424120	And so it's a bit of an extrapolation to talk about kind of more existential or political
2424120	2429840	truths. But I think I do think that extrapolation makes sense because that is the
2429840	2434200	kind of ultimate political imaginary that's at play here in blockchain.
2435920	2442200	But, yeah, it's it's a very particular it's a very particular kind of and strange and
2442200	2446160	funky and quite interesting way of arriving at a set of truths.
2446160	2451360	And I'm sure that that, you know, I do I am curious about, you know, the experiments in
2451360	2457920	this space to see what and how we might be able to use something like this.
2458960	2464720	But I'm also quite firm about finding the very specific appropriate uses of it and really
2464720	2471880	not having this as some kind of overarching ideology, because, like you say, this form
2471880	2476840	of consensus, this way, this method at which to arrive at consensus around truth is a very
2476840	2481720	specific way. It's very different from, let's say, a group of people that get together in
2481720	2486400	a room and share their experiences about something that then arrive at some kind of
2486400	2488600	shared understanding of what has happened.
2490360	2495400	That's a very, very different process and a very, very different way of being in the
2495400	2502160	world and acting in the world and understanding the world than the proof of work consensus
2502160	2502840	algorithm. Right.
2503560	2513320	Actually, I'm keen on looking a bit closer on this subset of being incentive driven,
2513320	2515120	because I think that's quite relevant.
2515960	2518080	And you can see this in other fields as well.
2518080	2526880	When, for example, a blockchain technology has to resolve the problem, how to bridge
2526880	2532440	the gap into the material world, like the non-digital world, then things come into play
2532680	2534080	like oracles and stuff.
2534320	2537280	But these oracles, they are market driven.
2537280	2546400	So it's a monetary incentive that is supposed to deliver the best possible truth, not the
2546400	2547680	ultimate truth, maybe.
2547680	2560200	But it's constructed as if this monetary incentive is able to produce the best workable
2560200	2565240	truth. And I think this goes down to the bottom of the protocol when it comes to
2565240	2572560	something like crypto economics, because there also you have this kind of techno
2572560	2579000	engineering idea or behavioral engineering idea, you call it, I think, in the thesis as
2579000	2591360	well, that you might be able to construct a good system architecture through actually
2591360	2599600	carrots and sticks, which are, again, monetary incentives or the punishment of taking away
2599600	2600920	some money.
2601800	2604080	Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
2604640	2611000	And there, again, it's interesting to look at how things are done or might be done
2611000	2612560	differently in a social scenario.
2612560	2618440	Right. So, you know, we're working with crypto economic designs, then it is very much,
2618440	2623560	like you say, kind of crude, carrot or stick kind of set of tools that are being used.
2623640	2628280	Yeah, I think maybe for the listeners, could you briefly explain what it is?
2628280	2630000	Crypto economics, what that means?
2630800	2634120	Yeah, and it won't be brief, I'm sorry.
2634120	2635600	Go ahead, go ahead.
2635680	2641480	Because because I think, again, there's there's an interesting alternative history that
2641480	2644800	hasn't really been discussed or written much about crypto economics.
2646600	2653440	But crypto economics basically comes from, you know, in the Bitcoin protocol, what you
2653440	2661600	have is a set of miners in the network that verify transactions, and those miners are
2661600	2669120	rewarded with some Bitcoin every time they successfully manage to verify a block of
2669120	2674320	transactions. And they're rewarded with a Bitcoin partially with the idea that if it
2674320	2682280	pays more to contribute to the system than it does to attack it, then you'll have a
2682280	2688680	system that essentially, yeah, it's a it's a kind of element of the security of the
2688680	2693280	system, you'll have a system that runs that runs well.
2693280	2697280	And so you've got you get even more kind of sophisticated versions of that, that, you
2697280	2701720	know, you kind of economically reward good behavior in the network, and economically
2701720	2703720	punish bad behavior in the network.
2704800	2710520	And you see kind of different designs of that in different protocols in the blockchain
2710520	2713000	space. And some of them get very elaborate.
2714000	2717600	And I used a Bitcoin example because it's kind of one of the kind of more simple ones and
2717600	2718600	easier to understand.
2719880	2725560	So, yeah, it's a kind of combination of game theory and market dynamics in a kind of
2725560	2728040	cryptographic decentralized network space.
2729360	2737280	But the other story to that that I think is a very interesting angle is to understand this in
2737280	2743880	terms of business models, because if we take, you know, the kind of business models of
2745920	2752680	platform, the kind of like Internet platforms of today that use a kind of data extraction as
2752680	2760320	their business models, data extraction and advertising, if we want to create new kind
2760360	2768280	of a new type of Internet, you know, Web3, and if we want to create kind of new types of
2768280	2775720	decentralized applications that make it cryptographically impossible for the kind of
2775720	2781320	business models that rely on data extraction in that kind of a way, then we need a different
2781320	2784200	kind of economy that runs these systems.
2784480	2788360	And so for me, the interesting side of crypto economics, the really interesting side of
2788520	2794000	crypto economics is the dream of and the idea of creating systems that are kind of
2794000	2800280	economically autonomous and viable to run without the need for surveillance or
2800280	2804040	surveillance capitalism or platform surveillance or, you know, the kinds of business
2804040	2805920	models that we see run the Internet today.
2805920	2810720	So that for me is like the kind of opportunity, the interesting possibility of crypto
2810720	2811720	economics.
2812480	2817240	Awesome. I think it's really, really important to point that out, because I mean, also for
2817240	2825280	someone like me, it's kind of like overwhelming how the way crypto economics is
2825280	2833360	handled is narrowed down to this idea of actually socio-technical engineering, which
2833360	2839400	I think is really behavioral engineering, which I think is really actually a very
2839400	2846640	dangerous road to to go on, you know, and it's very refreshing the way you did describe
2846760	2853440	it right now that there are also, well, this might be a like acute danger to use the
2853440	2856160	technology in the way of behavioral engineering or such.
2857040	2866800	There are these other possibilities to actually use the technology in a way that is
2866800	2868800	very much beneficial for everybody.
2868880	2875400	Yeah. Yeah. But I think like in order for that to actually be able to happen, the space
2875400	2881840	needs a lot of new thinking, especially from people that come from a heterodox economic
2881840	2887880	thinking, because like right now what you've got is a bunch of programmers and computer
2887880	2890360	engineers tinkering with economic tools.
2890760	2897760	And so and from their perspective, they're trying to achieve certain security properties
2897760	2902040	in the network. And so economics is being used in order to achieve those security
2902080	2905080	properties. And that's why it tends towards behavioral engineering.
2905760	2909840	That's why it tends towards like, how can we kind of make sure that certain types of
2909840	2917480	behaviors, you know, honest behavior is happens, whereas kind of dishonest or malicious
2917480	2919120	behavior is made impossible?
2919120	2922800	You know, so that's like it's really the computer engineers perspective.
2922800	2928440	But if we can have kind of more thinking in the space that looks more at this question of,
2928840	2933040	you know, the business model of the Internet and the kinds of economics that might happen
2933040	2938680	in that space, you know, if we can kind of start deliberately shaping that in some ways,
2938680	2941200	I think that would be like super interesting.
2941280	2944240	I think that's like, yeah, an important direction to work on.
2944800	2951720	Very much so. But I have to say, I think it's in the in the current state, it's not just
2951760	2959040	that the programmers are thinking in terms of security models, and that's why there's
2959040	2963000	this kind of misunderstanding.
2963000	2967480	But I'm afraid that I think what's happening right now, and you can see that in the
2967480	2973280	collaboration between Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and Glenn Whale, an
2973280	2979520	economist who wrote Radical Markets, what like the next level of shit in this sense
2979880	2985120	is that they are very much aware of that.
2985120	2992280	This is not just about security modeling, but they believe crypto economics to be the
2992280	2997080	appropriate social technology to design society.
2997520	2999280	That's that's the impression I get.
2999280	3007200	And that and that for me means that there might be a lesson learned in terms of how
3007200	3014400	autonomous systems are not fully controllable and that we should put some social input
3014400	3018120	into how to govern things and stuff like that, to say just a bit simple.
3018560	3027920	But that in the final step, there's still a belief in engineering society through
3027920	3032520	appropriate technological architectures.
3032520	3039040	Actually, they really call it, he calls it the new social technology, like crypto.
3039040	3040720	Yeah. Yeah.
3040960	3048840	And this is where I think it's important to understand power a little bit better and
3048840	3055360	different forms of power, because in the blockchain space and I think in society in
3055360	3061080	general, when people kind of think of power just off the top of their heads, what comes
3061120	3063400	to mind is a kind of authoritarian dictator.
3063400	3069400	Right. What comes to mind is like a kind of centralized, you know, some kind of centralized
3069400	3074960	power where one person or one party or whatever determines everything and kind of power
3074960	3077760	radiates from that kind of central point.
3079880	3084400	But there's there's so many more theories of power and ways of understanding power that
3084400	3089760	are much more kind of apt at describing our current kind of conditions.
3090720	3097080	One of which, like in the case of what you just described, that is quite useful for
3097080	3105920	understanding, for understanding this condition is like a kind of power that operates
3105920	3108080	more on the landscape of what's possible.
3108080	3117040	So instead of having a centralized person dictate what needs to happen, you kind of
3117040	3121880	model the landscape in a way that makes certain types of things seem like they're just
3121880	3127680	naturally impossible to do or very difficult to do and make other things feel like they're
3127680	3129080	very desirable to do.
3129920	3134120	And that's what a lot of kind of protocological design really is about.
3134120	3138160	And that's what a lot of kind of crypto economic design really is about, is, you know,
3138160	3143400	to kind of make certain types of behavior desirable for someone on a kind of intuitive
3143400	3146960	level. So it doesn't feel like an authority is dictating anything to you.
3146960	3149080	It's just the way the landscape looks.
3149080	3153320	It's easier to go that, you know, down that road than it is to climb over that hedge.
3153320	3162760	You know, and so, you know, I think keeping an eye on that is is is very important also
3162760	3169680	to be able to analyze, you know, analyze what is the types of, you know, what is the
3169680	3173560	politics that's being inscribed in the protocols that then shape that landscape, you know?
3175920	3180240	Yeah. What's the main takeaway from your research?
3181960	3189720	Oh, wow. The main takeaway.
3189720	3201880	Give me one moment, because there's so many that we've touched on.
3201880	3203480	What's the main takeaway for you?
3203480	3209400	I think it's that we should all be aware that there is no wholesale answer to anything,
3209400	3217640	actually, and that these things are, like, context specific and that they have, like,
3217720	3226280	a side that might benefit us that is very much context specific, but another one that is not.
3226280	3230280	And we shouldn't, like, alles über einen Kamm scheren.
3230280	3231720	I don't know the English word for that.
3231720	3235480	Like, we shouldn't approach it as if it's all the same.
3236360	3238280	Take a second look. Maybe that's.
3238280	3241400	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right.
3241400	3243800	I mean, really, that is the main takeaway.
3243800	3254920	The main takeaway is, or the main work that I'm trying to do here is to, first of all,
3254920	3263480	shift the understanding away from trying to arrive at some final solutions to problems
3263480	3271880	of power and politics and these issues, and to create some ways to feel OK about the fact
3271880	3279960	that we do live in an infinitely complex world and universe where the work is ongoing.
3280440	3282360	And that's part of the excitement of things, right?
3283560	3286040	These new technologies can do incredible things.
3288040	3289320	History doesn't stop.
3289320	3290440	The work doesn't stop.
3290440	3291640	The game doesn't stop.
3291640	3292760	The kind of interaction.
3292760	3295320	I mean, there's so much more interesting things to come.
3296440	3299800	And all this stuff will break and get old at some point,
3300680	3302840	and we'll move on and something else will happen.
3302840	3306920	And it's really kind of tracing through and sticking.
3307720	3312120	There's just a fantastic title of a book by Donna Haraway that came out last year,
3312760	3314120	Staying with the Trouble.
3314120	3315000	That's what it's about.
3318760	3324440	And I say this not as a kind of trying to create some kind of new universal statement,
3324440	3327000	but more like literally staying with the trouble
3327960	3332120	and understanding the details of how these technologies play out
3332120	3334760	and getting involved in how they play out.
3335640	3336520	Great final words.
3337080	3340520	I usually put one question at the end,
3341160	3344760	which is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
3347720	3352120	If I think about the future, what makes it that the future is radically open.
3352600	3357080	The future has never been more radically open than it feels right now.
3357080	3358440	And that to me is incredible.
3359720	3360360	Awesome.
