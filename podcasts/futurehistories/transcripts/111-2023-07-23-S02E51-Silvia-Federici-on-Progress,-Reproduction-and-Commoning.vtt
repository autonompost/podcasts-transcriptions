00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

00:05.400 --> 00:08.460
Silvia Federici in today's episode.

00:08.460 --> 00:14.560
She is a highly influential feminist scholar, teacher and activist known for her groundbreaking

00:14.560 --> 00:20.480
work on the intersections of capitalism, patriarchy and reproductive labor.

00:20.480 --> 00:26.820
I am very happy that this episode came together, since Silvia's work provides crucial insight

00:26.820 --> 00:32.500
into the question of how the separation of spheres in which there is a sphere of production,

00:32.500 --> 00:38.820
which is imagined as separate of a sphere of reproduction, how this imagined separation

00:38.820 --> 00:40.860
might be overcome.

00:40.860 --> 00:47.580
This podcast here has featured quite a few models of democratic economic planning, which,

00:47.580 --> 00:52.860
I have to be honest, oftentimes struggle to treat this question adequately.

00:52.900 --> 00:57.420
And it's great to have Silvia bring in her perspective on these topics.

00:57.420 --> 01:02.840
And since we touch up on the topic of commoning and commons in the course of our conversation

01:02.840 --> 01:09.060
as well, if you're interested in questions of how democratic coordination of commoning

01:09.060 --> 01:15.180
on a scale, I wanted to point you towards the newly translated book by Stefan Merec

01:15.180 --> 01:20.220
and Simon Sutterluty called Make Capitalism History.

01:20.220 --> 01:23.980
You'll find the open access publication in the show notes.

01:23.980 --> 01:30.780
And then another note, just like the episodes with Matt Huber and Elisa Longkorn anti-Leo,

01:30.780 --> 01:36.140
this episode also came together because of a conference I was recently invited to take

01:36.140 --> 01:37.140
part in.

01:37.140 --> 01:43.100
The conference was titled The Great Transition, and I was invited to take part in a symposium

01:43.100 --> 01:45.420
on democratic planning.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.860
And I just wanted to take the chance to say thanks to everybody involved.

01:50.860 --> 01:58.020
Before we start, I wanted to also thank Lukas, Wilfried, and Carl for their kind donations.

01:58.020 --> 02:02.420
And now please enjoy today's episode with Silvia Federici.

02:07.420 --> 02:11.820
Silvia, I'm thrilled and honored to have you on the show.

02:11.820 --> 02:12.820
Welcome.

02:12.820 --> 02:13.820
Yes.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.220
Thank you so much.

02:15.220 --> 02:23.180
And, you know, I would like this to be a conversation and you introduce me to the topic of today

02:23.180 --> 02:30.900
and give me a little bit of the background of, you know, introduce your audience to the

02:30.900 --> 02:34.460
issues and the topic that we're going to discuss today.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.460
Yes, absolutely.

02:35.460 --> 02:42.060
Well, I think we will start with a question that goes in the direction of your critique

02:42.700 --> 02:49.540
towards the idea of progress, and then we'll kind of move along to topics of commons and

02:49.540 --> 02:52.060
topics of democratic planning, maybe.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.460
I'm very much interested in this topic.

02:54.460 --> 03:00.500
And at the end, I will have some questions around the question whether or not we should

03:00.500 --> 03:07.980
overcome the category of labor as such, because in some of the models for democratic planning,

03:07.980 --> 03:13.340
for example, unfortunately, the category of labor is not overcome and there are still

03:13.340 --> 03:17.380
some forms of connection between work and pay.

03:17.380 --> 03:21.820
And I'm quite critical of this approach, so I would be interested in what you think about

03:21.820 --> 03:22.820
it.

03:22.820 --> 03:27.820
But we will start with a question on progress, if that's all right with you.

03:28.180 --> 03:38.180
Of course, you know, but there is a broad literature to which, you know, I refer, actually,

03:38.180 --> 03:48.060
that has criticized, you know, progress as enlightenment, bourgeois conception, you know,

03:48.060 --> 03:50.740
that it's very evolutionary.

03:50.740 --> 04:00.220
It's a very evolutionary conception, but has been used to actually justify, you know, capitalist

04:00.220 --> 04:11.500
development, yes, justify and in a sense, you know, erase, erase the cost of it, erase,

04:11.500 --> 04:20.660
you know, all the atrocities that capitalist development has left and in its wake.

04:20.660 --> 04:27.660
So and, you know, sponsored in order to realize.

04:27.660 --> 04:31.020
So progress, it's a great lie.

04:31.020 --> 04:36.900
Progress is the great lie, you know, of capitalist ideology.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.900
And in fact, we can really measure.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.900
How do we measure progress?

04:41.900 --> 04:45.340
I think this is a very fundamental question.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.820
How do we measure progress?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.060
What are the value?

04:48.220 --> 04:57.220
What are the core value that enable us to decide whether a society is progressing or not?

04:57.220 --> 05:04.580
And within capitalist ideology, you know, progress is measured in terms of technological

05:04.580 --> 05:11.180
development, so that today, for example, we can communicate Vienna and New York.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.380
We can communicate this is progress.

05:13.380 --> 05:18.260
Obviously, people could not do it in the Middle Ages.

05:18.260 --> 05:25.980
But when we look, for example, today in terms of true exchange of knowledge, can we really

05:25.980 --> 05:34.260
say that the technology has allowed human being as a whole, you know, the human community

05:34.260 --> 05:41.820
to really exchange, grow in terms of its understanding of each other?

05:41.820 --> 05:43.780
No, obviously not.

05:43.780 --> 05:49.300
You know, we have a situation of permanent wealth here now in most parts of the world.

05:49.300 --> 05:56.020
If we did have real progress, we wouldn't have two centuries of capitalist development

05:56.020 --> 06:01.020
that have destroyed the life of millions and millions and millions of people.

06:01.020 --> 06:09.300
No, so that when technological development is, in fact, as in fact, being primarily put

06:09.300 --> 06:16.140
at the service, you know, of capitalist accumulation of individual private wealth and

06:16.140 --> 06:22.900
military destruction, World War One, millions of people killed, World War Two, the threat

06:22.900 --> 06:30.620
of nuclear warfare, we are now speaking of a society in which even life, even human life

06:30.620 --> 06:38.100
is such because of the technology, because of the very so-called technological development

06:38.180 --> 06:45.540
that is associated with the notion of progress, then we can see that we have to really

06:46.260 --> 06:54.020
reconceptualize what is valuable, you know, what is that we should struggle for, what kind of

06:54.020 --> 07:03.620
society we want to construct. So let's leave behind as totally tainted the notion of progress

07:03.620 --> 07:12.580
and instead seeing that this development that is associated with progress, you know,

07:12.580 --> 07:18.100
as in fact brought more and more misery, more and more impoverishment. Today there are millions

07:18.100 --> 07:23.140
and millions of people who are totally impoverished, who have been expelled from their lands,

07:23.140 --> 07:30.900
whose cultures have been destroyed, thousands of languages, species, you know, natural species,

07:30.900 --> 07:36.820
and also human community have been completely destroyed. Entire cultural world is like,

07:36.820 --> 07:42.740
what progress is that? What is the measurement we use? So this is my response to progress.

07:43.300 --> 07:50.340
There is this strand within like orthodox Marxism, which likes to argue that first there

07:50.340 --> 07:56.580
has to be capitalism that would sufficiently develop the forces of production and only then

07:56.660 --> 08:03.140
on the basis of that, like real communism would be possible. And of course, you refuse this notion,

08:03.140 --> 08:10.900
but I'm asking myself, what does this mean for alternatives to capitalism then for

08:10.900 --> 08:17.380
this idea of transition as well? Because I have to think, for example, about the recent work of

08:17.380 --> 08:23.220
Kohai Saito. I don't know if you're familiar with his work. He's developing this idea of degrowth

08:23.780 --> 08:31.860
communism, which is kind of arguing in a similar direction that progress in the capitalist sense

08:31.860 --> 08:36.820
is not necessary to develop communism. I would be interested in your opinion

08:36.820 --> 08:44.740
on what does this mean to reject this specific idea of progress for the question of alternatives

08:44.740 --> 08:52.180
to capitalism. Absolutely. So the question of, I think, Marx's idea, and you know,

08:52.900 --> 09:00.420
it would be very interesting. I think that probably Marx lived at the historical

09:00.420 --> 09:07.140
and political conjunction. This is the sense I can make of it, that he lived at historical

09:07.140 --> 09:20.740
political conjunction, where the possibility of a broad social change, of a crisis of capitalism,

09:20.740 --> 09:29.700
of the end of capitalism, seemed to be near, seemed to be soon possible. Therefore,

09:30.340 --> 09:36.500
you know, this image, you know, of the worker who takes over the capitalist machine

09:37.220 --> 09:46.500
and now redirects it, you know, once, you know, redirects it to a different goal, redirects it,

09:46.500 --> 09:53.460
you know, to the benefit of humanity, to an egalitarian, the purposes of an egalitarian

09:53.460 --> 10:03.380
society, etc., etc. So I think this is how I can justify Marx's idea that in a way, capitalism,

10:03.380 --> 10:10.500
obviously, you know, capitalism, a necessary stage, well, necessary because it was an inevitable

10:10.500 --> 10:16.740
stage from the point of view, you know, obviously of the power relation in Europe, but that it would

10:16.740 --> 10:25.860
be necessary, you know, for constructing the condition, you know, of a communist society,

10:25.860 --> 10:34.420
you know. As I said, Marx must have come to this conclusion only because he believed the revolution

10:34.420 --> 10:43.700
was imminent. Otherwise, he would have had to consider what is the cost, you know, of a process

10:43.700 --> 10:50.260
of large scale industrialization across the world, even from the point of view,

10:50.900 --> 11:00.500
right, of, you know, what it costs to industrialize the globe in terms of its impact of nature.

11:01.140 --> 11:09.540
But that's only one consideration. What he did not consider is the capitalist development

11:10.180 --> 11:18.100
destroys the very condition for a communist society, creates technological conditions,

11:18.100 --> 11:24.020
but destroys other conditions, destroy, for example, changes, people's subjectivities,

11:24.900 --> 11:35.700
you know, destroys common solidarity, destroys commonality, and, you know, so whereas

11:36.500 --> 11:45.140
it creates, you know, new technological means, new technological means, at the same time there's

11:45.140 --> 11:52.740
a process of destruction, of destruction of human relations, you know, that makes the advantage of

11:52.740 --> 12:00.180
a new technology, the advantage of a new technology, right, you know, limits tremendously what the

12:00.180 --> 12:09.220
advantage, and there's a third consideration, which is, is it really technological underdevelopment

12:09.940 --> 12:16.980
that was the cause in the Middle Ages or other society, you know, of people's misery, of people's

12:16.980 --> 12:24.340
hunger, of communities inability to reproduce themselves, or it was the social relation,

12:25.060 --> 12:30.980
the fact that in the Middle Ages you had a feudal old, a feudal world that was built on the

12:30.980 --> 12:38.580
exploitation of people, where those who made decision was a military class, right, so the idea

12:39.140 --> 12:48.100
that in a way capitalism was necessary because it provided the means to, you know, overcome hunger,

12:48.100 --> 12:54.740
overcome poverty, overcome scarcity, no, technology was never the problem of scarcity,

12:55.540 --> 13:02.020
technology, the lack of technology, and we know, for example, that there were other roads to

13:02.020 --> 13:08.420
technological development, for example in China, China had reached a quite high level of technological

13:08.420 --> 13:15.060
development by the 16th century, there were other roads to technology, other than the capitalist one,

13:15.620 --> 13:21.300
that the fact that the capitalist road to technological development, you know, was built

13:21.300 --> 13:28.900
on the exploitation of labor, on the destruction of community, on violence, all this also

13:30.100 --> 13:36.580
undermined, you know, the advantages, and moreover, what, what technology was invented,

13:36.580 --> 13:40.580
capitalism invented a technology that was instrumental to exploitation,

13:41.460 --> 13:48.820
it's not the technology, technology is not a general term, technology is not a universal,

13:48.820 --> 13:56.340
you know, road or a form of wealth, you know, what kind of technology capitalism has developed,

13:56.340 --> 14:01.620
other type of technology, the technology capitalism has developed has always been a

14:01.620 --> 14:10.820
political technology, a technology that served to defeat, right, to contrast, you know, work as

14:10.820 --> 14:17.140
solidarity, work as capacity to resist, work as capacity to struggle, so it is the technology

14:17.140 --> 14:23.540
that has always had built within it a political problem, capitalist technology has always built

14:23.540 --> 14:31.380
within itself elements that made it impossible to take over by a communist, a real communist

14:31.380 --> 14:37.700
society, for instance, disregard for nature, a technology that has disregard for nature is not

14:37.700 --> 14:42.980
a technology we can use, it's not a technology that should be generalized across the world,

14:42.980 --> 14:50.500
a technology that is built within itself, you know, a program that is antagonistic to work as

14:50.500 --> 14:56.100
solidarity, antagonistic, so yes, capitalism brings workers together, but how it brings workers

14:56.100 --> 15:04.100
together, not in a way that enhances their solidarity, so I think that Marx was wrong

15:04.660 --> 15:11.620
in terms of this idea that of the transfer of technology, right, okay, so the revolution

15:11.620 --> 15:16.420
and then we take over the machine and we put the machine to good use, well that machine could not

15:16.420 --> 15:23.380
be put because it had built-in problems, other machines have to be used, no, and secondly,

15:23.380 --> 15:30.180
it did not see the kind of devastation, you know, and now it's all too obvious,

15:30.820 --> 15:39.460
now it's all too obvious. One last thing, I don't particularly, of course, I'm against the idea of

15:39.460 --> 15:44.420
capitalist growth because capitalist world growth is capitalist development, it's capitalism,

15:45.060 --> 15:52.500
right, but I don't think that growth is the enemy, the enemy is capitalism, growth is a

15:52.500 --> 16:01.060
subcategory, it's a subcategory, it's one of the pieces, right, it's one of the strategies

16:01.060 --> 16:08.820
that capitalism uses to reproduce itself, no, but it's not growth, the enemy is capitalism,

16:08.820 --> 16:14.340
the enemy is the exploitation of nature and humanity, this is the fundamental and in this,

16:14.340 --> 16:23.620
in a way, I agree with Marx, you know, that I think that the powerful expert and still alive

16:23.620 --> 16:32.660
and still fundamental expert of Marx's work, you know, is having focus and identify capitalism

16:32.660 --> 16:40.180
as a system that is built, you know, on the accumulation of people's labor, on the exploitation,

16:40.180 --> 16:48.900
on expropriation, dispossession, right, on therefore these forms of, you know, alienation,

16:48.900 --> 16:54.260
enslavement, et cetera, et cetera, and constant immiseration because once you take away from people

16:54.260 --> 17:01.300
the means of their reproduction, then there is no limit to how much you can immiserate their life,

17:01.300 --> 17:06.420
and we see now where we live in a world of permanent welfare, permanent dispossession,

17:06.420 --> 17:13.460
millions and millions thrown, you know, into refugee camps, you know, entire areas,

17:13.460 --> 17:22.020
you know, of the world destroyed by climatic change. So, yes, we really need to rethink

17:22.020 --> 17:26.020
this idea about the necessity of capitalism, God forbid.

17:27.780 --> 17:34.740
Yeah, and I would really like to explore a bit the question of alternatives because

17:35.460 --> 17:43.780
if we do not go along the road of ideas of, let's say, socialist modernity, so to speak,

17:43.780 --> 17:49.140
what is the alternative that you would like to come about? I mean, you already pointed towards

17:49.140 --> 17:54.500
we, of course, need alternative social relations. We might also need alternative technologies,

17:54.500 --> 18:00.100
you pointed out. I mean, you are quite famous for your engagement with this idea of commoning.

18:00.100 --> 18:06.020
It's an important part of your research. I'm quite sure that commoning would have to be an

18:06.020 --> 18:12.500
element of the alternative as well, but there are many examples where commoning works quite well

18:12.500 --> 18:19.540
within communal structures up to a certain size, I would say. Community-supported agriculture would

18:19.540 --> 18:26.420
be one example, and there are many, many more, and there are also examples for commoning on a global

18:26.420 --> 18:33.700
scale in the realm of digital commons, which are easily reproducible and, let's say, nonrivalous.

18:35.140 --> 18:45.860
There are less examples for global commons that are rival resources, so to speak. I would be

18:45.860 --> 18:52.180
interested in how you think about what might collective forms of organization look like

18:52.180 --> 18:59.860
at a level of society as a whole that are organized along this principle of commoning.

18:59.860 --> 19:10.740
Yeah, so first of all, what commons will be like is almost very difficult, and I don't think it is

19:10.740 --> 19:21.380
useful to actually have a map, a theoretical political map now, because even our own imagination

19:21.380 --> 19:29.300
is very much conditioned by what we have, but the situation that we are living. So the definition

19:29.300 --> 19:34.900
of what kind of a communal society will be, you know, is something that is a process,

19:35.540 --> 19:41.620
and it's something that can be defined only in a process of struggle, and in a process of struggle,

19:41.620 --> 19:48.580
and the coming together of different struggles across the globe, because there's not one model,

19:48.580 --> 19:54.820
as Massimo de Angelis has written over and over and very eloquently, the idea

19:55.380 --> 20:02.260
that, you know, in this great globe, Asia, Africa, with different history, different climatic

20:02.260 --> 20:10.180
situations, different trajectories, that there could be a model of commons, that this is

20:10.980 --> 20:18.740
unthinkable. Like the Separatists say, many yeses, one no, no to the exploitation,

20:18.740 --> 20:24.980
no to capitalism, and then many yeses, many roads, different roads, you know,

20:26.900 --> 20:32.340
shaped by the historic trajectories, the historic struggles that people have made,

20:32.340 --> 20:39.860
right? So this is very, very important, and I think, first of all, no to global commons.

20:39.860 --> 20:44.900
There's no such a thing as global commons. Who's going to be the agent to make decisions

20:44.900 --> 20:49.220
on a global level? We don't have a global subject. Now we have the UN, and we know what the

20:49.220 --> 20:56.180
disaster the United Nations has been. So if we're talking about, and here we are already entering

20:56.180 --> 21:02.820
the discussion of what is democracy. Democracy is the rule of the people. So how do people rule,

21:02.820 --> 21:08.340
you know, who is the global subject, right? The idea of a global superstructure, this is what

21:08.340 --> 21:14.420
capitalism has, has created, and we know what the global superstructure is. Capitalism is the

21:14.420 --> 21:21.860
United Nations, which is really the, you know, institutional face of capital, international

21:21.860 --> 21:30.340
capital. So no to that global idea of a global commons. I want to quote here, over and over,

21:30.340 --> 21:35.620
Maria Mies, who just died, you know, a great feminist, one of the most lucid, powerful

21:36.340 --> 21:44.340
anti-capitalist voices within the feminist movement. And she was very adamant about rejecting

21:44.340 --> 21:52.340
the idea of the global commons, right? And so, you know, what we are talking about, you know,

21:52.340 --> 22:03.300
is instead replanting, you know, rerouting, you know, decision making, the construction of

22:03.300 --> 22:11.460
community, you know, and the construction of commons, right, on localities, which doesn't mean

22:11.460 --> 22:18.580
that they are fragmented, isolated, and unconnected. Absolutely not. And here I,

22:18.580 --> 22:27.060
you know, I want to make reference, for instance, to what, you know, what we call Latin American was,

22:27.060 --> 22:34.980
you know, before the conquest, before colonization, you know, when you had, you know, a vast world

22:34.980 --> 22:42.900
all throughout, you know, from the south of the continent to the north, of local economies,

22:43.540 --> 22:50.020
local society, and yet with a tremendous amount of exchange, with a tremendous amount of

22:50.020 --> 22:57.700
interconnection, right? So it's not true that to think of local commons is to think,

22:57.700 --> 23:05.620
you know, of isolation, of going back to the Stone Age. Not at all. Not at all. It means that

23:05.620 --> 23:12.340
to have, for example, for instance, of confederacies of commons, you know, and of

23:12.340 --> 23:19.540
course today we also, some of the technologies, some of the means that are in existence can also

23:19.540 --> 23:27.380
be used, can also be used, but with great discrimination, with great discrimination.

23:28.260 --> 23:36.180
And about digital commons. Well, digital commons, right? I'm always a bit hesitant

23:36.180 --> 23:43.460
and skeptical, you know, before embracing them, because when I think of digital today,

23:43.460 --> 23:49.220
I immediately think, you know, massacres in the Congo. This is what I immediately think.

23:49.220 --> 23:54.500
Not only the Congo, but I'm thinking of lithium. I think, where's the lithium coming from?

23:54.980 --> 23:59.300
Where's the coltan? Where's the real earth? Where are all the minerals?

23:59.300 --> 24:05.140
And so far, you know, those minerals have been the disaster, have been the cause of wars,

24:05.140 --> 24:10.500
have been the cause of massacres, have been the cause of recolonization of entire areas of the

24:10.500 --> 24:18.580
world. So unless we find, you know, unless the question of not only what can be done with the

24:18.580 --> 24:25.700
digital, but how the digital is produced, unless the question becomes central to the discussion on

24:25.700 --> 24:32.740
digital commons, then I have to say, no, this cannot be the solution, because we have to

24:33.300 --> 24:41.220
realize that behind much of the warfare and much of the predatory practices, the incredibly

24:41.220 --> 24:47.620
predatory practices of international capital today, especially in Africa, Latin America,

24:47.620 --> 24:54.980
there is exactly, you know, the need to feed this new technology, right? And unfortunately also,

24:54.980 --> 25:00.260
you know, the new green technology, the one that is supposed to, you know, save the earth,

25:00.260 --> 25:06.100
right? Which now depends on the production of billions of batteries, you know, for electrical

25:06.100 --> 25:12.420
cars. Where are those batteries going to go? In which ocean? In which fields? Who is going to be

25:12.420 --> 25:17.540
the beneficiary of all that poison that is going to leak out of those batteries?

25:18.580 --> 25:25.220
So I think we have to be careful with the digital commons. And I think we need instead to see what

25:25.220 --> 25:31.860
gives power back to community, back to the people who are knowledgeable about the condition of the

25:31.860 --> 25:37.860
earth, of the soil, and the condition of the social relation of the places in which they live.

25:37.940 --> 25:45.140
I mean, it's also the construction of humanity. You know, we are becoming, and now we're AI,

25:45.140 --> 25:51.540
and you know, we are becoming zombies. We are really, you know, artificial intelligence is a

25:51.540 --> 25:59.060
big problem. The problem is also the mechanization of human beings. The mechanization of human beings.

25:59.060 --> 26:09.780
I'm really flabbergasted about how much, you know, population that seem to have all this power,

26:09.780 --> 26:19.860
the computer, the little phone, and so on, you know, are in fact unable to really impact

26:19.860 --> 26:28.340
in a significant way the politics, you know, of international capital. And at times,

26:28.340 --> 26:37.460
I even think that precisely access to these gadgets, you know, have in a sense put back the

26:37.460 --> 26:46.420
struggle, dozens and dozens of years. In other words, the capitalism, you know, with the computer,

26:46.420 --> 26:54.420
with the iPhone, the iPad, and all of that, you know, as pacified, as succeeded in pacifying,

26:54.420 --> 27:03.780
and giving people assimilated of a power that in fact we don't have. Yes, we can call this,

27:03.780 --> 27:10.820
yes, we can call that, but actually decisions are being made that are extraordinary, extraordinary.

27:10.820 --> 27:16.100
We have people in the streets in New York. We have people dying in the streets in New York.

27:16.100 --> 27:22.820
We have the largest incarceration, the larger number of people incarcerated. This society,

27:22.820 --> 27:29.940
which is, you know, the leading capitalist society, presumably in prosperity, you know,

27:29.940 --> 27:35.780
is a society where people are dying in the street, where we have the life, where people have been

27:35.780 --> 27:44.980
executed with summary processes, you know, not to mention, not to mention, you know, the 800 jails

27:44.980 --> 27:50.100
that the US is running across the world, the military intervention in much of the world,

27:50.100 --> 27:57.460
and we are not able to stop it. And so I've been wondering how much this technology,

27:57.460 --> 28:05.780
which has been thrown at us and made more available, has also given this pseudo-empowerment,

28:06.500 --> 28:09.940
pseudo-empowerment, and I'm not saying that there are not advantages to it,

28:10.580 --> 28:18.340
right, but certainly we are very unaware on a day-to-day basis of the cost of this technology.

28:18.340 --> 28:23.860
We don't know whose fields have been expropriated in order to create the iPhone,

28:24.420 --> 28:30.180
right, that we use on a day or the computer that we use. We are totally unaware of that.

28:30.180 --> 28:37.380
So the distancing also, the capitalism has produced the distances of the places where

28:37.380 --> 28:41.620
things are extracted, where things are produced, and where things are consumed.

28:42.180 --> 28:49.060
That distances that makes us irresponsible, responsible and irresponsible, right? It's

28:49.060 --> 28:55.700
really a serious problem. So we need actually to bring together production and consumption

28:55.700 --> 29:04.340
so that we know, that we know if the oranges we eat, if the clothes that we wear have caused

29:04.340 --> 29:13.460
somebody's blood, have caused somebody's life, have caused somebody's loss of land and forced

29:13.460 --> 29:22.660
migration. Yeah. Let's maybe dig a little deeper into that because this idea of bringing together

29:22.660 --> 29:30.180
production and reproduction, or maybe in other terms transcend this idea of separation of spheres,

29:30.180 --> 29:36.020
this is really important, I think, as you already pointed towards right now. I would

29:36.020 --> 29:43.380
be interested in what this might look like in connection to this question of organization,

29:43.380 --> 29:50.420
because you refused this idea of a global commons that would have a form of meta-organization,

29:50.420 --> 29:56.820
so to speak, but you also pointed out that there will be quite a lot of coordination going on

29:56.820 --> 30:02.500
between the different commons. So maybe we can cross these two. Then the question would be,

30:03.140 --> 30:11.380
what would a form of organizing a mode of reproduction, so to speak, what would that

30:11.380 --> 30:18.900
look like when these separations of spheres of production on the one side and reproduction

30:18.980 --> 30:27.860
on the other is overcome? So how to organize a, let's say, mode of reproduction between these

30:27.860 --> 30:35.540
different commons and projects and whatever entities there might be to coordinate with?

30:36.820 --> 30:43.300
Yeah. This, of course, again, that cannot be a universal model. I mean, I imagine if you are

30:43.300 --> 30:49.060
living in Eskimo land or if you're living in Mozambique, there are very different

30:49.060 --> 30:55.220
possibilities, right? I'm thinking, for instance, in pre-Columbian America, the example of Peru,

30:55.220 --> 31:02.820
you know Peru is a very elongated territory, and that elongated territory made for very different

31:02.820 --> 31:12.020
types of cultivation, very different types of cultivation. So Peru, before the conquest,

31:12.580 --> 31:22.020
was very alive, was an intricate system of exchanges that enabled people within a limited

31:22.020 --> 31:29.700
territory after all, you know, to in fact benefit, you know, from production coming from different

31:29.700 --> 31:36.740
areas, from different types of production. And, you know, of course, now we are in another world,

31:36.740 --> 31:44.580
but this is something that now we can think of, right? In other words, when I was speaking of,

31:44.580 --> 31:53.380
you know, the Confederacy of Commons, you know, I think that this also has implications on the

31:53.380 --> 32:01.300
condition of production, which means that exchanges, yes, but not exchanges, you know,

32:01.300 --> 32:06.820
you go to a supermarket today and, you know, perhaps the fish in the United States, you know,

32:06.820 --> 32:13.860
may be coming from Africa or may be coming from across the world. And it's different if the fish

32:13.860 --> 32:22.900
may come from Long Island or from areas. And so where, in fact, the possibility of the economic

32:22.900 --> 32:31.060
exchange, right, is not only an ecological disaster as it is today, all these boxes,

32:31.620 --> 32:36.980
all these boats, all these that are really destroying the planet,

32:38.180 --> 32:45.940
but also allows for the circulation of human relations, so that you know the people from

32:46.020 --> 32:54.100
which the food is coming. They are actually human social, cultural interchanges. This is a kind of

32:54.100 --> 33:00.260
world that we want to reconstruct. And today we have in a very atomic form, you know, with the

33:00.260 --> 33:08.020
community-supported agriculture, for instance, as a little, as a microcosm, right? But when you look

33:08.020 --> 33:14.740
and analyze it and you expand it, as if on a computer, and you expand it, then you see that

33:14.740 --> 33:20.980
what is being exchanged, you know, is not only the food, what is being brought to the city from

33:20.980 --> 33:27.620
the farms and so on. It's not only the food, but there is also a whole set of relations, right?

33:27.620 --> 33:33.060
People are getting to know, yeah, who are the producers. You begin to develop a relationship

33:33.060 --> 33:40.420
of trust, right? You begin to understand more about what is actually being produced, you know?

33:40.420 --> 33:47.060
What are the vegetables of this season? You don't have these, you know, plastic enveloped,

33:47.060 --> 33:55.620
you know, universal, ever-present, you know, ever-available, you know, food production,

33:55.620 --> 34:01.540
no? But you actually begin to understand. So there is a richness that we have lost.

34:02.100 --> 34:08.020
There is a richness of, and I think of that way, I think of the way of expanding scale,

34:08.020 --> 34:13.940
you know, every different modalities, obviously, depending on, you know, communities on the

34:13.940 --> 34:21.380
mountains, communities on the sea, you know, but something along those lines, you know, it's,

34:21.380 --> 34:32.100
I think, and I come back to my original point that much of this is also something that we learn

34:32.740 --> 34:39.060
in the process of the struggle, which is, has to be a process of construction,

34:39.700 --> 34:46.500
not just resistance, but construction, experimentation. The struggle is a moment

34:46.500 --> 34:53.060
not only to say no, but to experiment with alternative. From the beginning, there is no

34:53.060 --> 34:58.580
real struggle unless it is accompanied by an immediate transformation of relation among the

34:58.580 --> 35:03.780
people who are doing the struggle. Unless the struggle immediately constructs something new.

35:03.780 --> 35:08.260
It's not just a no, but it's a yes to a different kind of social relations.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.500
Maybe we can carve out...

35:13.780 --> 35:18.820
I say the commons are a condition of the struggle, are a condition of the social

35:18.820 --> 35:24.020
transformation. They are not just the goal, the objective of the social transformation.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.900
They are the conditions. They are the ones that make it possible.

35:28.660 --> 35:36.500
Yeah, and I mean, I think even though you kind of are a bit hesitant to reach too far ahead in

35:36.500 --> 35:42.420
order not to prescribe some form of model or something like that, I still think that there are

35:43.140 --> 35:52.820
some, let's say, maybe basic coordinates that can be distilled from this type of approach. So,

35:53.380 --> 35:58.820
one you just pointed towards, it's not just about resistance, but also about construction.

35:58.820 --> 36:03.140
Maybe one might say creative construction, experimental construction.

36:05.860 --> 36:11.140
I think there are some basic coordinates that one might distill from this approach.

36:11.140 --> 36:18.900
For example, as I pointed towards earlier, this question of labor and whether or not in alternative

36:18.900 --> 36:25.940
modes of, in this case, modes of reproduction, one would want to reproduce this category of

36:25.940 --> 36:32.340
labor or not. Because within the models of democratic economic planning that I engage with,

36:32.340 --> 36:39.620
oftentimes these socialist models of democratic planning that I know, they usually tend to

36:39.620 --> 36:47.220
reproduce and maintain this category of labor along with a form of remuneration that is paid

36:47.220 --> 36:53.540
in exchange for work. So, this remuneration is, of course, not a classical wage relation then,

36:53.540 --> 36:59.940
because it doesn't involve a surplus that is going to a capitalist. But still, the category of labor

36:59.940 --> 37:07.780
as such and this exchange relation in the form of work for pay tends to be reproduced. I would be

37:07.780 --> 37:13.860
interested in how you think about this, because within these models, at least, the rationale,

37:13.860 --> 37:20.180
the argument of the people developing these models is kind of along this traditional idea of

37:20.180 --> 37:26.340
two-phase model developed by Marx in the Goethe Program, where the idea is that you would have to

37:26.340 --> 37:34.660
have a first phase where this connection between work and pay is still in place. And then afterwards,

37:34.660 --> 37:42.340
you would have the ability to come to a second phase. But this all rests on this idea of progress

37:42.340 --> 37:49.940
that you, of course, reject. So, I assume you would reject this two-phase model as well and the idea

37:49.940 --> 37:57.620
of continuation of labor as a category as such as well. Am I right in assuming that?

37:59.780 --> 38:01.300
So, it's a long story. Too much.

38:02.580 --> 38:08.900
A lot of things. No, I disagree. The idea of the two-phase is not the idea of progress.

38:09.860 --> 38:21.060
I just, the idea of progress is the ideas of this almost natural development that is attributed

38:22.500 --> 38:30.580
to social. It's a way of naturalizing social relation and particularly capitalist relation,

38:30.580 --> 38:36.500
right? Inevitably. So, the old is bad and we're going towards the new and the new, of course,

38:36.500 --> 38:43.140
and also the connection with technology. No, labor. First of all, the distinction,

38:43.140 --> 38:50.100
I think also in Marx, labor and work, right? The idea of labor implies exploitation. Labor implies

38:50.100 --> 38:56.340
exploitation. So, I think there's a difference between labor and activity, right? Activity,

38:56.340 --> 39:03.700
creative activity, self-determined or collectively self-determined. Not individually, but activity

39:03.700 --> 39:09.780
that is very different from labor which is done under somebody else's, you know, decision-making,

39:09.780 --> 39:17.460
et cetera, right? So, I think in terms of the transition and the question of money,

39:18.180 --> 39:24.820
you know, I think in terms of a transition and I faced this issue so many times because there was

39:24.820 --> 39:30.740
a time in my life I was involved in a feminist international organization called Wages for

39:30.740 --> 39:39.380
Housework and we were accused of institutionalizing women in the home. We were accused of

39:39.380 --> 39:46.900
confirming capitalism, monetizing the only sphere of life in which, you know, love, et cetera, et

39:46.900 --> 39:53.380
cetera. And I famously, you know, thought that, you know, famously because that has been the most

39:53.380 --> 39:59.380
popular things I've said in my life. Yeah, you know, they call it love. We call it unpaid labor.

40:00.740 --> 40:09.460
And I still stay behind it. I still subscribe to it. So, the question of money. The question of

40:09.460 --> 40:21.940
money is two points I want to make. Number one, struggle for monetary compensation. It's inevitable

40:22.900 --> 40:32.500
until we can change the power relation between workers and capital because as long as we do not

40:32.500 --> 40:40.900
re-appropriate the material condition of our reproduction, then we need to use money. Otherwise,

40:40.900 --> 40:48.580
we die. The Zapatistas who have been, you know, the group of people, to my knowledge, who have

40:48.580 --> 40:58.660
been most advanced in refusing monetary relation, they still use some money. They sell coffee for

40:58.660 --> 41:07.380
monetary compensation because they have not been able yet to create all the material condition

41:07.380 --> 41:14.100
of reproduction that are necessary without some money. So, as long as we are in a society

41:14.820 --> 41:22.900
where the capitalist class still monopolizes, you know, much of the material condition, the land,

41:22.900 --> 41:30.260
the soil, the waters, the technology, et cetera, et cetera, money is both a way of guaranteeing

41:30.260 --> 41:39.460
some reproduction and also sucking wealth away from the capitalists. Obviously, that struggle

41:39.460 --> 41:45.060
is not the struggle that is going. It's a struggle that is necessary, but it's also a

41:45.060 --> 41:52.340
struggle that has to be accompanied by many, many, many other, you know, struggles. It's not this,

41:52.340 --> 42:01.460
the main road, you know, to revolution. But we cannot say, and I used to, my response to people

42:01.460 --> 42:06.980
who were critical of wages for households was to say, well, very good. Give up your wage. You are

42:06.980 --> 42:14.180
teaching a university. Give up your wage. Liberate yourself from this bondage to capitalism. Work

42:14.180 --> 42:20.260
for free. Of course, nobody has done that. Of course, you've been conceivable, you know. So,

42:20.260 --> 42:26.980
I found the hypocrisy, the double standard. You know, I found that, you know, once again, yes,

42:27.620 --> 42:34.340
you know, women's work in the home is treated as something very different. And no matter how much

42:34.340 --> 42:42.340
you show that is the foundation for every labor activity, that is work that is exploited by

42:42.340 --> 42:48.740
capital, is work that produces accumulation, creates work, blah, blah, blah, blah, etc. And

42:48.740 --> 42:56.180
that has put women in the condition of, you know, having to accept any wage once they went out of

42:57.060 --> 43:05.060
home. So, I think the money, you know, there is a phase of struggle. And that phase of struggle,

43:05.700 --> 43:12.500
the goal of it is to change the poverty relation and reappropriate. So, to me, the goal of our

43:12.500 --> 43:22.180
struggling every, every moment, every place, every moment is reappropriate, you know, the wealth

43:22.660 --> 43:28.580
that has been produced, the wealth that we are producing, you know, control, I mean, land,

43:28.580 --> 43:35.060
the issue of land, millions of people, land, land, land, land means everything. Land means trees,

43:35.620 --> 43:43.060
land means waters, you know, land means, you know, leaves, medical roots,

43:43.860 --> 43:51.060
land has such, is such wealth that when you lose your wealth, land, you lose much more than

43:52.020 --> 43:58.900
physical sustenance, you lose a culture, you lose knowledges, you lose a tremendous amount of

43:58.900 --> 44:07.460
knowledge when you lose the land. So, that process, you know, and I think in terms of

44:07.460 --> 44:14.500
a future society, you know, in terms of, I think of a society without money or with money,

44:15.460 --> 44:23.540
but money, see, that's the issue. What is money? And I'm thinking, I'm now, this is the issue of

44:23.540 --> 44:28.100
money is really matching my mind because I'm really interested in the relation between women

44:28.100 --> 44:36.980
and money. You know, what has been historically women? Yeah. And, you know, I have this book in

44:36.980 --> 44:44.580
mind, which is called Women, Money and the Devil, that, you know, begins with the pact on the devil

44:44.580 --> 44:51.060
between the witch and, you know, the devil gives her money. And then of course she, she's desperate,

44:51.700 --> 44:58.980
you know, and she's, you know, screaming to her misery, he comes, give us some money.

44:59.540 --> 45:06.020
And eventually, of course, has become my servant, I'll solve your problem. It's a very marital deal,

45:06.100 --> 45:16.260
totally marital. And then she copulates with him. But within a few days, the money has given her

45:16.260 --> 45:23.700
turns into ashes. This has intrigued me. In many demonologies, you find that detail.

45:24.500 --> 45:31.780
And this has intrigued me immensely. Why? Even once they made the pact, even when they sold their soul,

45:32.660 --> 45:40.420
women could not keep the money. Even when they sold their soul, capitalism has instituted this

45:40.420 --> 45:48.580
incredible incompatibility between women and money. But aside from this, money has existed. I

45:48.580 --> 45:56.260
visited many years ago with my partner, we visited the first place in Turkey. And right now I don't

45:56.260 --> 46:02.980
have the, I don't remember the name. Yeah, but it's a famous place, but 3000 years ago,

46:03.540 --> 46:11.380
the first coins were minted. 3000 years ago. But money had a very different function

46:11.940 --> 46:21.140
than capitalist money. Money had ceremonial function, money sometimes served, so you didn't

46:21.140 --> 46:29.780
want to bring, to move cattle, et cetera, et cetera. So you'd use the money as a substitute

46:29.780 --> 46:38.340
for the transportation of goods. But money is different in capitalism and begins to function

46:38.340 --> 46:49.300
capitalistically only when you have a society where people have been expropriated from the

46:49.300 --> 46:54.740
capacity to reproduce themselves. At that moment, money function a different way,

46:55.700 --> 47:03.460
right? At that moment, money is not just exchange. Money becomes an instrument of exploitation.

47:03.460 --> 47:09.780
It becomes an instrument of, because then those people can be forced to work,

47:10.500 --> 47:16.980
can be forced because their sustenance belongs to them. The moment that whatever allowed you to

47:16.980 --> 47:25.300
survive is sucked away from you, then money becomes really the way that basically takes your

47:25.300 --> 47:31.860
blood away, can take your blood and your life away. So I think it's very important. So when we say

47:31.860 --> 47:37.300
there will be a future without money, maybe there will be money, but we will be functioning in a

47:37.300 --> 47:42.900
very, very different way. Maybe it will be like maybe a token that you go to a movie theater

47:42.900 --> 47:49.060
and you have a token that you show and with that token you enter the, you know,

47:49.060 --> 47:57.460
you can enter, gives you the right to enter it. But I agree with Mark's view that the last,

47:58.260 --> 48:06.980
you know, communism as from each according to their ability and to each according to their need

48:07.700 --> 48:15.460
and decision made by the association of the community. That to me, it's a good model to look

48:15.460 --> 48:22.500
at and what could be a money, but certainly not money. Money will not be able to function

48:22.500 --> 48:29.700
because it will be a society in which the wealth, the material condition of reproduction

48:30.340 --> 48:33.620
will be accessible to everybody in the community.

48:36.340 --> 48:44.660
And that's the basis of democracy. A democracy without that access is nothing. It's a world as

48:44.660 --> 48:50.340
it has become. Today the market, you know, the big democracy of the United States, we have people

48:50.340 --> 48:57.940
sleeping in the street, you know, where you have, you know, pharmaceutical companies, you know, who

48:57.940 --> 49:05.380
have killed the millions of people with this, you know, narcotic medicine and so on, you know,

49:05.380 --> 49:12.580
can go scoff free by paying a few, a billion dollars and are not held to the same standard,

49:12.580 --> 49:20.420
you know. So you can go to jail for 20 years, you know, for a little theft, but you have big companies

49:20.420 --> 49:24.820
who are devastating the life of people. So that's not democracy.

49:24.820 --> 49:34.180
I just wanted to maybe clear up a form of misunderstanding that might be in place,

49:34.180 --> 49:39.460
because I just wanted to state that I'm absolutely with you that within a, like,

49:39.460 --> 49:46.900
let's say early transition phase or within the immediate future, it's of course necessary to

49:46.900 --> 49:53.860
fight for higher wages and not kind of dismiss money as something that we would not need in order

49:53.860 --> 50:00.740
to live within the context that we live in right now. The thing is that within these models that

50:00.740 --> 50:07.780
I study, these models for democratic economic planning, they argue that even though a situation

50:07.780 --> 50:15.060
is already in place in which there is democratic control over the economy, that still then there

50:15.060 --> 50:22.980
would need to be some form of connection between work and pay in place in order to, let's say,

50:22.980 --> 50:29.780
discipline its subjects, at least for a certain period of time, because it is assumed that this

50:29.780 --> 50:37.700
would still need to be necessary, actually at the end, for reasons of efficiency, so to speak,

50:37.700 --> 50:45.860
you know. So in order to be able to reproduce a certain type of wealth in material terms,

50:45.860 --> 50:51.300
it would still be necessary to, you know, have these mechanisms in place. And that's why I said

50:51.300 --> 50:57.540
there is a connection between this idea of a two-phase model and this idea of progress,

50:57.540 --> 51:04.900
because then the argument is essentially we do not yet have enough capacity when it comes to

51:04.900 --> 51:12.260
the forces of production in order to have full communism. And until then, we would need to kind

51:12.260 --> 51:18.340
of discipline our subjects in order to get to this place of fully developed forces of production.

51:18.340 --> 51:23.140
And that's why I meant that there is a certain connection between the two ideas, you know.

51:23.140 --> 51:32.820
I understand, but I'm very suspicious of the discipline. Who's going to do the discipline?

51:32.820 --> 51:42.500
Who's going to be disciplined? So that to me, that plan, that democratic planning is not something

51:42.580 --> 51:50.180
that I would, you know, sign up for, because when I hear discipline, all my, you know,

51:51.140 --> 52:00.020
practice say run for the gun when you hear these words, because very dangerous. This sounds like

52:00.020 --> 52:06.980
capitalism. You need to actually whip people to work, decide who's valuable, who's not valuable,

52:07.620 --> 52:17.140
and reproduce, you know, the whole mark, as Mark should say, the hierarchies, the control system,

52:17.140 --> 52:21.620
the two-tier society. That's exactly what we are fighting against.

52:22.660 --> 52:27.300
Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I think the people developing these models, they would, of course,

52:27.300 --> 52:34.100
argue that there is a base income for everybody. And on top of that, you would have these

52:34.100 --> 52:40.980
remuneration schemes that would allow to, as I said, kind of discipline its subjects.

52:41.620 --> 52:48.420
I think they wouldn't call it disciplining. In my eyes, it is still disciplining, and I'm against

52:48.420 --> 52:56.260
this kind of approach, but I just have to be fair in terms of showcasing their arguments for that.

52:56.260 --> 53:01.780
And there's another argument that maybe complicates the whole thing a bit more,

53:01.780 --> 53:07.460
and this argument is actually coming from a feminist perspective, in which the argument

53:07.460 --> 53:16.260
goes that within a totally voluntarist societal organization, there might be a danger of running

53:16.260 --> 53:25.380
into a situation where, again, people who are most vulnerable are kind of having a worse situation

53:26.020 --> 53:31.300
when trying to organize this reproduction of societies. In this feminist critique,

53:31.300 --> 53:37.620
I think the argument would be that the transparency that comes along with forms of remuneration and a

53:38.580 --> 53:46.020
general obligation to work is seen as a guard against a continuation of unjust relations

53:46.020 --> 53:51.220
in the sphere of reproduction within post-capitalist configurations. So this would be,

53:51.220 --> 53:53.620
I think, the argument. I don't see anything

53:53.620 --> 53:57.940
voluntaristic in what I'm talking about. I'm not seeing anything. I'm seeing a transformation

53:57.940 --> 54:03.460
of social relation that occurs in the process of the struggle. I mean, look, if we want to look,

54:03.460 --> 54:10.180
for instance, at societies that are running now on a more communal system, right? I mean, yeah,

54:12.820 --> 54:18.900
look, there is a Guatemalan-taken feminist who has written a very beautiful book,

54:18.900 --> 54:27.060
Gladys Tsutsun, where she discusses what has been the history and the organization

54:27.060 --> 54:35.540
of communal work, society, of Totonicapan, which is in the Highlands of Guatemala.

54:36.260 --> 54:41.860
And she describes a situation where there is a culture, there is a collective agreement.

54:41.860 --> 54:47.140
Collective agreement, because it's stipulated through assemblies, is the assembly. The assembly

54:47.140 --> 54:52.580
is the whole. You make the decision, but you have to contribute to the reproduction of the society.

54:53.140 --> 54:59.780
So you may call that disciplining, but the fact is that you cannot, if you don't actually,

54:59.780 --> 55:06.260
there is a general agreement that in order to keep the society going, something, you know,

55:06.260 --> 55:11.780
you have a little responsibility, you have to do something, you know? And even if you migrate,

55:12.340 --> 55:18.340
even if you migrate, you have to have something. And even when you return as a migrant after many

55:18.340 --> 55:23.700
years, you can return as a tourist or you can return as a participant. Participating means that

55:23.700 --> 55:30.100
you begin to take responsibility again. That seems to me very, very fair, very democratic.

55:30.900 --> 55:36.660
By the time you are a child, nine or 10, there's little things that you're given to do, and you're

55:36.660 --> 55:43.140
understood that you're part of a collective and you have to do, etc. That seems to me as nothing

55:43.140 --> 55:50.500
voluntaristic. There is nothing voluntaristic. It's a collective decision-making on the basis,

55:51.060 --> 55:57.780
calculated on the basis of the resources that are available, not out of some imagination,

55:57.780 --> 56:05.060
but on the basis of this is like a high mounting place, but where there is a culture of collectivity

56:05.780 --> 56:12.020
and is a culture that gives a tremendous protection. You're not born in, you know,

56:12.020 --> 56:18.820
that the community will support you and where there's an immense solidarity also with the

56:18.820 --> 56:24.420
people who die. You know, the dead, there is a cult of the dead, the dead are present.

56:24.980 --> 56:30.580
You know, as soon as somebody dies, there's enormous amount she described by everybody. So

56:30.580 --> 56:37.540
the death is not as fear as the end. The sense of belonging to something is something that you

56:37.540 --> 56:45.700
understand, extend your life beyond your physical life, which is a great sense of power. Instead of

56:45.700 --> 56:52.340
the sense of desperation and finitude, thinking, oh my God, all is lost, because you are actually

56:52.340 --> 56:57.060
part of a collective body. You're beginning to feel that there's a collective breath and a

56:57.060 --> 57:04.900
collective body, very powerful. And, but there are, you know, from the very early age, the idea

57:04.900 --> 57:09.860
that, yeah, you have to do something. And if you don't, if you don't do anything, then you should

57:09.860 --> 57:14.420
not make the decision. You don't speak in the assembly unless you've done the work. I think

57:14.420 --> 57:20.740
it's a great idea, by the way. I think it's a great idea that we should use and it's not

57:20.740 --> 57:28.260
voluntaristic. Yeah, I understand. And, but would you say then that this is always tightly coupled

57:28.260 --> 57:38.260
to a contextual idea of community? Because this agreement, so to speak, is more or less based on

57:38.260 --> 57:47.300
rules that are part of a cultural socialization, so to speak. And do you think that this can be

57:48.020 --> 57:56.180
achieved in larger context as well, or in a really large scale context as well? Or does it need to be

57:56.740 --> 58:06.340
kind of more or less tied to a community that has a certain size and is therefore able to,

58:07.060 --> 58:14.020
let's say, put practice behind this ideal so that it is not just an abstract rule?

58:14.660 --> 58:19.380
Yeah, but this is the idea, right? First of all, I think there's a struggle also in these

58:19.380 --> 58:24.260
indigenous communities, and what I understand talking to women from indigenous communities,

58:24.260 --> 58:31.220
to expand the community so that, for example, people who are not being raised in that culture

58:31.220 --> 58:38.980
can also be part of it, for example, through marriage and other forms. And so these communities

58:38.980 --> 58:46.980
are not frozen. And I think that the women are, in fact, the most important agent of change.

58:48.020 --> 58:55.540
But this goes back to the idea of how to be organized, because if we are talking about real

58:55.540 --> 59:02.900
democracy and people making decisions about their life, then there has to be a certain rootedness

59:02.900 --> 59:09.060
in the sense that you have to know your locality. You have to know the possibilities.

59:09.060 --> 59:14.500
You cannot make decisions for places far away for the fishermen when you are in the mountain.

59:15.060 --> 59:22.020
So the idea of the Confederacy, the idea of exchanges, the idea of, you know, what I was

59:22.020 --> 59:29.700
talking before, you know, the assembly might be a thousand people, but then you connect with the

59:29.700 --> 59:36.500
assembly right all across the highlands of Guatemala. It doesn't mean that because,

59:37.220 --> 59:43.300
you know, you have a decision making by a community which is somewhat limited in size

59:44.260 --> 59:56.580
and has commitment that relate to all kinds of decision and cultural practices that date from,

59:57.220 --> 01:00:05.620
doesn't mean that you don't also open to other similar communities and that you don't have

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:12.420
exchanges. The question is when you begin to have a decision making that is removed

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:19.780
from the people who are actually suffering the consequences of that decision making.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:27.300
And here we cannot have it two ways. If you want to be in control of the consequences

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:34.020
of decision making, then you cannot make decisions on a global level. I cannot decide for people in

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:42.260
Patagonia. I cannot make decisions for people that cry. I can struggle with them when they ask me

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:49.620
solidarity to fight against fracking in Patagonia. I can struggle with them, but I cannot make

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:55.460
decisions for the people in Patagonia. And we don't have got to go as far as Patagonia, but I mean,

01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:04.660
I cannot make decisions for people in Colorado or in Alabama, right? But I can struggle with them

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:11.300
because obviously we'll have similar conditions, et cetera, et cetera. And we have those agreements.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:17.220
So I think that this is what we have. And of course, back to the original point,

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:23.300
that the struggle is the gray field of experimentation and the gray field of

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:29.460
transformation. This change to this new society, to a society where we have this culture, where

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:36.020
we have this commitment, where we have this solidarity, it's going to be a tremendous

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:43.220
process of transformation. We all carry a lot of capitalism within ourselves. The struggle does

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:49.140
not only transform the world, but has to transform who we are. There's one question I ask all of my

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.500
guests at the end, and this is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:03.860
What is the alternative? I have to be joyful. I have to be joyful because I'm like, you know,

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:15.460
I often quote a poem, a poet from Greece, 1300 BC, 1000, Mimmo Nermo. He wrote something that I

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:24.900
learned as a, you know, a young person and stayed with me. Life is a tragedy, it's a comedy or a

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:34.180
tragedy. And you either learn to laugh of the most great sufferings, or you'll forever cry.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:43.860
You know, and it's not laugh, but it's an affirmation of life. It's an affirmation of life.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:52.100
And here I want to end quoting Maria Mies, quoting Maria Mies, my great sister who died,

01:02:52.740 --> 01:03:00.340
and it's been a great pain to lose her. And she used to tell the story, she was full of life,

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:08.900
life-affirming person, very creative, very life-affirming. And she used to think of her

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:16.260
mother, who at the end of World War II, when the whole world in Germany, you can imagine,

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:23.380
right, in ruin, in front of a life of ruin, she pulled up her sleeves and, you know,

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:30.740
this was a peasant community and bought a few piglets and said, well, life has to go on,

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:40.660
I still have to feed my children. And this, you know, in Ecofeminism, a book that she wrote

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:47.460
with Vandana Shiva, in the introduction to it, you know, there is a beautiful, beautiful sentence

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:53.060
that I almost memorize, I see if I can, you know, it says that when in this world,

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:59.460
in this world of capitalism, that is devoted, seems to be devoted to the destruction,

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:08.180
to such a destruction of nature and human life, our world can be summed up in terms of a struggle,

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:15.220
you know, to nourish, to nourish the impulse, the great impulse, which is in every living thing,

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:20.100
which is the impulse to reproduce themselves, which is in how to live, to continue.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:30.340
And this is what, you know, I, this is what makes me, makes me, gives me joy, is to see

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:38.020
that we have to start with what is living, with what is moving, with what the new children are

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:45.380
born every day. What do we say to them? Oh, too late, too late. Capitalism is destroyed

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:51.620
too much, but they are born now. So we have to give them something. Wonderful. Sylvia,

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:56.820
