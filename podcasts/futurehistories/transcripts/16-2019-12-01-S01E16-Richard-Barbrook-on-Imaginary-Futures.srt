00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Welcome to Future Histories.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,780
My name is Jan Gross, and my guest today is Richard Barbrook, who is, amongst

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,320
other things, known for coining the term Californian ideology as an early critique

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,720
of Silicon Valley techno-determinism.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,300
He and Andy Cameron wrote their influential essay on the subject in 1995,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,780
and the topic is as prevalent as ever.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,620
I met Richard at the 10-year anniversary of the techno-politics

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,300
research group here in Vienna.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,660
So shout outs to them as well.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,820
Another person whom I was happy to meet again there is Jaya Clara Brecke,

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,100
my guest in episode six, which was, up until now, the one episode in this

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,760
podcast that I did in English.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,400
So if you're not fluent in German, but indeed love future histories, then please

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,100
go and check out episode six with Jaya.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,300
And whatever language you actually speak, if you like the show, then please

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,060

slash future histories.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,220
Marianne and Paula recently did just that.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,020
And I want to send my warmest thanks to them for doing so, but now please

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,340
enjoy today's episode with Richard Barbrook.

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,940
Richard, you have done so many different things.

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,540
I think it's easier if you introduce yourself.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,060
Well, I teach politics at the University of Westminster in London, and I'm a

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,380
founder member of Class War Games, and we also run a cooperative called

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,460
Digital Liberties that makes games.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,180
And I was sitting outside a cafe in Vienna and someone came up to talk to me,

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,740
who I thought might be begging for money.

28
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,740
But then I realized he actually did, because I'd never met the guy before.

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,180
And he said, you are the person who wrote the Californian ideology.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,820
And I said, yep, that is true.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,620
So that's the other thing I'm well known for.

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,100
That was in 1995, where we critiqued.com neoliberalism before its time.

33
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:16,700
And hopefully starting a process that will eventually lead into

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,380
different kinds of futures.

35
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,460
Ah, yes.

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,420
Well, it's one of the reasons I got interested in futures, like writing

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,380
histories of the future.

38
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,660
I wrote a book called Imaginary Futures, which is the start of the first chapter

39
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,780
that says the future is what it used to be.

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,900
So things like, you know, predictions of artificial intelligence or, you

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,420
know, fusion power or space tourism.

42
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,020
They've been around since at least the 1960s, and they come back with a

43
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,220
regularity, which is quite extraordinary.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,060
And of course, the information society, we're always about to transition from

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,700
industrial capitalism to some sort of digital utopia.

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,020
And again, that goes back to at least the 1960s, or in its Russian

47
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,100
original version, the 1950s.

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,500
One point you're making is actually that there is this repetition of futures

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,020
actually, and you pledge us to invent new imaginaries of futures.

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,780
So why do we need these new imaginaries of future?

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,620
Well, I think the reason is because, I mean, I've just been to visit the

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,300
Red Vienna Exhibition, which everybody should go and see next to the Rathaus.

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,340
And that's an interest.

54
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,340
That's interesting because they had a very clear vision of the future.

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,620
So people in Vienna before the First World War had terrible housing and bad

56
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,980
health care and really poor education.

57
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,700
And so to raise the mass of the population up, they had a vision of a sort of social

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,940
democratic transition to communism.

59
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,620
And what you need to do is have a healthy, educated and well-housed proletariat.

60
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,820
And then they went and did it.

61
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,460
And it's quite extraordinary achievement.

62
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,460
And present day Vienna still benefits from that attempt.

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,940
And that's that's an example of if the left needs a way of thinking about a future,

64
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,780
because if you know, when you start doing things now, they're like a beta version of

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,660
what's going to come up, come eventually.

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,340
And so if you don't have that idea of an imaginary future, you're in a bit of a

67
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,980
problem because the right does have an imaginary future.

68
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,580
It has a sort of neoliberal dystopian, but in Britain, it's called Brexit.

69
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,940
You know, so you turn yourself into a sort of fantasy version of America, basically.

70
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,980
Or even worse, a native nationalism.

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
Well, that is partly America, yes, of course.

72
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,100
I can live there.

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,220
No, no, I went to school in America where they used to make them all pledge allegiance

74
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,940
to the flag every morning, which is a little English person I thought was very weird.

75
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,100
So, you know, they have to inculcate a nation, a multinational country and

76
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,940
homogenize them into one thing called Americans.

77
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,100
So how could these like really radically different imaginaries, imaginary futures

78
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,860
look like? Because, I mean, there's social democracy, but we kind of had that.

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,020
And it's at the end, I mean, at least in the way it has been done, like the

80
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:24,620
last 40, 50 years, it has always been a, like a compromise between a social

81
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,060
welfare state and a capital market.

82
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,620
I met an English guy who was living here on the, in the exhibition, who was

83
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,580
lecturing me about the awfulness of British politics because you don't want

84
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,140
to compromise, and I was saying, well, you can't compromise, that's the problem.

85
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,140
Yeah, you've had that advantage that the, I was told by an Austrian of the post

86
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,900
war generation who said the socialists and the Christian Democrats learned to

87
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,540
compromise in the concentration camp.

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,860
So, yeah, you've had that built into the system because of the trauma of the

89
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,620
civil war and the Nazi occupation and all the rest of it, and the second war,

90
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,540
and that you, which you lost, it went badly.

91
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,620
But the, but the, the imaginaries that you are calling for, they are aiming for

92
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,020
something different, for something more, actually.

93
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,540
Exactly.

94
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,340
What does it look like?

95
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,900
I mean, if you went to Britain today and showed them red Vienna, that would look

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,020
like an imaginary future, you know, 60% social housing, really good welfare

97
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,820
services, you know, okay, it's a very paternalistic vision of social

98
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,980
democracy, but nonetheless, compared to lots of places in England today, and

99
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,660
especially in America, it would seem even more utopian.

100
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,980
So that, that sort of vision I agree with, he does seem data, though, of course, if

101
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,260
you're Chinese, it seems like the future, of course, they are building social

102
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,500
housing on a massive scale and all this sort of stuff and adding digital

103
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,540
technology to it.

104
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,980
And they do think that they're going to build communism in 30 or 40 years.

105
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,260
As I, oh, yes, I met somebody from a party school in Beijing, who confidently

106
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,740
predicted that they would be there in 50 years.

107
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,260
And I said, if I come back in 20 years time, it'll still be 50 years away,

108
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,700
won't it?

109
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,660
To me, it doesn't look that way.

110
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,100
I mean, they are actually more going to a, like engineered capitalism, no?

111
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,420
Confucian socialism, as Daniel Bell's son calls it.

112
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,140
Oh, right.

113
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,820
That's the term.

114
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,260
I see.

115
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,020
Well, it's got a sort of, you know, particularly they've had a long tradition

116
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,900
for a thousand, well, I think Confucius is two and a half thousand years ago.

117
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,580
This vision that you have an enlightened elite who look after the people.

118
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,380
So, but it's really comes from the Han dynasty, doesn't it?

119
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,260
It's like 1000, 500 years ago, whatever.

120
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,180
Sorry.

121
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,700
What's the, the future that you are imagining?

122
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,620
I think it's, I think we should, I said, I think we should think the

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,140
Pali is a reassertion though of the old socialist future.

124
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,140
I think that is an important part of it.

125
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,820
It's interesting that one of the things that I found with continentals and they

126
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,700
think what's happened in the Labour Party recently is they find quite the strange

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,220
is this reassertion of socialist iconography.

128
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,180
So if you think of something like Podemos in Spain, they got rid of the red flag

129
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,020
and the international and all this sort of stuff.

130
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,340
Whereas in England, that scene is quite important to reassert that continuity

131
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,900
with working class history, you know, back to, I mean, obviously England's

132
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,140
had a long tradition, long history of working class struggle back to

133
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,220
the early 19th century.

134
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,260
So, you know, an interesting thing is, so one of the things are, which would be

135
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,180
seen as an imaginary future or a vision of the future is the Labour Party had a

136
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,220
conference about 18 months ago called alternative models of ownership where

137
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,500
you know, obviously the neo, the neoliberal model has failed, privatisation,

138
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,740
deregulation.

139
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,220
And so how do you replace that?

140
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,700
One thing is that go back to the old state capitalist nationalised industries.

141
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,380
That seems not a good idea.

142
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,860
So the alternative models of ownership is to look at things like municipal

143
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,300
ownership, obviously what a lot of red Vienna would be quite inspiring, but also

144
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,620
particularly cooperatives, you know, cooperatives were developed in mid 19th

145
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,860
century England, consumer co-ops, housing cooperatives and producer cooperatives.

146
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,740
And so if you look at places like Preston, which is the city in the north of

147
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,500
England, the local council has actually started to develop local cooperative

148
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,140
economy, partly to keep money, money, you know, when they private, previous

149
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,300
councils privatised services, money was being taken out of the local economy by

150
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,220
the privatised providers of services.

151
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,900
If you hand them over to cooperatives, the money tends to stay within the local

152
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,980
institutions. And this is now seen as a model for creating a new type of

153
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,940
socialism that's based on not just replacing private managers with state

154
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,260
managers, but actually to democratise the economy.

155
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,900
And this comes back to a lot of thought that was done, a critiques actually of

156
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,620
the old type state system that, you know, that they trusted managers and people who

157
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,300
were, you know, basically white collar, this was a paternalistic, this would be

158
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,820
the downside of the red Vienna model, this very paternalistic view.

159
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,060
But if you've got an educated workforce, they ought to be able to run the system

160
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,740
themselves. You know, who knows how best to run a railway, John McDonnell, who's

161
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,380
the finance spokesman of the Labour Party.

162
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,620
And he would say, well, who knows how best to run a railway, not the managers, it's

163
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,140
the people who drive the trains, maintain the tracks, look after the stations.

164
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,380
They know how to run the railway.

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,420
So what you have to do is get what they often call their tacit knowledge about the

166
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,860
system and get an input that into running things.

167
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,060
And I think that's an interesting vision, because actually that is a new modern

168
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,180
vision, particularly if you couple it with digital technologies, you know, using a

169
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,620
lot of the stuff that we do in everyday life with social media and polling and all

170
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,580
the other stuff that you can do and allow people to pass, you know, not just to turn

171
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,060
up to meetings, but to contribute knowledge in other ways and to be consulted.

172
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,180
But actually, also, it's going back to the middle of the 19th century.

173
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,380
This is what English socialism was about, actually, before the First World War.

174
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:44,140
So if you read Karl Marx, who's the German theorist of English socialism in

175
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,180
volume three of Capital, he said, what's the what's the future?

176
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,100
It's actually not the state ownership of everything.

177
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,820
It's the cooperative ownership of everything.

178
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,620
He's quite explicit about that.

179
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,460
And that comes from that experience.

180
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,700
So that's a good example where, in a sense, you have to look back at old

181
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,100
versions of the future and then think about how they can be redesigned and

182
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,900
inspire us to think about how do we create a new version?

183
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Because obviously, the problems we're facing are some ways the same, you know,

184
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,420
capitalist alienation and exploitation, in some senses, have intensified.

185
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,540
But on the other hand, they're very different because we have a very

186
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:25,180
different workforce, for instance, much more ethnically diverse gender.

187
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,540
All these other issues have to go into it.

188
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,220
And I think crucially, it's much, much better educated.

189
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,780
So if you have a better educated workforce, more skilled, it's going to

190
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,220
think about how it wants to run its own life in a very different way than

191
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,700
people who are desperate, who are very happy if people provide them with

192
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,620
housing and education and healthcare and all the rest of it, particularly if

193
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,740
it's done by a very enlightened leadership.

194
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,220
Now, I think people feel that they want to say in all this, in a real say as well,

195
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,700
not just ticking boxes.

196
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,140
So that means the transition would actually start in the here and now by

197
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,740
establishing work-owned cooperatives that serve as practical examples for

198
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,900
this kind of economic structure.

199
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,180
But there would still be a market mechanism that is in place in between

200
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,340
the different cooperatives.

201
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,940
Is that just a transitional phase or is it also, what about markets?

202
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:36,100
Are they a part of the structure that you are aiming for?

203
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,500
Is it like market socialism or will there be a transition that, for example,

204
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,660
involves abolishing money and the commodity?

205
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,060
Abolishing the commodity labor power, the ultimate appeal.

206
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,820
We used to read this book by a guy called Jan Appel called Communist

207
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,740
Production and Distribution, which I finally managed to get a copy of at the

208
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,540
Anarchist Book Fair a few years ago.

209
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,620
And that's quite interesting re-looking at that because he was a Dutch council

210
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:18,180
communist, so he was writing, must have been in the late 20s, early 1930s.

211
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,700
And it's how do you do that?

212
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,500
It's really interesting.

213
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,420
How would you do that?

214
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,420
If you actually wanted to get rid of money, and it's always been this conundrum.

215
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,980
I mean, Robert Owen, who's the founder of English socialism, thought you could just

216
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,900
replace gold pieces with labor notes.

217
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,580
You know, you do one hour of this and one hour of that and you just swap the note.

218
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,740
But as Marks points out in the introduction to Gundersen, what happens is

219
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,700
that the labor note slowly turns into money and becomes the regulator and

220
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,060
commodifies the labor.

221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,100
Yeah, and so that he has this really interesting problem.

222
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,580
And you think now, of course, with digital technologies, a lot of this sort of state

223
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,020
planning, which went massively out of fashion after the collapse of the Soviet

224
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,900
Union, suddenly it seems a lot more rational.

225
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,380
You know, I wrote about the invention of the internet in America, where they

226
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,820
pumped huge amounts of money in the 1960s to invent this very esoteric computer

227
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,060
network because they were terrified that the Soviet Union was doing it.

228
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,300
And one of the reasons the Soviet Union wants it is because they had the idea

229
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,620
that they could replace the state plan with a giant mainframe that would

230
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,380
instantly, you know, you go into a shop and buy red socks and it would send back

231
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,940
a message to the sock factory saying, produce more socks in this size than the

232
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,660
color red.

233
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,260
And of course, this seemed incredibly utopian then, but now any pre-supermarket

234
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,340
does it with barcodes.

235
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,100
And it's a debate that is being revived, actually.

236
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,140
I mean, there's this book, The People's Republic of Walmart by Leith Phillips and

237
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,340
Mark Michael Roswowski.

238
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,940
Well, it also goes back to the people that there's been a really renewed interest

239
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,140
in what happened in Chile with Stafford Beer and Cybersyn, I've met Raul Espejo.

240
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,500
There's this very brilliant, brilliant book by Eden Medina, which is called

241
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,380
Cybernetic Revolution, it was originally going to be called Cybernetic Socialism,

242
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,940
but surprise surprise, MIT Press quickly changed the title, which is interesting

243
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,380
because in a way they weren't revolutionaries, they were much more

244
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,060
socialist.

245
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,740
But again, in America, I guess words mean certain things, don't they?

246
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,780
And that's also interesting where, you know, they're using like one mainframe

247
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,500
Intellics machines, though the control room looks very good where you have all

248
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,180
these guys at the top, they're basically the guys who are coordinating the

249
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,180
distribution information, it's not really a top-down thing, it's a sort of

250
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,940
coordination.

251
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,620
And they all have these wonderful 70s chairs and they have a space for their

252
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,420
glass of whiskey and cigars, like a sort of gentleman's club.

253
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,340
Stafford Beer obviously thought there was nothing too good for the workers.

254
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,460
So that's, I think, interesting.

255
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,580
So there's that, yeah, there's that.

256
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,340
And obviously, the other thing that people don't talk about, but I think is

257
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,060
the real big thing, is China, because they still have state planning on a

258
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,980
massive scale.

259
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,580
And one of the, you know, it's the fastest growing economy in world history.

260
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,100
It is the great transformation of our generation is China in the last 70 years

261
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,300
and particularly in the last 30, 40 years.

262
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,900
I mean, and state planning is absolutely at the core of this process.

263
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,660
Yeah.

264
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,580
Well, but I think that the general argument from the other side would then

265
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,820
be to say, well, it might be that they still are dominant in terms of planning,

266
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,420
but just after they opened their market to a capitalist market logic of competition

267
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:53,140
and for-profit production, they made this like huge jump and that this would

268
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:59,540
actually underline the effectiveness of markets and for-profit motive.

269
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,420
On the flight here, I think it's called China Daily or something, I got a copy

270
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,500
of and it's interesting because they're talking about the 70th anniversary and

271
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,820
they quite correctly point out, you see, you couldn't have had that leap without

272
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,620
the previous Mao period where they increased the lifespan of the population

273
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,780
from the average age was 35 and it increased to 64 under Mao's reign.

274
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,620
I mean, extraordinary education, health, that, you know, to actually have those

275
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,660
people who were ready to make that transition.

276
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,060
And that's how you can't really disentangle one from the other.

277
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,820
I think that, I think a lot of historians now have started to get away from that

278
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,980
ideological debate.

279
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,060
I think for us, obviously, we find talking about red Vienna, isn't it?

280
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,060
It's one, it's an interesting historical example, but we're, we're faced with

281
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,620
very different problems, I think.

282
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,060
And I think what the question you ask is correct, which is, you know, we, you

283
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,620
know, you can take some mixture of the plan and the market and you can massively

284
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,540
raise living standards and you could, you know, in England, you know, we could build

285
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,660
2 million social housing.

286
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,260
We could lower people's housing costs massively if we essentially reversed what

287
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,100
Thatcher and her successors did, which is sell off housing and now a huge bubble to

288
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,020
take place and all the rest of it.

289
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,660
That's possible.

290
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,020
We know how you can do that and you can do it with even within the capitalist

291
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,500
system.

292
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,500
The question then is, but how do we move beyond that?

293
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,980
Because a lot of the problems people have, I mean, a great example is mental

294
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,540
health, for instance, is to do with the stress of living under this capitalist

295
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,620
society, causing record level of depression and, you know, various other

296
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,500
ailments.

297
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,500
And that is to do because people don't live, they live in socially alienated

298
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,460
lives, meaningless lives, they think.

299
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,900
And so you need to create that again.

300
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,620
That's a, that's a sort of different level of problems, isn't it?

301
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,180
Yeah, definitely.

302
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,420
And I think that the problem then lies at the end.

303
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,180
If you go down the rabbit hole, it lies within the question of political economy

304
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,860
and that's where you figure it in the DNA, you know, in the DNA of the political

305
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,460
economy.

306
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,420
Well, of course, I mean, cause you know, a lot of political economy was, had those

307
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,140
questions and then they very deliberately in the academic system split them in

308
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
half politics.

309
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,100
I mean, I teach politics and then there's another profession called economics.

310
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,260
And it's interesting that you could, you know, you could spend three years at a

311
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,900
university doing a politics degree and know nothing about economics, but how you

312
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,420
could talk about the modern state without it being a class state or, you know,

313
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,780
bureaucratic state or, you know, all these other things that it's like that

314
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,260
because of this transformation that took place when we were where we moved from

315
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,460
feudalism to capitalism, however you put it, you know, whatever that means.

316
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,460
But, you know, the difference between a medieval way people produce wealth, as

317
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,660
Adam Smith would say, the wealth of nations, you know, the difference between

318
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,460
that and how we live now is just profound.

319
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,700
And that creates changes in the politics and culture in relation to personal

320
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,380
relationships and all the rest of it.

321
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,940
And so it's extraordinary.

322
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,140
You can do, and then you have economics, which is just like astrology.

323
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,620
It's just a sort of, you know, very complicated mathematics, garbage in,

324
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,900
garbage out basically, you know, and that's not that, you know, the fact that

325
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,180
these, these people are even considered to be academically credible is what I

326
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,380
find extraordinary.

327
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,980
So one of the, one of the tasks at hand, I guess, would be to, to implement profound

328
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,140
change within the economics departments at the universities.

329
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,340
And we can by abolish them, but the statistic, I mean, to be fair, I mean,

330
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,940
obviously in bourgeois economics, as we used to call it, there is very good

331
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,460
statistical work going on, but it's just like the basic ground theory.

332
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,180
The fact that when I was taught a level economics, that's 16, I was 16, I did

333
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,220
economics school and I remember the Trevor Jones was our teacher and the

334
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,980
first lesson of the, of my first year of economics, two years ago, he did the

335
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,180
demand and supply curve on the board and said, it's all wrong, but you have to

336
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,620
learn it to pass the exam.

337
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,220
And it was only many years later when I read Adam Smith and David

338
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,620
Ricard and of course, Karl Marx.

339
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,140
I realized what he meant is like the wrong answer to the wrong question.

340
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,020
And so, so to do something like that, where you have a profession that's,

341
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
who's both basic theory is such an error.

342
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,260
They don't know what a price is and they don't understand how prices are defined

343
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,300
either, so that's a bit problematic when you're studying capitalistic economics.

344
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,060
But that's a, that's a very interesting point because I think that's exactly one

345
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,380
of the points that we need to address because it works as a narrative.

346
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,540
That's an ideology.

347
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,340
Yeah, that's an idea, but it does work.

348
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,060
It also works if you want to collect large amounts of statistical data, because

349
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,180
on the, it talks about the surface forms of capitalism.

350
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,380
So one of its functions is to create large, you know, have large data sets.

351
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,780
And then you can say something about, you know, I don't know what the stock

352
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,580
market is going to be like in a year's time or usually wrongly, but, or, you

353
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,060
know, what the growth rate is, all these sorts of things, but what it can't say

354
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,420
is, you know, why is there a capitalist crisis?

355
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,700
You know, they can't, you know, the most fundamental thing of the last 10 years

356
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,540
has been the implosion of the, near implosion of the financial system and the

357
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,500
really bad policies that were adopted to prop up the world system in the last

358
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,260
decade.

359
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,700
They can't talk about that because they actually don't have the theoretical

360
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,660
tools that allow them to understand it.

361
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,220
And that is really interesting.

362
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,500
And then, but it's not just that.

363
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,860
I don't think it's just the shifting of, you know, economics from politics, but

364
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,820
you know, the way that anthropologies are separate, you know, history is over

365
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,780
here, cultural studies is over, you know, there's a whole series of these, of this

366
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,060
division of labor within intellectual life, which isn't talking to each other.

367
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,340
And then once they say in their little bubble, especially as academics are a

368
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,940
bit like, I don't know, they're a bit like monasteries in the 90s, in the

369
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,060
middle evil period where they're all doing their own, you know, chanting

370
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,780
Latin masses or so the rest of the population are concerned, completely

371
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,940
outside practical engagement in what society is doing, which again is okay

372
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,420
because it's good that they're accumulating knowledge about obscure

373
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,580
things, but it's not being reintegrated back into our society and precisely for

374
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,540
the problem you're talking about.

375
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:55,380
If we want to think about how do we go beyond capitalism, broadly defined, we

376
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,220
actually have to be able to draw on all this human experience and think about how

377
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,020
you do do things like complicated things, like divide and distribute labor,

378
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,500
create social wealth in a way that people don't find alienating, find

379
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,740
fulfilling, have time to look after their children and all the other things.

380
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,940
Having a son, I always think that's the most important thing in life,

381
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,100
because hanging out with him.

382
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:26,460
But could you, could you like briefly sketch how this could be done?

383
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:34,540
Because I mean, if we talk macro level-ish kind of things, and we just

384
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,620
briefly touched the socialist calculation debate and how they...

385
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,380
Well, with the Austrians, you also, it's interesting that this...

386
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,540
Austrian economics, I have to...

387
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,780
You mean Austrian economics or Austrians?

388
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,380
No, the Austrian economics, which was for people who hated Red Vienna.

389
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,260
So you think like Hayek, Mise, Schumpeter to a lesser extent, but basically

390
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,620
they're all, they all hate it.

391
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
You can think Hayek was a snob, wasn't he?

392
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,140
The idea that the proles would actually have decent housing and hang out in

393
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,980
coffee bars was probably his idea of hell.

394
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,260
And he just spent the rest of his life trying to...

395
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,820
It's interesting because the Road to Serfdom, which was Margaret Thatcher's

396
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,900
favorite book, which he wrote in exile in London.

397
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,900
And what he says there is if you set up a national health service,

398
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,300
Britain's probably greatest beloved institution, it's the straight run to

399
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,660
the Gulag Archipelago.

400
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,660
It's a completely batshit crazy book.

401
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,700
I mean, I'm old enough to remember Thatcher being elected.

402
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,860
So I went and read this book because he said this is her favorite book.

403
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,140
So I was going around telling you, I said, this is like Mein Kampf.

404
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,060
This is, you know, read it because this is what she's going to do.

405
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,420
You know, this is craziness.

406
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,180
But she's doing it because they believe in this and they did.

407
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,260
That's exactly what they did.

408
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:00,980
So if we want to go back to actually countering that, we need our own type of

409
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,540
narratives, which again, take things like the socialist calculation debate and say,

410
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,860
well, actually, you were wrong.

411
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,540
You can calculate in different ways, particularly now we've got all this

412
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,340
computing bow that allows us to calculate.

413
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,700
But the question is, what are you calculating and what is the purpose of

414
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,740
this calculation?

415
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,580
Yeah, because otherwise you end up like in Chinese central planning, you know.

416
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:24,820
Exactly.

417
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,500
I guess, I mean, these are two points, I guess.

418
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:35,140
One is that we need to define what we are aiming for in the sense of what's,

419
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,980
what's the purpose, you know, because we agree that the purpose being just profit

420
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,140
is one of the huge problems right now.

421
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,580
So we, we can put in something like a general wellbeing, you know, for

422
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,980
everybody, each individual.

423
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,420
But then there's the question of how to, I mean, but I think that's.

424
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,700
Stafford Beer has a really great idea, which is, you know, you go to, I don't

425
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,460
know, you go to hotels or restaurants or whatever, and they're more like public

426
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,500
transports or things and they have these little smileys which go, I don't know

427
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,820
whether you have them here, they are like dark green, light green, something

428
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,300
on red, whether you're happy or sad and you press them.

429
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,300
And he wanted to actually have them in everybody's home and everybody every

430
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,220
day would vote where they were happy or sad.

431
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,220
So nothing, nothing else, just where they're happy.

432
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,060
And obviously some people will be sad because they're sick or they quarrel

433
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,180
with their partner or something, but he just said all in general that the

434
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,580
government would know every day, whether it was the people were happier than sad.

435
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,500
So you just said the government, that's, that's my, my, my point of entry, I guess,

436
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,180
because I mean.

437
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,500
Well, he was doing it for the Chilean government.

438
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,460
I think my question is just, uh, there's this, um, I do see one of the narratives

439
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,980
popping up that, uh, against the, you know, Austrian, uh, narrative of, uh,

440
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,380
price as being the supreme price and market mechanisms, uh, being the supreme

441
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,260
mechanism of allocation of resources.

442
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,540
You've got the Austro Marxist approach.

443
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,060
And then there's this, I mean, there's the narrative that is popping up right

444
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,900
now, which is kind of, all right.

445
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,620
Um, uh, we can see in, uh, large scale companies like Walmart or Amazon and

446
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,060
anything that, uh, planned economy is possible in general.

447
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:25,860
So let's try this with different, um, uh, uh, goals, of course, you know, not

448
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,420
for profit, but that would imply some kind of, uh, centrally planned economy.

449
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,700
But it, it seems as if what you're promoting is not a centrally planned

450
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,740
economy, but a more decentralized, um,

451
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,860
Well, centralization is inevitable though, in a way, because we're, you

452
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,100
think about the world economy.

453
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,940
It's also slowly going into three zones, China, Europe, and North America.

454
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,140
And these are very large.

455
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,500
Europe is a very large group of people who are all, um, okay.

456
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,580
We might be very, I think we're very diverse, but to outsiders, they

457
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,460
all think we're the same.

458
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,420
I had a Chinese student this year who came up with, she said to me very

459
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,900
soon, she said, I don't understand why the Europeans keep quarreling with each

460
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,180
other.

461
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,420
Why don't you form a strong centralized state?

462
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,180
Like we did.

463
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,100
It's been very successful from which country was China, China.

464
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,820
Ah, okay.

465
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,060
Yeah.

466
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,500
So for that Charles, she's concerned, you know, the last 70 years is the

467
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,420
best in Chinese history.

468
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,340
And it's because they created in 1945 a strong centralized state and it had

469
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,220
driven the country forward into the, you know, whatever, you know, prosperity

470
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,900
media, was it a mediumly prosperous ecological civilization, or whatever

471
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,580
the latest phraseology is.

472
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,500
So, but what would, what would be your

473
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,140
I'm not, I'm not really in favor of Confucian socialism.

474
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,420
Yes.

475
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,820
But what are you in favor?

476
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,100
Well, that's what I'm saying.

477
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,740
I think it's interesting that the, what, uh, from the experiences of, uh, labor,

478
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,540
local governments in the 1980s, which is, you know, the present leadership

479
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,140
lay party comes very much out of the Greater London Council, the GLC, and

480
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,620
other left labor councils in the 1980s.

481
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,540
Thatcher closed down because they were two good examples of what you could do

482
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,460
instead, and a lot of that was moving away from top down paternistic, but, and

483
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,500
to create bottom up cooperative type structures, but I don't think it's a

484
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,060
centralization seat decent enough, because often to make the, you need

485
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,140
economies of scale often to make them work.

486
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,220
So it's only the Preston model.

487
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,100
If they just had a few co-ops, they, okay, that works.

488
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,500
But once you start getting lots of co-ops and they all start to

489
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,660
collaborate with each other, sometimes they might be buying and selling.

490
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,420
Other times they just might be working together in other ways.

491
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:46,700
You start to actually generate more productive wealth, but also I think

492
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,900
the other key thing is it empowers people and it changes people politically

493
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,620
and culturally, and they feel more self-confident.

494
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,620
That's the other key thing.

495
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,300
Lots of the other problem, the high ECU model, of course, is it just treats

496
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,180
people as disposable commodities.

497
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,660
And, you know, we had zero, I don't, you know, zero hours contracts and stress.

498
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,060
And as I said, all the stuff we were talking about before, and if you

499
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,980
create healthier and happier people, that's what they want to do.

500
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,940
People want to contribute.

501
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,060
They would like to contribute to society, but they need to be happy as well.

502
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,420
So that seems to be a key thing.

503
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,820
So I'm a bit wary about the centralization decentralization debate,

504
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,580
particularly because of Brexit.

505
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,700
We suddenly, suddenly everyone's in favor of the federal Republic of Europe.

506
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,700
That's one thing the Brexiteers have done.

507
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,660
They've actually made the English, who had the major Europhobic problem.

508
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,260
They've actually created a mass pro-European movement in England, which is bizarre.

509
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,340
I had never thought I'd see demonstrations with large numbers of

510
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,660
people flying European flags.

511
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,940
And then if you go to the Labour Party, the two flags that people have on their

512
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,020
badges and all the rest of it are one Palestine, for obvious reasons.

513
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,380
And the second, the second is the European Union, which seemed

514
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,340
like a strange combination.

515
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,460
You can see that all around, I guess, because oftentimes it's also in the

516
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,700
public discourse, that's how it is being presented.

517
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:19,620
It's either the right-wing nationalists or the liberalism as we knew it.

518
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:29,300
And in the, let's say, mainstream media, in lack of any other term, it's described

519
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,220
as if there's nothing else, you know?

520
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,860
Well, that's what they have, and that is the classic mainstream media, like the

521
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,780
choice between a liberal or a fascist.

522
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,340
Yeah.

523
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,100
Macron had it, the Macron election.

524
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,740
You have a choice between a liberal or a fascist.

525
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,220
Yeah.

526
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,860
What's the choice?

527
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,740
That's not the choice.

528
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,060
So you'll opt for...

529
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,780
Socialism.

530
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,980
...cybernetic communism, I read somewhere.

531
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,980
Yes, exactly.

532
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,300
Do you have a catchy phrase, how you define cybernetic communism?

533
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,620
Well, that came out of the Imaginary Futures book.

534
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:03,180
I was just, I was interested, this came from this thing that the origin myth of

535
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,700
the internet is that somehow it was a system to survive a nuclear war, and this

536
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,620
goes back to the Paul Barron report in the early 1960s.

537
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:18,060
He wrote for the Rand Corporation, funded by the US Air Force, and notorious for

538
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,140
promoting the invasion of Vietnam.

539
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,660
But it struck me as that was just like very unlikely.

540
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,940
Why would you replace cheap, reliable switches with expensive, flaky mainframes?

541
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,820
I mean, we're not talking about the sort of chips we have in our mobile phones.

542
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,100
We're talking about computers the size of a room, right?

543
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,060
So this just, this didn't make sense.

544
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,180
And so it was only digging, actually, I didn't even do that much research, but

545
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,660
once you actually go and read some of the conferences from the early 1960s, the

546
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,740
1964 American Cybernetic Society, being an obvious example, they're terrified.

547
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,980
They all say the Russians are going to build the internet within four years.

548
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,620
So that's why they're doing it, because they've had Sputnik, the Americans lost

549
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,220
the race to put the first satellite, and then you have Yuri Gagarin, they lost the

550
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,340
race to put the first human into space, and Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman

551
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,180
into space. So they, you know, all these key milestones on that particular thing.

552
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,500
That's why they always go on about landing on the moon, because they have to

553
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,260
say that they lost all the early parts of the space race.

554
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,740
So that they then invented ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projectation, and its

555
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,060
next project was to stop cybernetic communism.

556
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Nikita Khrushchev, in the 22nd Party Congress, actually said the Soviet Union

557
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,540
will enter cybernetic communism in the 1970s.

558
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,500
That we will solve all the problems of central planning by building a giant

559
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,020
mainframe.

560
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:51,340
But they didn't. I mean, there was the attempt in Chile, with Stafford Beer, but

561
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,740
and there were attempts in the...

562
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,940
No, they got terrified, they got scared, because in 1968, during the Prague Spring,

563
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,900
Radovan Ritka, and the Academy of Sciences in Czechoslovakia, published this book

564
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,860
called Civilization at the Crossroads.

565
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:12,620
And it says, Stalinism is the industrial age, and we're about to enter the

566
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,300
Information Society, and this will be cybernetic communism, by the Party.

567
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,860
And so they just got really scared.

568
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,580
They suddenly thought, well, if we set up computer networks everywhere.

569
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,660
So they weren't as clever as the Chinese, you see, they just got terrified.

570
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,700
They just thought people would use it to self-organize, which of course they did.

571
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,500
But, you know, still couldn't stop solidarity in Poland, could they?

572
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,060
So that's interesting.

573
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:44,940
So everybody shut down the different way of approaching cybernetics, actually.

574
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,140
The United States shut it down in Chile, and the Soviets did it by themselves,

575
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,580
actually.

576
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,420
They didn't need somebody else to do it, no?

577
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:52,900
No, no.

578
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,820
Well, that's one of the reasons they didn't get the internet.

579
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,700
I think it's really interesting.

580
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,820
I have friends who grew up in Soviet, and every computer network was, you couldn't

581
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,740
actually operate from one network to the other.

582
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,660
They already did this with telephones.

583
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,940
They used to have layered telephone systems, which is why you should see

584
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,340
those pictures of Soviet bureaucrats.

585
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,900
They have like six telephones on their desk because it shows you've got more

586
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,500
telephones the further you went up the hierarchy because you've got access to

587
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,820
a special network, and they did the same thing because they were afraid if you

588
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,740
had one telephone system, anybody could ring anybody else.

589
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,140
And that's another thing.

590
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,860
When we come back to, when we're thinking about, you know, how modernity has

591
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,140
progressed, the command and control, top-down command and control is really

592
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,620
important, because at each stage of technology, there's a debate, a struggle,

593
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:50,540
actually, a social shaping of technology over who's going to control it.

594
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,740
Is it going to be bottom-up or is it going to be top-down?

595
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,740
And the internet is a very classic example of that.

596
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,220
And it's a super important part you're just mentioning because one of the

597
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,460
titles of a chapter within an essay that Evgeny Morozov just recently published

598
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,220
in the New Left Review, the whole essay is called Digital Socialism, but one of

599
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,940
the chapters, it's titled Socialize the Means of Feedback Production!

600
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:29,420
So that would be an obvious barrier, you know, because right now the means of

601
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:37,020
feedback production, that would actually be the ground upon which such a cybernetic

602
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:45,500
planned economy could be done, you know, they are right now owned privately by

603
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:53,980
huge corporations and a necessary step would be to socialize these means of

604
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,700
feedback production.

605
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,780
Well, all to supersede them.

606
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,220
That's, well, in a sense, but you think something like Google is effectively owned

607
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,620
by the state, I mean, it's, you know, it's a creation of the National Security Agency.

608
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,340
But it's not owned by the state.

609
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,300
But it's effectively controlled by the Americans.

610
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,020
I mean, it's when they go on and on about the Americans, but not by the state, no?

611
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,060
By the elite, then, okay.

612
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,260
But you think when they go on about Huawei, they go on about Huawei in the back doors,

613
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,500
allegedly, in its technology, and you think they're just talking about themselves.

614
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
That's what they're doing.

615
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,700
Now, what's Google?

616
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
It's a giant information machine.

617
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,580
We're sucking up data for the national security state in America.

618
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,540
I mean, you have a choice now.

619
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,620
Do you want to be spied, use Apple and be spied on by the American secret police or

620
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,060
Huawei and be spied on by the Chinese secret police?

621
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,140
I mean, that's a great choice for you, isn't it?

622
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,700
Yeah.

623
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,740
So that there would have to be a different kind of entity.

624
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,580
When you talk about socializing, they are socialized already.

625
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,300
It's just how they're socialized.

626
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,220
So what does it, you know, socially, you know, it's what Mark, again, what Mark points out

627
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,380
in volume three of capital, a joint stock company is a form of social ownership.

628
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,580
It's just a social ownership.

629
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,580
It's structured in a particular way to benefit a particular class.

630
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,260
But you see, so it's not individual ownership.

631
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,900
It is a form of social ownership.

632
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,780
So Google is a form of social ownership, which, you know, the founder, the two founders

633
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
basically own it outright.

634
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,500
I mean, the shares are traded, but they don't really, they can't appoint the board of

635
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,980
directors. So so who they who they're accountable to.

636
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,780
I mean, that's another question.

637
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,260
You know, I said it was originally funded by the NSA.

638
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,420
So you could think if you go back enough through the interconnections of the American

639
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,100
elite. But it's not possible to right now.

640
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:48,260
It's that the information that is selected, you know, it's not possible to use to

641
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:54,780
build some, you know, I don't know, a cooperative project built upon the data

642
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,540
that is being collected because they are protecting it.

643
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,540
Well, not just that is that what we've all been using Google for 20 odd years and

644
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,100
building up its knowledge base.

645
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,740
That's the key thing. If you could, you could theoretically build a better search

646
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,180
engine. But what you wouldn't have is 20 years of searches done by millions of

647
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,820
people. And that's what gives it its edge over anybody else is that embedded

648
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,980
knowledge, which everybody has.

649
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,860
We've all helped build Google or Apple or Amazon or any of these companies.

650
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,380
So it is in a way they are socialized.

651
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,540
It's just how they're socialized.

652
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,220
They're not. It's like, again, it's not the Austrian school.

653
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,140
It's all about the individual consumer.

654
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,700
But that's actually not how society we're talking about millions, billions of

655
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,700
people collectively creating something, how it's captured and molded.

656
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,460
That's a completely different question.

657
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,500
But I don't think I think socialization is the wrong word.

658
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,820
Oh, really interesting.

659
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,380
They already socialized.

660
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,620
They've been socialized.

661
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,900
They've always been socialized.

662
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,540
They were socialized when they were funded at Stanford University.

663
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,580
The corporations are social institutions.

664
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,260
They just run as dictatorships.

665
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,820
Well, I think with the word socialized, I associate the common ownership, you know,

666
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,660
that everybody would have access to the benefits of it.

667
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,300
Well, you do. You do with Google.

668
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,060
You can use it.

669
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,860
Well, yeah, I can I can use it to Google something by which I just add some more

670
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,940
of the information to their databases.

671
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180
But we want to get our hands on the databases.

672
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,300
And you benefit from that.

673
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,220
The fact that they've accumulated all this knowledge, you type something rather

674
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,540
esoteric into it, it suddenly throws up.

675
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,780
I mean, a lot of it is junk, but then by going through it and sort you help them

676
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,340
sort it by what's relevant and the next person who types in the same piece of

677
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,620
rubbish gets a more hopefully gets a more accurate feeding.

678
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,740
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

679
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,300
But still, I do not get it because I mean, if you take some industry and it

680
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,620
builds some houses and I can profit by living in this house, it's still the the

681
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,820
company that builds the houses is not socialized because the means of

682
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,420
production are not within common ownership.

683
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,740
So so that would be different.

684
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,420
It is a form of common ownership.

685
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,540
Come again, sir.

686
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,820
It is a form of common ownership.

687
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,460
It's just run as a dictatorship.

688
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,620
It's not in the in the sorts of Austrian school fantasy economics that you're

689
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,860
taught at school or even Keynesian.

690
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,860
But you are always treated as an individual.

691
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,060
It's all about individual consumers, individual producers.

692
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,340
But that's why the joint stock company becomes an immediate problem.

693
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,620
You know, there's, I don't know, the theory of the firm and all that sort of stuff.

694
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,980
I mean, one of that thing is that they prove that companies by definition can

695
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,820
be more efficient than markets.

696
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,580
That's what Adam Smith says at the beginning of volume one of The Wealth of Nations.

697
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,940
There's two ways of dividing and distributing labor.

698
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,740
One is the market.

699
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,740
The other is the firm or the state, depending on how you look at it, the plan,

700
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,100
whatever you call it, then there's two different ways.

701
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,340
And so this is not something new that you can know.

702
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,460
The pin factory is not a market.

703
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,740
They don't buy and sell each the bits of the pin to each other.

704
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,500
But you could do it like that.

705
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,620
Theoretically, I mean, to a high equity, you think that's actually how you do it.

706
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,460
They don't want to have the firm at all, really.

707
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,980
They just want to have everything, you know, internal markets for everything.

708
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,300
There are people who tried that miserably.

709
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,980
I know they tried it at our university.

710
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,180
They were going to have a sort of bidding for office space in the same way.

711
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,660
Really?

712
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,860
Oh, yeah, you know, it was just like this.

713
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,500
It was like the I think it was actually was the Blair period

714
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,340
where they got even more bizarrely entranced by all this.

715
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,460
But you can see again, you can see that in the EU where markets

716
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,860
become a sort of technocratic solution because they're not democratic by definition.

717
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,500
And, you know, you want to have a solution and it all looks very nice.

718
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,580
You know, you can just set down a set of policies and it works in the university.

719
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,940
So I think I think that's the problem.

720
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,060
So when you think or talk about socializing, something like that,

721
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,260
they already are social.

722
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,500
It's just that they're not democratic or open.

723
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,220
That's the key thing.

724
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,020
So what you should be talking about is democratizing them or opening them up

725
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,540
and sharing the knowledge.

726
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,900
That's also, I think, very new because our starting point somehow was

727
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,940
that the need for new imaginaries.

728
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:29,100
And I think this is a very nice imaginary to democratize economies, you know.

729
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,620
So, you know, I have worked with a colleague called Christian Fuchs.

730
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,220
He's a very, you know, very smart guy.

731
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,460
But he was going on about nationalizing Google, basically.

732
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,820
And that's what friends of mine pulled out.

733
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,180
One, it basically is national.

734
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,700
It's one sense it is nationalized because it's because of its connection

735
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,260
with the security apparatus.

736
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,100
And the second thing, the whole point isn't actually to get away from

737
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,980
that type of model of software, you know, having one giant big server,

738
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,340
basically, model of software.

739
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,900
I mean, they, you know, they write the software.

740
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,380
So they would say, well, that's part of the problem.

741
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,260
Yes, just turning it from nominally owned by its two founders

742
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,660
and Wall Street Investor, the venture capitalists or whatever.

743
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,500
I think actually, I think it is basically owned by the two founders nowadays

744
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,460
because all the rest of the shares don't actually have any voting right.

745
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,900
But it doesn't really matter.

746
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,860
It's actually the model of centralizing all the information in one company

747
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,580
is the problem.

748
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,260
And really what you want to do is have, you know, distributed forms of,

749
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,060
if you were to do a search engine, it should be a distributed search engine,

750
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,660
not this particular model that came out of the 1990s.

751
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,020
So I think that's an interesting debate where they're actually saying,

752
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,620
well, you know, it's not just taking the same technology

753
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,740
and just changing the ownership to, you know, Google,

754
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,260
PLC or private, you know, private corporation to state corporation.

755
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,740
Or it's something more than that.

756
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,660
Or even calling it a co-op, you know, a co-op of its workers or something.

757
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,700
It's actually to change the technology itself.

758
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,860
The part of the problem is that it's designed as top-down technology.

759
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,060
And so simply just changing the ownership, calling it socialized.

760
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,660
It's like, as I said, it's like thinking, it's like Confucian socialism, isn't it?

761
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,500
The form of Confucian socialism.

762
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,340
And what you really want to do is actually not only change its ownership,

763
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:32,540
but change the type of software and the way the software operates in the network.

764
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:37,020
And again, I'm not an expert in software or hardware,

765
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,660
but this seems to be a very interesting idea.

766
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,980
When we come back to the shaping of technology,

767
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,780
that it looks, you know, we go around doing things because it's,

768
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,020
you know, lots of social relations are embedded in the technologies that we use,

769
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,940
hardwares and software.

770
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,620
And so we just adopt type of behavior patterns

771
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:03,180
because it's essentially, that's how it's the easy way to operate your life, basically.

772
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,900
And it's teaching you to operate in a sense of social relation.

773
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,020
So simply to, you know, declare Google red.

774
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,860
It's not going to make, it's actually not going to solve the problem.

775
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,140
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

776
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,700
So he already distributes his project for free anyway.

777
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,180
It is communism.

778
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:21,660
It's free.

779
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,220
I think they charged me five euros to go to that exhibition.

780
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,580
I thought that was quite overrunning, really.

781
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,020
The moza?

782
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,740
Ah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,980
I said, socialism should be free, mate.

784
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,460
They haven't got to communism yet.

785
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,020
They're obviously just in the transitional phase, aren't they?

786
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,940
Where they still have to charge you money to go in.

787
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,500
Oh, another approach that is currently discussed,

788
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,060
or actually since like three or four years is being put out there

789
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,700
and that I wanted to check what your position is towards,

790
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,100
is this concept of fully automated luxury communism by Aaron Bastani.

791
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,140
Oh yeah, that's wonderful.

792
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,660
I read that book.

793
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,260
I actually had to debate with Aaron on his books.

794
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,780
Oh, I'll have to check that one.

795
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,660
Is there a video?

796
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,540
Yeah, sure it is.

797
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,620
It was done in Newspeak House.

798
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,700
Okay, I have to get my hands on this audio or video recording.

799
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
It was done for virtual futures.

800
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,020
That's what I'm trying to think.

801
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,860
All right, so you like the book.

802
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,820
You like the concept.

803
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,340
How do I like the book?

804
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,300
That's a really good question.

805
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,420
I was being very polite.

806
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,900
I could have been nastier to it.

807
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,660
But I think the good thing,

808
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,340
I think there's lots of problems with the book.

809
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,820
I mean, there's all the things like mining asteroids,

810
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,660
which are completely bonkers in my view.

811
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,300
But that's a different question.

812
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,860
I think what's good about it is it's very positive.

813
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,860
And what you need, as you said,

814
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,900
in a way it's not so much whether or not you agree with the utopia.

815
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,140
It's whether it's the fact that people are going out and saying,

816
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,700
well, we can build a post-capitalist society.

817
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,060
It's very technological determinism.

818
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,260
That's my problem with it.

819
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,100
Because I think, and I just have been, as I said,

820
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,300
having read capital,

821
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,020
I have a big problem with the words fully automated.

822
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,860
Because I think that that actually is a vision

823
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,580
of being dominated by technology.

824
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,100
Because that's not reshaping the machine.

825
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,100
That's expelling living labor from the production process,

826
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,300
which you don't want to do.

827
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,860
What you want to be able to do is control the production of goods and services.

828
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,780
That's like, you know, it's like basic income.

829
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,740
I always feel this is a very dubious concept.

830
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,180
Because, you know, welfare for all.

831
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,860
That's quite good when you're in a 20-year thing.

832
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,340
That's great.

833
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,020
I could just go and collect a cheque every week and have fun.

834
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,340
But I don't think that really, you know,

835
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,940
what you really want to do is have basic services.

836
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,900
You know, the good example in Britain is that health care is free.

837
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,220
And so, in fact, she would have loved to privatize.

838
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,060
If we'd had charging for health care,

839
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,140
we'd have really expensive health care now.

840
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,300
But because it was free, she couldn't do it.

841
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,540
They can try and privatize the back end.

842
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,180
But if you tried to introduce charging for health care in England,

843
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,460
there'd be a revolt, even among right-wing voters.

844
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,700
And so, that's a really interesting thing.

845
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:21,020
So, there was a discussion in the 1980s about abolishing public transport fares,

846
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,740
which I spoke in favor of when they edited this.

847
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,740
And the unions didn't want to do this

848
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,940
because there were people involved in selling and collecting tickets.

849
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,060
And but if they'd abolished fares, they couldn't reintroduce them.

850
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,180
I just think now we have very expensive public transport in London.

851
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,540
But I think if they abolished it,

852
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,260
it's very, very difficult to reintroduce it once it's done.

853
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,260
That's a very good point you're making, I guess,

854
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:51,340
because that would be an essential first step would be

855
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:58,940
to create universal basic services for housing, for transport, for education, for health,

856
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:06,540
and really build thick structures around it that are able to last for a long, long time.

857
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,580
And thereby, what's the same with universities, because university used to be free.

858
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,180
And then it is here exactly.

859
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,740
And then Blair introduced very low fees.

860
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,660
And there were people making excuses.

861
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,340
And I remember saying at the time, well, if you introduce low fees, they'll be higher.

862
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,980
Because that's the point is just to get people used to paying something.

863
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,260
And once you pay something, then you can charge them 50 grand a year.

864
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,780
And that is the point.

865
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,340
So I think one of the things is taking things out of the market,

866
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,820
the basic things in life, health care, education, housing.

867
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,300
And then you can have, you know, then people want to buy and sell other things.

868
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,940
That's fine.

869
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,380
What's the next step after that?

870
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,900
Let's imagine a future where this has happened.

871
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,460
Where our children, where our little children are going to do.

872
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,940
Do a Keynesian, the future of my grandchildren kind of thing.

873
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,140
What would that be?

874
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:01,580
What do you mean?

875
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,700
The four-day week, the three-day week, you know, that sort of thing.

876
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,900
The Labour Party has actually adopted a policy of introducing a four-day week.

877
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,300
Yeah.

878
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,860
Which again, it's one of the mistakes the French Socialist Party did is

879
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,220
they reduced the working week, but not by a whole day.

880
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:21,260
And so they actually, it's been very difficult in France to push work back up again.

881
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,940
And it doesn't seem to have affected the French economy that hugely.

882
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,820
But they always have, if you read right-wing papers,

883
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,220
they're always going on and on about the restriction on the working week.

884
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,780
But you think if they give them the whole extra day off, that would have really screwed.

885
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,940
Because, you know, they've never been able to, even the Popular Front in the 1930s,

886
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,100
the 1936 Front Popular, they introduced the Grand Vacances,

887
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:51,100
which, so basically France closes down in August, thanks to the workers' rebellion in 1936.

888
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
It's a bit annoying sometimes when you're a tourist,

889
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,540
but you do think that was an achievement.

890
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,900
And the same thing in England.

891
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:05,100
We basically, from Christmas Eve to past New Year's Eve, the whole of England closes down.

892
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,660
And this is from the 1970s strikes.

893
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,900
We had all these massive strikes.

894
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,180
And the great achievement, even now, despite all these decades of neoliberalism,

895
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:21,020
is the whole country closes down on Christmas Eve and doesn't reopen until after New Year's Day.

896
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,940
So those sorts of spaces, I think, are really interesting.

897
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,580
It's interesting, though, things like National Health Service and

898
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,500
the long winter Christmas holiday.

899
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,620
Those are essentially what they find really difficult to roll back,

900
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:37,340
that shows you what really powerful achievements that people aren't really willing to give up,

901
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,100
however much shit they're reading from the mainstream media.

902
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:47,020
So we've got this, like, next step thing,

903
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,500
which would be the Universal Baker's Basic Services kind of thing.

904
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,380
And a shorter working week.

905
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,140
I think that would make people happy.

906
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,900
And then after that, if we get that, if we get a four-day week,

907
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,700
same payment, of course, then a three-day week, and then...

908
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,580
What do you mean, ecotopia?

909
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,300
I don't know.

910
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,500
Where do we go from there?

911
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,580
You know, what are you pushing for?

912
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,620
We hunt in the morning and read poetry in the afternoon.

913
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,060
Yeah, I mean, that would be one of the...

914
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,300
Not finalists, of course, the wrong term and the wrong idea to it.

915
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,260
But that would be a...

916
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,580
Charles Fourier, who thought he should overcome the division of labour.

917
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,380
That's what he...

918
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,620
Every four hours, you'd switch jobs or...

919
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,780
Yeah, but you needn't have to do that, you know?

920
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:44,060
For me, at least, there's an inner image where I'm free to

921
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,980
do the work that I intrinsically want to do.

922
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,060
And I'm not a lazy person.

923
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,140
I just want to decide myself what I want to put my efforts in.

924
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,260
And also, people like being with other people.

925
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,100
And if they got a collective project that's to the social benefit,

926
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,700
it makes them feel happy doing it.

927
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,180
Yeah, yeah.

928
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,980
I mean, that's the difficulty is how do you turn

929
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,220
the sort of production of goods and services that we have

930
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,300
into a society which is democratic?

931
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,260
Because it's been so built on class hierarchy.

932
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,020
It's funny that here you get people who claim that this isn't a class...

933
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,300
They say, oh, England's terrible, it's divided into classes

934
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,140
as if Austria isn't divided.

935
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,980
I just look at them with that absolutely black...

936
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,260
I think you just...

937
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,220
Obviously, again, the ideology here is, you know,

938
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,980
it's all social consensus, everyone's happy.

939
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,300
There are still people, you know, in the hotel, cleaning the hotel,

940
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,380
I mean, waiting in bars.

941
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,660
So let's, I mean, maybe it's counterproductive,

942
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,860
but still I have to ask, let's put a name tag on it.

943
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,060
Communism.

944
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,020
All right.

945
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,460
Just to annoy Americans.

946
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,780
I used to call myself communist until I started going to America as an adult.

947
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,420
And then you really...

948
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,900
Because you say anything left with you, you try and explain,

949
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,380
no, I'm a social democrat or a...

950
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,260
Whatever, then you just gave up and just say, no, I'm a communist.

951
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,420
And then they get, I mean, probably not now,

952
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,340
but I always remember that people would be really shocked.

953
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,500
They never met anybody who actually would say this

954
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,700
and not be, you know, a Stalivist or something.

955
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,340
Yeah.

956
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,380
And I just recently heard that, because I'm really interested,

957
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:26,140
I heard that there are people calling themselves radical social democrats.

958
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,060
I never heard of that before, but I just recently heard...

959
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,020
Oh, this one of mine used to say,

960
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,260
we should call ourselves libertarian social democrats,

961
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,620
because that's LSD.

962
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,340
Okay, I see.

963
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,780
So I've got the class of the new, how's this at the end, libertarian social,

964
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,660
because it was his joke.

965
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,860
And I just thought it was such a great...

966
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,740
And the funny thing is the only person who got the joke were the Russians.

967
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,020
The Russians got the joke immediately and no one else did.

968
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,740
They all got the joke.

969
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,300
One last question I'm always asking.

970
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,020
If you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

971
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,100
My little boy.

972
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,740
I think he's my little...

973
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,620
He's my future.

974
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,620
Some Christian came up to me outside the shopping centre and said,

975
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,060
what happened to you?

976
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,580
Will you live on after death?

977
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,980
And I pointed to Artie and said, look, here he is.

978
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,980
I think, well, yeah, he makes you optimistic.

979
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:19,580
You see them crying up, hopefully he leaves them a better world.

980
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,900
Richard, thanks a lot.
