0	7560	Welcome to Huge Histories, my name is Jan Groos and it is my great pleasure to welcome the Writing Collective
7560	10640	Planning for Entropy in today's episode.
10640	18100	I first became aware of Planning for Entropy through their fantastic contribution to the 2022
18100	25200	special issue of the Science and Society Project Envisioning Socialism, a paper titled
25200	30500	Democratic Economic Planning, Social Metabolism and the Environment.
30500	37800	They have since expanded in terms of content and in personnel and I'm absolutely excited to feature their work in future
37800	43900	histories since it pushes some of the most crucial questions surrounding the planning debate.
43900	50400	You will hear a couple of authors mentioned in this episode that developed different models of democratic planning
50500	55900	and I am happy to say that I conducted interviews with nearly all of them.
55900	62500	So if you're interested in digging deeper into democratic economic planning, then you will not only find many,
62500	70300	many episodes of future histories that engage with this topic more generally, but you will also find episodes with
70300	77600	these people who developed the models such as David Leibman, Pat Devine or Robin Hannell.
77700	85100	At one point during the interview, I mentioned a fantastic presentation I saw at a workshop I attended in Berlin.
85100	94700	The person who gave the presentation is called Walter Zeug, a researcher at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Leipzig.
94700	105400	Walter develops and applies integrated sustainability assessment models and I am happy to announce that I will soon record an episode with him too.
105400	114400	I also mentioned the work of Tim Plattenkamp with whom I already recorded an episode of future histories, which is about to be released soon.
114400	121200	So there's plenty of material to dive into if you're interested in the topic of today's episode.
121200	129800	And I think there are plenty of good reasons to be interested in socio-metabolic planning since we most definitely need to find
129800	135600	a way to set up our metabolic interaction with nature differently.
135600	145900	Before we start, I'd like to thank Sascha, Natasha, Lucas, Samuel, Fabian and Wilfried for their donations.
145900	153400	And now please enjoy today's episode with planning for entropy on socio-metabolic planning.
153400	159900	Welcome, everybody.
159900	162100	Hello, hello.
162100	165200	So let's maybe start with a quick introduction.
165200	167600	What is planning for entropy?
167600	169300	Yeah, maybe I can go for this.
169300	170800	So my name is Simon.
170800	175200	I'm working at a university called Saint Paul University in Canada.
175200	179200	Well, the reason why we're called planning for entropy is a bit funny.
179200	183700	Well, if it's funny, but in an academic way, it's a bit funny.
183700	189600	It's because when we wrote this article you were just talking about for science and society,
189600	193900	we had to choose a group name because we were too many.
193900	199000	Science and society never had five people writing for the same article.
199000	203300	So they told us we don't have space for all those names.
203300	207700	So you have to have a collective name for all those authors.
207700	209500	And then we didn't know what to do.
209500	212400	We didn't want to have only one person signing.
212400	215200	We didn't know what name to give.
215200	217300	So we came up with that name.
217300	223300	It looks a bit like kind of a punk rock group band name.
223300	225800	But we chose planning for entropy.
225800	228800	We never used it afterward.
228800	232900	But a lot of people are calling us that way now because of that article.
232900	237200	Even though we wrote many other articles in French and in English,
237200	242300	we are from Canada and we mostly speak English and French.
242300	248500	And therefore, yeah, it kind of stick to us, even though it was just this one time deal.
248500	253300	So it would be long to introduce everyone in our research group.
253300	259300	We're about 12 people, about half of them are profs in different universities in Canada
259300	266700	and half of them are either students or independent researcher, mostly grad students.
266800	272800	So that's it. Maybe we can present each of us that are here with you, Yann, today.
272800	277200	So my name is Simon Tremblay-Peupin and I'm a professor at Saint-Paul University
277200	284800	and I'm working on planning and post-capitalist economic systems since about 15 years now.
284800	287500	So that's it. Maybe Sophie, you want to follow up?
287500	293700	Yes. So my name is Sophie Elias-Prinsano and I recently finished a degree
293800	299700	in socio-ecological economics in Vienna at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.
299700	307400	And I'm now an associate researcher at IRIS, a socio-economic research institute in Montreal.
307400	310400	And my name is Mathieu Perron-Dufour.
310400	318100	I work at the University du Qu√©bec in Ottawa and I'm an economist.
318100	324600	And I work largely on international issues, capital flows, international trade, things like that.
324600	330900	And, of course, as well on alternative economic systems and democratic planning.
330900	338200	So the title of your 2022 paper nicely sums up some of the main topics that we want to talk about today,
338200	344100	namely democratic economic planning, social metabolism, and the environment.
344100	348900	How do these fields relate to each other and why is it important to bring them together?
348900	354200	And maybe since some of my listeners might not be familiar with the concept,
354200	360100	maybe you could start by explaining social metabolism as a concept and idea.
360100	369300	Yes. So the expression social metabolism is used to refer to the biophysical dimension of economic processes.
369300	373800	And so when we talk about the metabolism of organisms,
373800	382100	it's the process by which they create and maintain their structure by exchanging materials and energy with their environment.
382100	389700	And so as an analogy, the social metabolism refers to the flows of matter and energy used to sustain material stocks.
389700	399900	And so material stocks include both human bodies and also material artifacts that are used by society.
399900	403700	And so we think, and in general, in ecological economics,
403700	409500	that understanding the economy as a social metabolism provides a particular lens
409500	416900	that can be very helpful in analyzing the biophysical reality of economic structures.
416900	422600	And then it also sees the economic process with its four points,
422600	430200	the points of extraction, production, consumption, and waste and dissipation to get outside from the dichotomy
430200	435200	that is often there in economic analysis of only having production and consumption.
435200	440300	What is also very useful with the social metabolism is that it has accounting frameworks
440300	445300	that can help us to analyze in a very systematic ways the throughput of matter and energy.
445300	456000	And then it also has databases that exist right now to help us understand how economies have right now,
456000	458900	of course, also an ecological aspect to it.
458900	468500	And then it's also this accounting aspects that make us think about the ways we could make use of this into planning and democratic planning.
468500	472300	And so how do these fields relate to each other?
472300	481100	We think that in the context where we are urgently looking for ways to account for ecological realities in the way we organize the economy,
481100	487200	we think the framework of social metabolism could be of great use in the coordination of economic processes
487200	495200	and that if we are to coordinate economic processes in a way that is both ecologically sustainable and socially just,
495200	498400	we will have to plan it democratically.
498500	507000	And so one of the also important issues highlighted by the ecological crisis is the issue of scale.
507000	516800	And that relates to how big the economy is in relation to its natural environment and how much pressure we are exerting on it.
516800	524700	And so then ecological economics, also based on the work of Herman Daly, have stressed the importance of this question
524800	534700	and the fact that it has to be addressed on its own since it cannot be addressed indirectly by tackling issues of allocation and distribution, for example.
534700	540800	So to reach sustainability, we have to collectively give ourselves ways to act upon the scale.
540800	543900	And so that first means being able to assess it.
543900	553100	And so the approach of social metabolism provides, according to us, the language to discuss and to represent the biophysical scale of the economy.
553100	562500	Fantastic. And so basically, as I understand it, we need to find different ways through which we can address this question of social metabolism,
562500	567600	because the way we address it right now is basically catastrophic, so to speak.
567600	576200	And I mean, of course, the people who are working in the field of democratic economic planning have already heard of this catastrophe
576200	581600	and tried to incorporate the question of ecological planning into their models.
581700	592000	And you look at models by Devine and Adamann, by Kotrick and Cottrell, David Leibman, and as well as Paracon developed by Hanel and Albert.
592000	601200	And so you notice that they try to include this question of ecology into their models, but that they do not do it sufficiently, that they lack.
601200	610000	You already mentioned the question of scale and that they have a framework through which this inclusion of the question of ecology
610000	613500	can actually not succeed at the end.
613500	617000	So maybe you could tell us why you think that this is the case.
617000	624500	Let's take the three canonical models, or I don't know how to call them, but the three models from the from the 90s.
624500	629500	So Devine, Adamann, Kotrick and Cottrell, and Albert and Hanel.
629500	636400	Devine and Adamann, they are talking a lot about the question of environment in their recent work.
636400	638900	They are really preoccupied by this question.
638900	640400	Obviously, they are.
640400	647000	And their answer is, in fact, quite simple and probably a very interesting answer.
647000	650200	It's just they don't give much detail about it.
650200	656200	They are telling us the way we envision the functioning of the economy.
656200	666300	And mostly, as probably your listeners know already, Devine and Adamann are focusing mostly on investment in their model.
666300	671600	And he said, with what we propose, we will have a conscious humanity,
671600	681200	we'll have a conscious understanding of what we are doing collectively in terms of investment and its impact on the environment.
681200	684100	And therefore, we can take the best decisions.
684100	687900	We agree with this, like it's possible that that we reach that.
687900	696900	But the question of how we will be conscious of the impact of our decision on the environment is not always clear,
696900	701500	and at least for us in Devine and Adamann's model.
701500	707100	And it's a lot about we should talk about it in negotiation.
707100	709900	Their model is called negotiated coordination.
709900	711700	There's a reason for that.
711700	717300	We should negotiate about it in meetings and therefore take the best decision.
717300	726000	We think that indicators and models of how the social metabolism, for example,
726000	730300	functions would be helpful to know about this.
730300	733500	So that's the first problem we have.
733500	737900	About Kokchet and Cottrell, the answer is even simpler.
737900	743700	In their main book from 1993, Toward a New Socialism,
743700	747700	they mostly say, well, environment is a political question.
747700	752700	We don't fix this through market indicators or prices.
752700	761200	We fix this through political discussion, which comes quite a lot close to what Devine and Adamann are saying.
761200	769900	But it's even, I'd say, bigger in terms of what they imply is that we should fix that by referenda.
769900	778300	Or what we think is that a lot of questions, in fact, involve the ecological question.
778300	786200	And so if for each issue we have to make a referenda, we'll have a lot of referenda.
786200	792600	So we think that there should be an easier way to take those decisions.
792600	798700	I'm not talking about Michael Albert for participatory economics
798700	806100	because Robin Hannell has developed his specific answers much deeply in recent work,
806100	811400	like from 2017 to a book published last year.
811400	814400	And his answer is twofold, I'd say.
814400	825600	First, on one side, he has a way to locate ecological damage that has been done to a community and for this community to be compensated.
825700	836800	I won't go into details to that, but mostly the goal is for people who receive harm from pollution to get some compensation,
836800	843000	which is all right in itself, like it's not a bad thing to do, but it's quite limited.
843000	851700	And it does not at all the question of the environmental equilibrium that we need to reach and to live in harmony with.
851700	860800	On the other side, which is more interesting on that level, he proposes development plans at the level of the environment.
860800	868800	But here again, as for the two precedent models, he does not offer how we would do this and from which point of view
868800	877000	and how his shadow prices, for example, are helping us to understand what is the state of the environment right now.
877000	883900	In fact, in his recent book, he takes one or two sentences to tell us there will be a ministry of environment.
883900	888600	He'll take care of providing the data and we'll go from there.
888600	892800	That's all right. But let's say if I'm being generous,
892800	901700	I would say that we would like to know how this ministry will function and on which data it will base its decision and reflections.
901700	910900	So that's where we come in, saying that we need to have a broader vision, mostly based on what Sophie just told you.
910900	920100	Fantastic. So let's take a closer look at this broader vision of what we could base our decisions on, basically.
920100	930600	So it seems as if what you are proposing is that we should go for developing a better idea of the throughput of matter and energy
930600	935600	and how this relates to the social worlds that we engage with.
935600	943200	And of course, it would be absolutely helpful to get a clearer picture of how these two things relate to each other.
943200	951200	So maybe you could go into how you approach your own framework, how you think that these measurements,
951200	962400	these data points also of material throughput and energy can help us with developing alternative ideas of democratic planning.
962400	966800	Well, I'll try to be simple because the idea is quite simple.
966800	971800	How we will do it will be complicated, but what we want to do is quite simple.
971800	974700	First, we have to build a representation.
974800	986900	That's what Sophie was talking about, a representation of how this social metabolism works and is in relationship with the rest of the environment around it.
986900	988900	So that's the first thing we have to do.
988900	996200	And that's a theoretical, that's like an abstract representation that will help us understand what's happening.
996200	998000	This does not exist right now.
998000	1007900	Like there's no way for the moment in the capitalist system we live in to know exactly what are those interactions.
1007900	1015800	Friends around the world are trying to do this and are trying to build such a representation, but it does not exist at the moment.
1015900	1028100	Then we think we should think about the long-term planning of society in terms of what we have called in a recent paper, socio-metabolic planning.
1028100	1039500	So the notion we are developing here is that long-term development and long-term vision of our society should be integrated.
1039600	1063400	So when, for example, Devine and Adamann are talking about investment planning, which all the others also do, we should, when we do this, take into consideration what will be the relationship of what we will do and what do we want for nature around us and how we want to develop inside the environment.
1063900	1079000	So this is kind of a vision of social ecology, if we can say like it's an understanding of us as inside a first nature that has to develop, that has to be maintained in equilibrium.
1079000	1091800	And also, we want to see where we want to go as a society inside that and when we want our planet to go in terms of the development of its environment.
1091900	1098000	So this is the kind of planning we want to import into democratic planning.
1098600	1110400	Our message to the democratic planning gang is to say we have to include all of this in our planning, not just what humans do.
1111100	1115500	We have to include what's happening to the environment and our relationship to all that.
1115800	1123200	And to the economic, the ecological economics gang, we're saying, well, we have to do all this democratically.
1123600	1134000	It's through democratic planning that we can attain that, not through some kind of technocratic decisions, decision-making that would not be the best way to reach our objective.
1134300	1139000	So this is kind of the two messages we're trying to send on both ways.
1139000	1151700	And on that, for example, one of our members, Bengi Agbulut, wrote a very interesting text in Ecological Economics a few years ago, telling them, well, maybe we have to take to understand what's that.
1151700	1160900	And she wrote it with Fikret Adaman, who was a non-divine partner in this project that they have about democratic planning.
1161400	1172800	So they wrote this article saying to the Ecological Economics group, well, you have to look at what's happening on democratic planning side, because those two worlds have to come together.
1172900	1174100	And that's what we're trying to do.
1174700	1185100	So in order to kind of merge these worlds of ecological economics and democratic planning, we will need to have some elements that come together.
1185600	1190200	And you describe a couple of them within your paper.
1190700	1206400	You quite clearly state that we will need to construct deliberative planning institutions, that we will need to institutionalize non-reductionist categories that express social metabolism in biophysical and ecological terms instead of output terms.
1206800	1220200	And you say that we need to create a framework to manage the biophysical scale of the throughput and the nature of ecological relations inherent in the social metabolism of a post-capitalist society to come.
1220500	1224800	So there are a couple of things we need to build, so to speak.
1225100	1247000	Maybe let's start with looking at the alternative indicators, because Simon, you already mentioned many of the models right now do propose things in very broad terms, but still sometimes they lack a concrete idea of how we could get to implementing those ideas.
1247000	1255700	And crucially also, they lack indicators that might serve as a basis for the collective decision making.
1255700	1262600	So we will need to develop indicators that are not based on market prices as it is done right now.
1262600	1268900	And we can see how absolutely catastrophic the outcome of this mechanism is.
1269300	1274100	So you detail that market prices are absolutely not the right way to go.
1274400	1276700	But what are the indicators that we need?
1276700	1288100	What are the alternative indicators that you propose that can represent these biophysical relations to the social metabolism better than markets can?
1288400	1292100	So what do we have to develop in order to get there?
1292600	1292900	Right.
1292900	1299700	Well, of course, that's a complicated question, and that will vary depending on what we're talking about.
1300300	1310100	Raising tomatoes won't be the same as organizing a whole ecosystem in some cases, or mining some other resources, right?
1310100	1313300	So different sectors will require different sets of indicators.
1313300	1322400	But the broad idea here is that, as you say, market prices are not adequate to address this for a variety of reasons.
1322800	1330600	And currently, of course, what we have is we have plenty of planning and capitalism, but it's largely around financial imperatives.
1331000	1337800	And therefore, like from units, which every time they can pawn costs on other people.
1338100	1340500	So then those prices don't account for that.
1340800	1349200	But beyond that, even if we were to say, okay, like we're in a different system anyway, can't we just sit together,
1349200	1356500	figure out priorities and then put a set of prices and have people interact around that, there's even an issue with that.
1356500	1369500	And that's like prices or financial quantities, we think, cannot represent like the whole diversity, the whole variety of things we need to care about.
1369900	1381600	So there's this concept in ecological economics, the incommensurability, sorry for the pronunciation, of those different dimensions that cannot be put on a single scale.
1381600	1384100	So there's no way to get prices right in a sense.
1384100	1386800	We know market prices don't do a good job.
1387300	1396300	But there's also no single set of right prices that could do a right job, which is why Simone was talking about shadow prices before.
1396700	1399200	We'll need prices for some stuff, probably.
1399600	1405600	There are going to be some zones where people interact around those prices and that'll be fine.
1405900	1415600	But we'll also need all sorts of indicators to understand what kind of impact our actions, our interaction with the environment are having.
1415600	1420000	Coming back to my tomatoes, for example, we'll need an indicator of water usage.
1420500	1422300	That's not a price, that's a quantity.
1422400	1428800	There's no way to get a price of that and then hope that interactions will get us to the right quantity.
1429700	1439600	It's a quantity and we'll need to figure out what kind of total water usage we want for our culture, what kind of what amount we want for tomatoes, et cetera, et cetera.
1440000	1442900	And I think we might get to this question later on.
1442900	1448700	But of course, this also influences how we see products that might come from outside the community as well.
1449300	1458600	So there's going to be a whole different accounting in terms of just not just equating the lowest cost or whatever when we think about trade or things like that.
1458900	1465500	So that's the broad idea to have this multiplicity of indicators, biophysical indicators, some prices.
1465500	1476700	And I would add maybe a third category of social and political indicators related to what we want, what we wish, for example, in terms of basic needs.
1476900	1478900	Are we reaching those basic needs?
1478900	1480200	How are we doing it?
1480200	1482600	How are we attaining this, et cetera?
1482600	1488400	So again, the specifics will have to vary in terms of sectors, in terms of industry.
1488400	1489900	But that would be the broad idea.
1490300	1499000	Maybe let's dig a little bit deeper there, because I mean, for me, it's easy to imagine a scenario in which we are provided with these additional indicators.
1499400	1512500	This is happening already in capitalist contexts where life cycle analysis or something like that might provide ideas about what kind of resources went into a certain product.
1512500	1514700	So this is kind of happening right now.
1515200	1520200	However, you write that the tools that you propose could be used to, and I quote you here,
1530000	1530800	End quote.
1531200	1551500	So this, of course, sounds very, very exciting, but still I need some more elements in order to get a clear idea of how we can come to a coherent set of mechanisms, so to speak, that will together form a political economy based on this ecological paradigm.
1551800	1577800	So maybe you could help me paint this picture in my head in order to get a better idea of how these different elements that you propose can become factors when it comes to the active coordination of an economy instead of being an additional factor of information that is also supplied in capitalist contexts today.
1578400	1592500	Yes, so that's a very good question, and I think let's maybe start by going back to what Simon talked about, the long-term economic planning, the long-term metabolic planning as well.
1592900	1605800	I think the thing is social metabolic planning will be done to organize need satisfaction and also in the context of defined planetary boundaries.
1606200	1620700	But then the thing is, we will have to establish a long-term social objective regarding society-nature relation that is in relation to defined planetary boundaries, but are not the planetary boundaries themselves.
1621000	1634200	So it's important to distinguish between the social objective and the planetary boundary that is not seen as an objective limit to social action, but rather as an important guide to democratic debates.
1634800	1658800	And so then we establish a social objective that comes together with certain indicators that can be quantified in terms of certain accounting frameworks from the social metabolism, for example, that can help us to track and see how are we doing in front of these long-term goals.
1659700	1677200	So we have some of these long-term objectives that are socially set, but then we have to relate that as well to this day-to-day and year-to-year organization of economic processes.
1677500	1689500	So then, secondly, we can see the use of social metabolic indicators in relation to regulation, so exposed, like you first said.
1689700	1706200	So to monitor, expose the progress relating to the social objectives and to see with indicators from the social metabolism, but also with a whole set of other biophysical indicators, how we are doing in relation to our goals in the long-term,
1706200	1717300	but also related to how it is going right now and to understand how it's going in comparison to what we thought it would be going right now in relation to ecological limits.
1717600	1721100	And at this point, there would be a ton of data.
1721500	1740700	And so that's also a very important thing that we will have to think about people in certain workspaces that will be dedicated to problematize metabolic issues in production processes, but also to formulate the synthesis of this data into useful indicators.
1741400	1751800	And then that brings us to the third step or the third way of envisioning the role of social metabolism in more of an active coordination, what you were asking about.
1752400	1769500	And so we want to plan the next year's production and consumption by taking into account, first, where the last year stands according to the long-term social targets, and also second, the ecological implications of particular products and methods of production.
1770300	1794300	And so this means that we are looking at where we stand, how we thought it would go and how it did go in the end to see where we are now and to plan for the future for the next year and readjust the social target according to the scientific knowledge that exists on ecological limits and planetary boundaries.
1794800	1807100	Then we can use metabolic data related to specific products, like you said, regarding by doing life cycle analysis, and then to assess their material use throughout their whole life cycle.
1807900	1821800	And using this data to see, for example, specific products, how their production and their consumption would affect the social metabolism during the next year to come.
1822100	1833300	And then to see how products and particular infrastructures, for example, can lock us into a specific path of resource use for the next year, but also for the years to come.
1833600	1848400	And to see how, for example, how constructing specific types of buildings and specific types of transport infrastructures will have impacts on the ecological impacts of the economy for many years.
1848700	1860100	And then we're talking a lot about these indicators related to social metabolism, but it would be also necessary to use a variety of indicators and sources of knowledge as well to do so.
1860100	1875500	And so we have to discuss also metabolic flows in relation to their place within provisioning systems and to see how these ecological flows are related to other social processes.
1875800	1888300	And to see as well, for example, how they're organized to fulfill some specific needs and also how they are related to different kinds of meanings for different people and for different groups in the economy.
1888300	1896800	And all of this have to be discussed at different levels in order to integrate these different kinds of information.
1897700	1910300	And so the idea is that we can give all the relevant information, for example, by having synthesis that are done by some groups and workspaces that are dedicated to that.
1910300	1921700	And to give this information to people in structured deliberations and decision making to have a mix of decisions that are made democratically,
1921900	1928200	but also some data based decision making that is done more on a day to day basis.
1929400	1940900	So I gave three different examples that the idea is that we have several levels of planning and monitoring to set objectives and to follow our progress in relation to these objectives.
1941400	1954800	And maybe just to say it in another way, in fact, the larger metabolic planning acts like a constraint on the annual and day to day planning.
1954800	1964900	It tells us, OK, we have this larger goal we want to reach, like we don't want to reach that threshold of biodiversity, for example, on the planet.
1964900	1971600	Hence, we have to reduce the emission of this pollutant that kills that animal and that part of the world.
1972800	1983600	So if we don't want to use that pollutant, this gives us an indicator saying, OK, we have this maximum of emission that we can emit from that pollutant.
1983700	1989300	How do we give the permission, the amount of emission we can give?
1989300	1991500	How do we distribute it?
1991500	2000300	And how do we prioritize to which kind of production process we will allow to emit that pollutant?
2000300	2006100	And that comes into annual and day to day work, annual planning and day to day work.
2006200	2017100	That's what I meant by it's kind of a constraint that we're putting on our planning when doing the metabolic planning, the long term metabolic planning.
2017100	2030400	Very, very interesting, I have to say, because I was recently also on a workshop in Berlin where somebody did a really, really great presentation on how life cycle analysis could be fed into democratic planning.
2030400	2045900	And one thing that he stressed is that since the tool is not that complex, it would allow for a form of bottom up planning as well, in which you would have these constraints that you talked about, Simon.
2045900	2057600	And then people within the different socialist enterprises, for example, would be able to feed in the data from the ground to the informational system through life cycle analysis.
2057900	2062100	And therefore, we would have a combination of central and decentral elements.
2062100	2069600	And so I think this is a really, really, really interesting way to approach the whole thing that you that you sketch.
2069600	2072300	Nonetheless, there are, of course, open questions.
2072300	2081700	So one would be, do you have a bit of an idea of the specific mechanisms and also institutions that one would need in order to make this happen?
2081700	2090100	Because, Simon, you already mentioned we would have to come to a workable set of constraints.
2090100	2096200	We would have, of course, a different informational base in order to deliberate about these questions.
2096200	2106800	But still, I mean, at the end, we would have to have global constraints on our social metabolism and we would have to agree upon these global constraints.
2106800	2112500	And this is, of course, kind of a difficult thing to get to.
2112500	2121000	So do you have an idea of different mechanisms or institutions that might help with such a small task?
2121000	2127200	I wouldn't answer straight away, because I think it is quite an important question.
2127200	2138300	It is definitely one of the key challenges to coordinate the scope of decision making in regard to the scale of ecological impacts,
2138300	2150000	because, of course, every economic, social economic decision has an ecological impact or an ecological dimension to it.
2150000	2154900	And then, of course, local decisions also have global impacts.
2154900	2166300	And, of course, then, I guess global decisions, if we take all of it together, of course, has impacts in a very differentiated way in different places.
2166300	2173000	And so I would say we do not have specific institutions right now to propose.
2173000	2196400	And I guess it is open for creativity and discussion outside from the fact that we will have to coordinate these different levels of decision making in having global goals and also specific local targets and monitoring at these different scales.
2196400	2200200	I don't know if someone else wanted to add something regarding that.
2200200	2209100	Yeah, I think what you just mentioned there, that we don't have specific institution, that's coming back to the presentation of our group in the beginning.
2209100	2223500	That's also one way we like to proceed, that is not to have a specific template to say, OK, like here's if we follow from A to Z, we'll have a nice cake with democratic planning written on it at the end,
2223500	2238100	but rather a set of preoccupations and sort of basic processes that are central to us and from which communities or groups of people can then design on their own institutions that can work.
2238100	2239900	So that's one key thing.
2239900	2245200	So we don't have a specific set up in mind.
2245200	2264500	That said, I will add we can see this as sort of a hierarchy of responsibilities, both on decisions to be made in terms of production, consumption and all that with respect to the environment, but also into following some of these indicators.
2264600	2273900	For example, local communities will certainly be better placed than anybody else to understand how a local ecosystem is doing.
2273900	2284300	So even beyond broad biophysical indicators, just the health of an ecosystem, maybe you can see by knowing a forest, by taking a walk in it.
2284300	2295100	And that's something that maybe technocrats somewhere would not be able to do, even if they had, I don't know, satellites to look at the said forest.
2295100	2306900	So there's this whole source of information that will be central in the understanding of how exactly this interconnectedness is working out in practice.
2306900	2316300	That's one thing. The responsibilities of following up on how targets are working and if we should rearrange them and do things differently.
2316300	2321200	And also responsibilities on what kind of decisions we make.
2321200	2330200	And there, I don't think there's any shortcuts that can be made from making those decisions about what's global and what's local.
2330200	2337700	We'll have to discuss it, we'll have as a group to determine which is which and who gets to decide.
2337700	2344100	But we can imagine a system whereby every level has inputs into what other levels do, right?
2344100	2355600	Maybe some kind of federative structure, for example, where local boards or something or local decision bodies can send people to higher ones or different ones.
2355600	2358100	And therefore, the information circulates.
2358100	2366600	Maybe one last thing I'll say is that for this to all work, that information has to be both open and available.
2366600	2373100	And that's crucial, right? That we don't have five experts somewhere who know everything about the environment.
2373100	2375200	We give them a call every time we need to make a decision.
2375200	2377900	But really, they're the only ones knowing what's going on, right?
2377900	2385300	So it's crucial that we don't have that and that instead this information is open and it's palatable as well, right?
2385300	2400300	It will have to be made in a way whereby even non-experts or people who don't have specific knowledge about a given issue can still make an informed decision about this if those democratic planning processes are to work.
2400300	2408300	And maybe just to add two little things, because your question is so broad and so stimulating that we have a lot of answers.
2408300	2417600	I think that in the previous models, like in the three canonical models, mostly when they were written in the 90s, it changed afterwards.
2417600	2421500	But there were two answers to your question.
2421700	2428700	Divine Adaman had an answer, which was, we will take decisions on the broader issues collectively.
2428700	2443700	And then we will have this being sent down to different production units from a plan that we take a decision upon as a nation or as a country or as a region, whatever.
2443900	2454900	But we have this level and then there are local and regional places that are receiving, OK, we've decided that at this level and then it goes down.
2454900	2463900	At the opposite, Participatory Economics was saying, well, you cannot take decisions on things that do not matter to you concretely.
2463900	2467900	So take decisions on what you want to produce, what you want to consume.
2467900	2470900	And from that, a plan will be built.
2471100	2480100	That's the contribution, I'd say, from Robin and Michael, the very interesting and stimulating idea and Participatory Economics.
2480100	2490100	Both came to a place where there's more space for contribution from the other side, I'd say.
2490300	2498300	Like Robin started building investment plans, development plans and all that that are of a higher level.
2498300	2512300	While in the recent work by Fikret and Pat, you see a lot of things about local autonomy, democratic autonomy from the production units and all that.
2512500	2521500	So we all agree in the end that there is a balance to be found in this, and that's not a big surprise, let's say.
2521500	2530500	We all know that. I wrote an article on criteria about democratic planning, and one of them was COPE.
2530500	2540500	And I think it's evident that we have to have our say as a participant to this economy about what's happening in our day to day work,
2540700	2543700	but also on our larger objective.
2543700	2554700	The day to day one is easier to think about, like we can know how we can manage, self-manage a company or, you know, a workshop or whatever.
2555700	2564700	When it comes to a greater plan, a larger plan, how can we take decisions on that level clearly?
2564900	2568900	As Mathieu was saying, we are not developing a model.
2568900	2579900	If we are working on something, it's to go from those models to modules that will be, you know, that could be independent
2579900	2587900	and that could be thought of independently from the rest of a model, and maybe that could be implemented in society
2587900	2592900	when the time is not ready for other sections of the economy to be democratized.
2593100	2602100	And one of the questions we're asking is what is the kind of information that we need for citizens to participate consciously
2602100	2611100	and with all of the information available to them, but with not an overload of information, because that's the danger.
2611100	2616100	As Sophie was saying, we can have tons of data, you know, factors and all that.
2616300	2626300	But how do we take a sensible and intelligent decision on such questions and have enough data to take the decision?
2626300	2628300	This is what we're working on right now.
2628300	2636300	Like it's part of the reflection we are having about modules of planning and developing them.
2636300	2642300	So your question was right on what we're working on right now.
2642500	2650500	Excellent. I think we can even dig a little deeper because I think this is a very crucial point.
2650500	2656500	So maybe we could get to a point where people can imagine what this might look like,
2656500	2662500	because we have now established that there will be alternative indicators
2662700	2670700	that are trying to maybe also visualize the biophysical throughput,
2670700	2677700	matter and energy questions related to all kinds of materials, to labor, human labor,
2677700	2682700	also animal labor, I guess, and all these different elements.
2682700	2686700	So we will have a plethora of information and data.
2686900	2691900	And of course, as you already mentioned, this is immediately overwhelming.
2691900	2696900	So there will need to be some kind of translation as well,
2696900	2703500	I guess, in order to let people take part in a meaningful way in this deliberation.
2703500	2708500	So do you have an idea of what this might look like in concrete terms?
2709300	2716300	So if we have this large set of information on the complete throughput,
2716300	2719300	biophysical throughput on the one side,
2719300	2726300	and then we have the need to come to an informational point
2726300	2732300	that is usable for a broader public in order to take part in this deliberative process,
2732300	2735300	how do we get these two together?
2736100	2741100	What's the process that needs to take place between these two elements?
2741100	2745100	Because there needs to be some kind of translation, different mechanisms,
2745100	2749100	and it doesn't have to be one mechanism, I guess, but many, probably,
2749100	2755100	and also different sites that allow you to engage with these different types of data
2755100	2762100	and, of course, also maybe different intensities of information,
2762100	2769100	some might be willing and able to kind of take in a more abstract level of information,
2769100	2775100	others will need to have information that is kind of more easily accessible and stuff like that.
2775100	2782100	So how can we think about this relationship between broad deliberation about these topics on the one side
2782100	2786100	and the information overload on the other maybe?
2786100	2799100	One thing here is that this vision of a social metabolism allows us to segment, in a sense, this decision process.
2799100	2807100	That is, once we have an overall vision of what feeds into what and exactly what affects what,
2807100	2812100	then we can say, okay, well, some of these decisions will really have an effect on A and B,
2812100	2816100	but not really C, that's not the way it communicates.
2816100	2820100	So we don't have to constantly decide on everything at once.
2820100	2826100	What we want is an overall vision where we understand what feeds into what that's crucial,
2826100	2832100	that is, that decisions are not made without considering the impacts on all sorts of zones
2832100	2835100	and then it comes to bite us years later, right?
2835100	2841100	So it's important to have the broad vision, but we don't have to make the broad decisions every single time.
2841100	2848100	We can devolve some of the local decision making about forests, for example,
2848100	2855100	to a local group of citizens who would be more concerned about this particular issue.
2855100	2861100	And people maybe 50 kilometres down the road don't really have to have a say in that.
2861100	2868100	And it actually may be better if they don't have a say because they're not directly concerned about that.
2868100	2875100	So this social metabolic vision allows us to say, okay, these two decisions we'll need to make as a group
2875100	2881100	and then we'll need to have data and also some information to do that.
2881100	2888100	But all these other more local decisions or more regional decisions can be made at a different scale
2888100	2894100	by smaller groups of people who are directly concerned within, of course, boundaries and limits
2894100	2897100	that are set in the overall picture.
2897100	2904100	So therefore we can imagine the segmentation of decision making so that we're not constantly making decisions that feed in,
2904100	2913100	but separating it, we can make some a lot of local decisions with confidence that it fits in an overall picture
2913100	2922100	and that we don't have constantly to go and feed back with this different pictures every single time we decide to take a walk or not in the forest.
2922100	2933100	I'll follow on what Mathieu was talking about and answer your question in a more imaginative way, Jan, that you were suggesting.
2933100	2939100	Like, how could this, what could it look like? And it's just an idea.
2939100	2946100	It's not the result of research what I'm talking about, but it can give you an idea of what it could look like.
2946100	2953100	Let's take two indicators that are known right now that we have access to and that we that we're familiar with.
2953100	2955100	Well, at least a bit familiar with.
2955100	2964100	The first one would be the nine boundaries that we should, the nine threshold that humanity should not cross for the planet not to blow up.
2964100	2969100	OK, this is one known indicator that we already know about.
2969100	2976100	And if we take, for example, what the OECD has done with, how they call it, Better Life Index.
2976100	2989100	So that gives you an idea of how different populations in the world are living in terms of poverty rates, transport, health, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
2989100	2992100	So we already have those indicators. They already exist.
2992100	2998100	Let's imagine we do them better. We do them with the help of social metabolism.
2998100	3001100	We have a clearer representation of all that.
3001100	3015100	But we can summarize those representations into indicators of various type of indicators that give us an idea of where we are at the moment.
3015100	3022100	So every five years, for example, it's just an example that the calendar and all that is just to give us an idea.
3022100	3038100	Every five years, we have a broad consultation of the whole community saying this is where we are in terms of development from what we get from science and what we get from our collective work.
3038100	3041100	This is the status of our relationship with nature.
3041100	3054100	This is what we produce. This is the quantity of needs that are fulfilled with a few indicators, but that we think are central in terms of political decision making.
3054100	3059100	We will need good designers. That will be very important.
3059100	3064100	We will need people who can think about how to present data, how to do that.
3064100	3069100	But those resources exist. We have that already in our society.
3069100	3076100	And then we can have a broad discussion every five years, let's say, where we say, OK, where do we want to go?
3076100	3079100	Where do we want those indicators to be at?
3079100	3084100	Let's say we are approaching a threshold in terms of an environment question.
3084100	3090100	And let's say in biodiversity, we say, OK, this threshold is we're almost there.
3090100	3093100	What can we do not to reach it?
3093100	3103100	Well, this would mean and then we'd have an explanation of what we should reduce in terms of consumption or in terms of production, et cetera, et cetera.
3103100	3107100	And then we take a decision on where we want to go.
3107100	3120100	This then translates for all sections of the community into constraints that will be put on, for example, our work unit.
3120100	3126100	I am in a work collective. We are, let's say, building fridges.
3126100	3136100	We are producing fridges when they told us, well, this material that you're using in your fridge, we don't think it's a priority to put it in fridge.
3136100	3139100	We must use it elsewhere. We don't have much.
3139100	3147100	We don't want to use much. Hence, you have to change your process or build or build less fridge.
3147100	3154100	OK, then we say, what are the innovations we can make to replace that product that we don't have anymore?
3154100	3159100	Or should we just propose to build less fridge because we don't have a replacement for that?
3159100	3168100	And we enter that into the process, saying this is the consequences that will have this decision that we took collectively as on us.
3168100	3171100	Then maybe prices for fridges will go up.
3171100	3185100	Maybe we will have different type of fridges or maybe we won't have some, I don't know, specific and funny add-on that we add on our fridges that will not work anymore because we don't have the material to do it.
3185100	3190100	But we will change production accordingly in our workshop.
3190100	3202100	And then we will say that to others and the planning, the annual planning will take care of it in knowing that everyone is adapting, saying, oh, fridges are going up.
3202100	3213100	The price of fridges are going up. Maybe I'll keep my old fridge and won't buy a new one this year because it's too expensive and I'll wait for when it breaks up before changing it.
3214100	3223100	We hope everybody will do that in socialist society, but maybe they need indicators to tell them not to buy a new fridge every three years.
3223100	3230100	So that's the kind of link between the two that we have to develop.
3230100	3237100	And it's certain that there will be questions about how we discuss.
3237100	3245100	This must be like what in a seminar that I organized about post-capitalist economies.
3245100	3266100	One colleague said we will need a group of persons that are specialized in how do we take democratic decisions and that are training not only others to, let's say, facilitate discussions or organize data in a table that everyone can understand or, you know, those kind of things.
3266100	3272100	But also to train people to interact in a democratic fashion and in democratic decision making.
3272100	3275100	And this will be important as well.
3275100	3284100	So there's a lot of culture changes that must happen for us to reach that goal of collective decision making.
3284100	3291100	But we don't have to make decisions about those larger questions every two months.
3291100	3296100	We can set goals and say, OK, when do we reach that goal?
3296100	3303100	And maybe every year, maybe every six months, we'll find the good rhythm that's easy to find.
3303100	3320100	But the idea is to have something that we take the big decision we have and we give people the right to have a slim version of the information they need or to expand like you do on a website.
3320100	3327100	And have more information if they want to go down the rabbit hole and understand exactly.
3327100	3330100	Yeah, but why does this thing cost more?
3330100	3333100	OK, it's because we changed that and that and that.
3333100	3336100	And they can go there and see if they want to.
3336100	3339100	But they're not forced to do this.
3339100	3342100	So we reduce information overload to do that.
3342100	3347100	But we would need a very good designer for that to happen.
3347100	3363100	OK, I think we will sidestep the question how you would make the decentralized actors accept the constraints that will come from a central element, because this is, of course, an important type of negotiation, let's say.
3363100	3379100	So I think we sidestep this for a moment, at least in order to take one step more deeper into this question of economy-wide energy and material flow accounting, because this is kind of what you, I think, tried to sketch.
3379100	3393100	I mean, at least as far as I understand it, what you're proposing is that we will really try to track the resource use of all of the materials that are involved in our social metabolism.
3393100	3401100	So if, and this is maybe just to illustrate for the audience what the extent of what you're talking about, Simon, all of you talking about.
3401100	3420100	If we have a microphone, I have a microphone in front of me, then if I order the microphone, I will be able to click on the information button, let's say, of this microphone and it will show me which kinds of materials went into the production of this microphone.
3420100	3429100	Maybe also which kind of communities were affected by the use of these resources, because this will be an important aspect as well.
3429100	3438100	And all types of informations that are related to the biophysical element of this use value, so to speak.
3438100	3467100	And so this will be the informational basis on which, let's say, central planning institution of some sort, question mark, will be able to provide information about long-term plans, broader plans and kind of therefore create a sort of framework in which the decentralized units will be able to operate, if I get that correctly.
3467100	3477100	So my question then would be, how is accounting being done within this framework?
3477100	3493100	So if you talk about economy-wide energy and material flow accounting, we will have this centralized institution, centralized in the sense only that the information will need to come to a centralized point in order to be processed.
3493100	3501100	There it doesn't necessarily mean that it is centralized in terms of political centralization or hierarchization.
3501100	3511100	It shouldn't be actually, but there will be a place, an institution where you will have all this information, which I talked about when I talked about the microphone, will come together.
3511100	3520100	But then how is it being processed in order to get to a plan based upon this plethora of information?
3520100	3527100	What are the ways through which this weighing also takes place?
3527100	3537100	Because you will have to have some kind of weighing in order to decide why we should use this production method in comparison to another one.
3537100	3545100	And right now, of course, as we know, we do have market forces that force us into this decision.
3545100	3551100	And this is what the Austrian economists praise as if this was the Holy Grail.
3551100	3565100	So we would need to find an alternative element, an alternative logic and an alternative mechanism in order to provide for this necessary task, so to speak.
3565100	3570100	How would this happen based upon this alternative paradigm?
3570100	3573100	Yeah, on the issue of information, right?
3573100	3585100	Of course, every time we try to fathom the entirety of the information that we would need to have on your microphone, for example, like everything you named, it seems like a lot.
3585100	3587100	But I would argue this information already exists.
3587100	3592100	It's just that the firm making the microphone has it somewhere.
3592100	3596100	Probably not everybody in the firm is aware of all of this.
3596100	3599100	Of course, it's separated in the department that's segmented.
3599100	3600100	But the information exists, right?
3600100	3612100	We're simply talking about figuring out a way to integrate all this, making it open and bring it forward as a means to make decision.
3612100	3616100	We don't need to collect that much more information.
3616100	3620100	We need to systematize it and maybe change the hierarchy.
3620100	3624100	That is, maybe even the information, the environmental information already exists.
3624100	3628100	It's just that it's not considered decision making.
3628100	3630100	We would have to bring that forward.
3630100	3638100	So that's one thing that for me, the information gathering part is not a major issue.
3638100	3644100	Making it so that we can actually process all this.
3644100	3646100	That's a big challenge.
3646100	3647100	I agree with that.
3647100	3650100	But the information itself, not too big.
3650100	3653100	But what you are getting at is deeper than this.
3653100	3654100	And it's a major question.
3654100	3659100	And maybe, maybe some of you will have the perfect answer here.
3659100	3669100	But I would say that's still something we're thinking about how to figure out arbitrage between different different options in a sense.
3669100	3676100	Like if we have different processes, different ways to make the same thing, for example, we want to grow tomatoes, right?
3676100	3677100	We like to make those.
3677100	3680100	We want to have them grown in our community.
3680100	3681100	Okay.
3681100	3683100	But then we'll have different ways of doing it.
3683100	3691100	Maybe more water, less human work just to make it very simple or less water, more human work.
3691100	3695100	That's going to have to be a decision that we make.
3695100	3697100	Either way, we could have a tomato.
3697100	3702100	Currently, as you were saying, we'll have market forces determine sort of price of different things.
3702100	3705100	And then we might make on a financial basis.
3705100	3711100	Decide that because financially that brings us to the lowest cost, let's say, or the simplest way to do things.
3711100	3713100	So that's how the arbitrage is done.
3713100	3718100	But because those market prices don't make don't take into consideration all sorts of factors, they're incomplete.
3718100	3721100	They're not they're not the proper way to go about this.
3721100	3724100	But the different options still exist, right?
3724100	3734100	The fact that we have this social metabolism framework in place does not reduce ways of doing things or alternatives to simply one.
3734100	3736100	And then we just follow that.
3736100	3738100	We'll still have to make decisions on that.
3738100	3747100	Now, of course, there's the broad boundaries that we were talking about that cannot be surpassed in any event, right?
3747100	3750100	Whatever we choose to do, whatever we do, we can't go beyond that.
3750100	3752100	Otherwise, stuff keeps working.
3752100	3755100	But how do we actually do the arbitration?
3755100	3764100	Who gets to decide that the fridge makers get that much and that the other people get that much and the tomato growers get that much and all that?
3764100	3774100	Once again, I don't think there's much shortcut around having a political discussions about what priorities end up being.
3774100	3779100	So in a sense, the technique does not give a proper answer to that.
3779100	3782100	The technique gives a set of options, a set of alternatives.
3782100	3792100	And then we get to decide together how we make the arbitrage, what our priorities are, what we deem important or less important thing within the limits.
3792100	3796100	So in the abstract, that's that's that would be my entry point to the question.
3796100	3799100	But it's, of course, not simple.
3799100	3801100	Maybe that's where we disagree.
3801100	3803100	I don't know. I would say disagree.
3803100	3804100	I agree with the idea.
3804100	3807100	OK, first information question.
3807100	3809100	I think Mathieu is right.
3809100	3816100	It's it's not a simple question in terms of it's easy to do, but it's quite easy to conceive.
3816100	3820100	But it will take a lot of work and a lot of time to accomplish.
3820100	3830100	But in a way, at separated in two streams that we have to follow, let's say we put together an economy that is democratically planned economy tomorrow.
3830100	3843100	We will start asking a production unit to give the information about the products that they're getting to a common database, saying, for example, taking your example of the microphone.
3843100	3849100	I've built the base of the microphone or the internal the internal product that there is in it.
3849100	3855100	I used that they were coming from this this plant and this old plant and blah, blah, blah.
3855100	3860100	And we get the information from those other work units and we put them together.
3860100	3865100	And at the end, we have the total of where it comes from and what it has done in the beginning.
3865100	3873100	It'll take time because we'll have to integrate work unit into this database and everyone to give its information and all that.
3873100	3877100	It won't be one year thing. It'll take time to develop.
3877100	3884100	But at the same time, in the second stream, we have micro data and we have we have averages.
3884100	3886100	We have ideas of what's happening.
3886100	3889100	Like we know how many microphones we produce.
3889100	3894100	We know how many how much steel, how much plastic we use every year.
3894100	3901100	We can do divisions and average to have a broad idea of what goes in which sector of the of the economy.
3901100	3907100	And in those sector, what kind of product are being done with each thing?
3907100	3923100	So even for planning at the beginning, we can rely on those larger let's say those larger entities to give us an idea of where we're going while we build the more precise and detailed vision.
3923100	3933100	So I think if we go both ways, if we have those both stream like detailing more and more the macro one and building on the micro one,
3933100	3938100	I think we can get to a level of information that will be interesting.
3938100	3945100	Then on decision making, I agree with Mathieu that some question will be political in the end.
3945100	3956100	But I think that we will add so many constraints coming from a different sort from from different factors, from different different factors.
3956100	3958100	And I'll give you examples.
3958100	3963100	So we add one constraint that we agreed on already is the macro one.
3963100	3968100	We decide collectively we don't want to do this on an on an environmental basis.
3968100	3974100	We want to consume consume less of this material because it's polluting, et cetera, et cetera.
3974100	3976100	So that that's one starting point.
3976100	3986100	Then we have the man will still have people wanting to consume fridges or cars or whatever or, you know, the things they want to consume.
3986100	3988100	We have this information already.
3988100	3995100	And we know people need, for example, to eat apples and to to buy other stuff.
3995100	3998100	So that's an information that we already have.
3998100	4006100	And then we have the preferences from the work from the production units that say we we want to do this or we want to do that.
4006100	4008100	So we want to less work hour.
4008100	4010100	We want to work less hours.
4010100	4019100	Sorry, we want to have to we have innovated into doing that specific way of doing a fridge.
4020100	4028100	As Matthew was saying, there are many options to produce something, but those options are limited in terms of numbers.
4028100	4031100	Like there's three, four or five ways to do something.
4031100	4035100	But there are not like three thousand or ten thousands.
4035100	4039100	So you can you can say, OK, this is what we need.
4039100	4046100	This is the scope of what we need to produce that amount of fridges or of cars or whatever.
4046100	4056100	Hence, when you put all that together and when everyone has participated in saying what they need and what they want and the resources we have,
4056100	4064100	there are still political questions to be resolved like economic question to be resolved politically in a discussion.
4064100	4071100	But you also have a lot of answers coming already from the data you've accumulated together.
4071100	4077100	And that that does not come from a central planning process that comes from a decentral planning process.
4077100	4079100	And you put them all together.
4079100	4089100	Then a few answer comes up enough, I think, for us not to to make all decisions politically,
4089100	4095100	because if we were to make all decisions of the economic system politically, we'll have no time.
4095100	4097100	We would have no time to do this.
4097100	4106100	If we have some questions that must be fixed by by by the relationship between the constraint the economy will be in,
4106100	4111100	those constraints will be in part political because we will have decided that before.
4111100	4117100	We would have, say, three years ago, we want to reach that goal and we have that limit.
4117100	4126100	But still, it it will give us a shortcut in in the current planning to say, OK, we cannot consume more than this.
4126100	4128100	Therefore, we have to make a decision.
4128100	4134100	And and when we'll have two or three options, we'll take a look at what do people want?
4134100	4136100	What is this polluting?
4136100	4142100	And we'll have a few criteria's we can be based on to take decision.
4142100	4149100	And some of them will will need to be made politically at the local, regional or national level.
4149100	4158100	Maybe I wanted to add something on that, because, Simon, now you kind of talked about demand as something a bit like if it was given,
4158100	4163100	people want stuff they want, maybe fridges or cars.
4163100	4167100	And then we'll have to we take this into the planning process.
4167100	4173100	Yes, in a democratic way and then doing something about that and figuring out how we organize this.
4173100	4180100	But I would add that, of course, there also needs to be broader reflections, maybe also on on the longer term,
4180100	4191100	but also on a on a short term basis about this consumption and the role it has in the fulfillment of specific needs.
4191100	4198100	And that's, of course, a whole branch of discussions and debates about planning that we are also working on.
4198100	4206100	The fact that the consumption has to be put into context, into the social provisioning systems.
4206100	4216100	And so there has to be discussions on what are what we consider to be basic needs and then how we want to satisfy those
4216100	4225100	and then how to organize this collectively, this satisfaction of these needs in a way that would be compatible with, of course,
4225100	4229100	the ecological goals or targets that we set ourselves.
4229100	4238100	And then that's also a way to get outside from only always responding to a certain demand, people wanting things,
4238100	4253100	but also to first organize social provisioning in a way that is sustainable and ensures that everyone can have the basic things to survive and thrive in a society.
4253100	4264100	Absolutely. I think that's a really important remark, Sophie, because I mean, I'm quite involved in the debate around democratic planning as well.
4264100	4282100	But sometimes I ask myself if the focus might not be a bit off in terms of we will have a huge sector, hopefully, that is simply like organized through mechanisms of universal provision.
4282100	4288100	You know, it will still need to have some form of, you know, organizing principle, of course.
4288100	4302100	But at least in my book, most of the needs that I have will be covered through a very, very broad understanding of universal basic services, which are unconditional.
4302100	4324100	And compared to that, the much more smaller amount of like everyday consumption of maybe some luxury goods or something is in terms of especially material throughput, much smaller, hopefully, than the amount of throughput that is covered through different means.
4324100	4327100	So this is a really important remark that you made, Sophie.
4327100	4342100	Nonetheless, for both of these realms of all of the realms, we will have to have some form of, as we already established, accounting system or some kind of tracking system, so to speak.
4342100	4351100	And maybe as a last question in this direction, there's always a huge fuss around the question of universal unit of account.
4351100	4362100	Yes or no, I get the sense that you are firmly placed in the direction of no universal unit of account, but maybe units of account in plural.
4362100	4378100	I didn't really understand whether or not this what you're proposing involves some form of artificial unit or if it's like going full calculation in kind.
4378100	4390100	So is there an idea that you have about this kind of technical question of whether or not there will be a unit of account or not?
4390100	4407100	Because this, of course, kind of opens up a box of questions that are attached to how you relate this artificial accounting mechanism to the biophysical elements and so on and so on.
4407100	4414100	So what's your take on this question of unit or units of account?
4414100	4424100	Well, I can try a first take at this, but it's for me personally, and it's not something we have at the center of our research questions right now.
4424100	4430100	But for me personally, it's not such an important question as the debate makes it right now.
4430100	4436100	For one reason is that we can there again go both ways.
4436100	4447100	We can have a universal unit that would look like consumption credits, like you have that amount of credit for your own consumption.
4447100	4454100	And that because it's quite useful to have an idea of how much you can consume, what you can buy with this.
4454100	4459100	And, you know, it's something that in the day to day life can be useful.
4459100	4478100	But it's obvious that when we talk about investments, for example, to take like the completely opposite usage of that kind of units of account, when you think about when you think about investment, you want to take into account a multiplicity of factors and of indicators.
4478100	4487100	But maybe that in your current, you were talking about needs and goods that we that we want to consume when you are in your day to day activities.
4487100	4500100	Maybe you don't want to have 18 different factors when you buy, you know, one one product and say, well, do I can I buy this amount of of iron?
4501100	4508100	You don't want to go there. So having a unit of credit that is simple in the day to day life is totally possible.
4508100	4520100	When on the other side, you do the planning of the investment and the planning of the larger consumptions that you have to do with a variety of units.
4520100	4535100	So for for me personally, there is, yes, a usefulness in something that is universal and that can be used by everybody and that represents the day to day goods that we want goods and services that we want to buy.
4535100	4543100	And on the other side, have a multiplicity of factors and indicators when we talk about larger.
4543100	4551100	It's it's like I would say that I'm taking kind of a bit of a pad divine position here.
4551100	4558100	But like for the day to day market exchange to take is vocabulary.
4558100	4569100	I don't really care if there is a money involved, as long as you cannot accumulate it in obscene ways and things like that, we could we could make limits to all that.
4569100	4576100	But for investments and for important economical matters, I know that it's not sufficient.
4576100	4594100	We need more than this. But I think this will help us know what people prefer, what people because if you use it as theater tickets, as Cotshot and Cutroll would would tell you, we know how many of those of that bread people bought instead of this bread.
4594100	4599100	And therefore we know which one is preferable to invest in.
4599100	4604100	And, you know, it gives you a lot of information that is useful for economic planning.
4604100	4609100	So why not use it? But we we do not have to make it central.
4609100	4613100	We do not have to make it the only decision we take it from.
4613100	4620100	And we don't have to we don't have to make it what money is right now in our system.
4620100	4622100	That's that's what I would go to.
4622100	4626100	Yeah. And to add to this, and of course, we haven't solved everything, right?
4626100	4628100	This is an ongoing project.
4628100	4636100	In fact, right now, some of us are working on prices, like for all the talks we've been saying about how prices can't do everything.
4636100	4640100	They might be useful in a variety of contexts. And that's what we're trying to determine.
4640100	4643100	What are like what's the boundaries of that context?
4643100	4653100	Right. What what realm where can they be useful and we can keep them and what wrong we need to really make decisions on on different basis.
4653100	4661100	And in that way, we can also figure out that if we have this this social metabolic accounting broadly.
4661100	4670100	Right. And if we determine boundaries to production and made decisions about how that production and how that use is going,
4670100	4677100	then exchange or consumption becomes much less of a driver in that sense of of that issue.
4677100	4689100	Right. And so which is why individuals don't have to worry necessarily every single time about the number of units of iron they're actively consuming where they're buying this.
4689100	4701100	If we're saying, OK, we're going to make this whole set of things available in the parts of our economic lives where we're not it's not basic social provisioning.
4701100	4708100	It's not something we're offering, but it's places where people can make choices because between tomatoes and apples, I don't know what.
4708100	4715100	But we set boundaries. And then within that, to have a unit of account that's common to everybody,
4716100	4720100	that allows for individual preferences and all that to be expressed.
4720100	4731100	I think that that's fine. And that can be done in a way that does not go over those ecological boundaries, for example.
4731100	4736100	And that allows for a smooth coordination between people.
4736100	4743100	But it would have to be bounded very precisely what exactly that realm, but within that realm, yes, let's do it.
4743100	4753100	But other decisions, especially with respect to production and resource use and all that, that will need the variety of indicators.
4753100	4758100	And from there, we can't have this simple unit of account.
4759100	4766100	So I think part of the story here is we really need to differentiate those different types of decisions that we're doing.
4766100	4778100	Those production decisions, those resource decisions cannot be made with the same unit of account that we can then use for concerns, at least in my view, again, like we're working on this.
4778100	4782100	But it's important to really differentiate those two things.
4782100	4789100	Whereas currently in the system we have, the one unit of account essentially serves for all these things.
4789100	4796100	And even though it may not be appropriate for all of them at once in the same way.
4796100	4805100	I think maybe just to add on that, that's also maybe why I framed the question in plural of units of account.
4805100	4821100	Because, I mean, one model or at least a broader approach that I might point you towards is that of Tim Plattenkamp, who has a forthcoming book in which he picks up on this separation between consumer credits on the one side,
4821100	4831100	which are, of course, as Simon already pointed towards, have to be thought of as similar to theater tickets, so they will expire after you consume them.
4831100	4838100	So there's a distinction between these consumer credits and production tokens on the other side,
4838100	4852100	which you, Matteo, already pointed towards, that the production type of side of things will need to be handled through different mechanisms in order not to reproduce the problems that easily come up
4852100	4864100	if factors of productions are being handled through the same unit of account as it is done in capitalism with all the problems that go along with this.
4864100	4870100	So, I mean, we kind of touched upon this, but maybe there's something to add.
4870100	4882100	I think the last question already points in this direction. I would be interested in how we can bring together the different logics of different spheres.
4882100	4895100	I mean, you point towards this question when you say that the different elements within the four-step process that you described, namely the points of extraction, the points of production, the points of consumption,
4895100	4905100	and the points of waste, that all of these different points within the process cannot be reduced upon each other,
4905100	4914100	but that they will have to be governed through different inherent logics, so to speak, but then, of course, immediately questions of translation pop up, so to speak.
4914100	4925100	So how can we kind of respect the inherent logics of these different spheres while at the same time create some form of compatibility?
4925100	4931100	So I guess there's a question of what's the word? Intersections.
4931100	4945100	So we will need to find devices or mechanisms or political processes, or I guess these will all be political processes as well, to kind of govern these intersections between the spheres, so to speak.
4945100	4957100	So maybe to kind of open up what we already talked about, because I think this is really important because right now one of the problems we have is that a certain logic,
4957100	4969100	namely the logic of economic efficiency and profit maximization dominates many of the other spheres, and we would, of course, not want to reproduce this,
4969100	4981100	but as I said, this leads to a point where questions of intersection and valuing the values of other logics come up, I guess.
4981100	4995100	Yes, so the cohabitation of different logics, it's interesting that you put it because even in, we often say, okay, well, in our village or our community or our group, we'll do things this way.
4995100	5002100	And how do we talk to the next people? Right. And that's an important question, which I'll address in one second.
5002100	5015100	But what you bring up is very interesting that even within one system, if we say that we have a production logic or a logic with respect to resource use and a different one with respect to consumption,
5015100	5021100	how do these things talk to each other? And I think this is a central question.
5021100	5032100	So we've done some work on this. And what we've come up with is we need some kind of interface, some kind of interface in between those different realms.
5032100	5048100	Or if you think back about what I was talking about with different communities, maybe what like in the current set up, we would say international trade or whatever, because we have this vision of states like doing trade with each other,
5048100	5060100	which, of course, is not really what's happening, but different issue. But even if we have a given system in a locus, how does it communicate to a different system?
5060100	5067100	Because we can imagine that not all at once, everybody will adopt the exact same way. And that's fine, too, right?
5067100	5075100	Even in a transition towards democratic planning, we can easily imagine that one group would go one way and a different group would go in a different direction.
5075100	5083100	So how could different systems communicate with each other? And from that, we'll need to have an interface.
5083100	5095100	And translation can be done in one way by requiring information that the other system might not be producing in and of itself.
5095100	5103100	So that's one part that's important. Just to make it easy, again, going from two communities talking to each other.
5103100	5111100	Assume one is still capitalist and then in one other one, we've tried to do this kind of transition towards a democratically planned system.
5111100	5120100	And we have all these biophysical indicators that we care about, but that are not explicitly taken into account in the capitalist system.
5121100	5138100	How do these two communicate? Well, in order for the democratically planned economy to to really include the possibilities offered by the capitalist economy in its own planning processes,
5138100	5147100	it would need to have all sorts of new information. So that interface, one of its main role in order for that translation to happen, is an information gathering role.
5147100	5154100	So again, coming back to my tomatoes, if we care about water usage and in the other system, they're simply priced.
5154100	5163100	They're saying we're going to sell you tomatoes for two dollars a kilogram, let's say, or perfect. Fine. Great. Good.
5163100	5170100	How much water do you use? Does it take to make a kilogram of tomatoes? Because we care about that.
5170100	5179100	And if we discover that it takes much more water, then that changes sort of the ratio or the actual importance we give this good.
5179100	5193100	So if in our society we have a consumption target as well as a production target, then that good coming through needs to be taken into account in terms of its material flows it would generate.
5193100	5200100	Right. And not only its price, so that water used in order to make it in this case.
5200100	5213100	So the interface first thing gathers all the information so that the indicators that are used in the democratic economy can account for whatever is going on in the economy.
5213100	5220100	At the same time, there needs to be a process designed, at least in my view, such that there's some porosity, right?
5220100	5224100	There's not an isolation of a democratic system. It needs to be protected.
5224100	5231100	But at some point we need to design it so that there's a bit of a competition in good practices, I would say.
5231100	5241100	That is, if the system next door really is using much less water, then maybe it's interesting to get tomatoes from there rather than get tomatoes at home.
5241100	5249100	If ever, for whatever reason, we feel as a society that tomatoes are very useful and are needed in that society.
5249100	5254100	Once we have taken into account those biophysical indicators, social indicators as well, right?
5254100	5262100	What kind of work conditions? All these indicators, once we can translate, then we can make a decision and include it in the broader processing.
5262100	5271100	OK, well, we have options A, B, and C to make tomatoes at home that require arbitrage between different dimensions and all that.
5271100	5279100	But there's also option D. We could get the tomatoes from next door. And here's what it means.
5279100	5288100	But then if we get tomatoes from outside, what does it mean in terms of our consumption targets, in terms of our production targets as well?
5289100	5297100	They'll want something for the tomatoes, right? So in the same way, we need to consider material flows in both directions.
5297100	5308100	So it's a little bit the same thing. So that's one way to conceive it in between communities, I would say, with different economic systems.
5308100	5316100	Because in a sense, we'll need global planning to figure out environmental problems on a global scale like carbon, as we're seeing these days.
5316100	5324100	Certainly. Eventually, hopefully we'll get there. But in the meantime, a community will have power over whatever it does, right?
5324100	5329100	We don't want some kind of imperialist setup, whereas, well, we're pure environmentally speaking.
5329100	5336100	So we're going to tell you how to do stuff, right? This cannot be the solution in a way.
5336100	5345100	So if we decide for ourselves, we set those targets, we have this interface, collect information, figure out the arbitrage, made those decisions within our own planning process.
5345100	5358100	That's one way to do it. And also translate the units. In terms of your question internally, it has a similar logic with interfaces in between those different steps, I would say.
5358100	5365100	But it's slightly different in that we have a broad vision of all of these moments, right?
5366100	5375100	The social metabolic view says that we need to consider every single one of these moments.
5375100	5380100	So one does not happen in complete isolation with the other.
5380100	5385100	But to give a quick example, again, suppose we go from production to consumption.
5385100	5399100	And in consumption, we have this unit of account common to everybody in common to every product that does not have to consider every single dimension every time, but that we can use some kind of currency.
5399100	5407100	And in the production processes, we have all sorts of indicators that are more biophotographically based.
5407100	5418100	Then we can imagine a process whereby we set boundaries and we make decisions with respect to arbitrage, with respect to resource use, before it gets to consumption, right?
5418100	5425100	At which point we have a broad quantitative division of what will be available for consumption.
5425100	5434100	And then allocation within the consumption moment can take place with a different currency that does not have to be linked.
5434100	5439100	We'll have to talk about distribution, of course, who gets what in terms of allocation, obviously.
5439100	5453100	But aside from that, we can then have a different process whereby stuff is like exchange distributed allocated according to this different unit without having this unit to talk to the other one explicitly every time.
5453100	5459100	So that's a bit of this interface vision we can think of.
5460100	5471100	A question that we did not yet touch upon, but that you do have work currently only in French about is the question of needs.
5471100	5479100	This is, of course, again, a huge question. We are talking about a lot of huge questions today, which is great, I think.
5479100	5483100	So you published a paper about the question of needs.
5483100	5499100	And to me, when reading some of the bits that were kindly translated for me by Simone, I kind of got the idea that the conclusion more or less seems to be A, let's cover the basics first,
5499100	5509100	and B, let's talk about what the basics are and kind of engage in a political process about this question specifically.
5509100	5514100	So maybe you could walk us through your findings when it comes to the question of needs.
5514100	5519100	Well, it has been a question for us since the beginning of our discussions.
5520100	5532100	Needs keeps coming back at this. And I think you brought it yourself, Jan, when talking about what you thought should be covered by a universal provisioning system.
5532100	5539100	This is another way of putting the question of needs at the center.
5539100	5545100	What I would say is that our first question was a question of needs definition.
5545100	5553100	And there's a lot that has been written on this. We made a literature review on needs and needs coverage.
5553100	5563100	And not only is it talked a lot in economics, but not that much because some parts of the economic realm are not talking about needs really much.
5563100	5567100	But a lot of people do and a lot of people do in other disciplines as well.
5567100	5572100	Anthropology, even nursing has very interesting things to say about us.
5572100	5575100	You have tons of things written about us.
5575100	5587100	But the problem is that there is still this idea that we could get access to a very scientific and objective human need.
5587100	5600100	So the first thing we wanted to do is debunk that idea that there is a person somewhere or a collection of people that could provide us with this is what human needs.
5600100	5607100	This does not exist, obviously. Human needs are partly cultural, partly subjective.
5607100	5613100	And that's all right. They are still needs. It's not because they're not objective that they're not needs.
5613100	5624100	But there is another school that is saying if they are partly subjective, therefore there is no difference between needs and the rest.
5624100	5628100	The needs are anything that we can desire.
5628100	5635100	And we disagree, too, with this definition because we were saying, well, not really.
5635100	5640100	And we all know that needs and desire are different.
5640100	5652100	I can need something and if I don't have it, I'm putting myself in danger, for example, or I won't live as long as I should or, you know, I will put my health in trouble.
5652100	5660100	And desires, well, it's things that I would love to have, but it's not necessary that I have them.
5660100	5665100	Even though it's not objective, we know that there's a difference.
5665100	5677100	And we know in the end, and that's where Nancy Fraser's text from the 90s, I think we are kind of nostalgic and work only on text from the 90s, but that's another question.
5677100	5693100	We took that text from Nancy Fraser and she wrote a bunch of them about the notion that the definition of needs in our society, in capitalist society, is a struggle.
5693100	5697100	There is a struggle over needs interpretation in our society.
5698100	5707100	And I'm really happy that Nancy Fraser chose the word need in terms of the word rights.
5707100	5711100	And I think it helps us in understanding what we're talking about.
5711100	5719100	And we're not talking about human rights or natural rights where liberalism comes in and then it fucks up all the discussion.
5719100	5725100	Then we need to have a discussion about what we think we need.
5725100	5732100	And this discussion will be, and that's what Fraser brings in, it will be political in the end.
5732100	5740100	We will have to, yes, we will be helped by science, like science has a lot of things to say about what human needs.
5740100	5745100	But in the end, to agree upon something, we will have to discuss it.
5745100	5750100	So it comes to what you were saying, but in a very convoluted way, but still it comes to what you were saying.
5750100	5758100	It's that we have to discuss about need to select, to define what needs are in our community.
5758100	5768100	But we think it will be very useful for a planning process to have that unit, to say this is what we need.
5768100	5777100	This will give us what is the most basic production we must do to cover our needs.
5777100	5782100	And this gives us the line Sophie in the beginning talked about two lines.
5782100	5788100	One line is the planet boundaries that we cannot go over that.
5788100	5798100	That's kind of our roof and the ground where we have another things we can go under is fulfilling human needs.
5798100	5804100	We don't want people to die out of hunger or be in a difficult situation in terms of health.
5804100	5809100	Hence, our production and consumption must be between those two lines.
5809100	5815100	And we did this, Richard, to say, how do we define the bottom line?
5815100	5827100	And this bottom line has to be defined politically and has to be thought of in terms of this universal provisioning that you were thinking about.
5827100	5836100	Not only because, as Mathieu was saying, we need some space to make our own decision, even according to our needs.
5836100	5841100	Like if you're talking about my health, yeah, I want to make a certain decision.
5841100	5848100	At some point, someone will decide for me if what's best for me is to have a treatment for cancer.
5848100	5853100	Well, I don't have much decisions to make. I can take it or not.
5853100	5856100	But that's about it. I will not choose this treatment or this one.
5856100	5861100	But when it comes to food, I can prefer apples to oranges.
5861100	5865100	And I want some leeway to decide which one is better for me.
5865100	5873100	Even though a nutritionist could tell me that I should eat this, I still want to have some space to decide.
5874100	5882100	Hence, there is this space that we're trying to define that is not exactly this is what we need first.
5882100	5887100	In terms of like chronologically, we wouldn't need to fulfill the needs.
5887100	5893100	And then when all the needs of everyone are done, we'll start thinking about what we do next.
5893100	5898100	Obviously, it's not that way. But we know that we cannot go under this limit.
5898100	5904100	So it's to trace a limit and also to ask a very complex question.
5904100	5911100	And I think I'm reading right now Simone Sutturletti and Stephen Merritt's book.
5911100	5915100	And I think that they approach that question in a very interesting fashion.
5915100	5925100	One that I hadn't seen before about the willingness or what they call voluntariness of fulfilling the work
5925100	5929100	that has to be done for us to cover our needs.
5929100	5932100	And this is a tricky question.
5932100	5940100	When we put the ground level, when we said we need to have those needs fulfilled and covered,
5940100	5946100	who will do the work so it is fulfilled and covered?
5946100	5951100	And what do we do with the people who say, well, I don't want to work for that
5951100	5956100	when we need work to be done for everyone to be able to eat?
5956100	5958100	It's a tricky question.
5958100	5967100	But I think that at least our research is bringing it back in when we normally try to avoid it.
5967100	5974100	And I'm thinking, for example, at the three canonical models where this question is when it's treated,
5974100	5979100	treated in one or two sentences and very problematically, I think.
5979100	5984100	So we're bringing that back and asking the question, OK, what do we do with this?
5984100	5987100	Bringing the question doesn't mean we have answers.
5987100	5993100	But at least we are discussing this very specific question.
5993100	5996100	And how can we focus on that?
5996100	5999100	So that's where the needs in our discussion.
5999100	6007100	And I think that there will be a process when the question of need will be asked politically
6007100	6016100	to include more and more things, more and more services and goods in what we need
6016100	6020100	from a political perspective, people will say.
6020100	6029100	And at some point, I think this is the transition that we talk normally in classical socialist theory
6029100	6031100	between socialism and communism.
6031100	6034100	But the transition will be slow.
6034100	6041100	It's the moment where we will be saying, OK, it's normal for people to have this for a living.
6041100	6043100	Is it vacations?
6043100	6045100	You know, we did that already.
6045100	6050100	It's already in Northern society and in the global north.
6050100	6051100	We did that already.
6051100	6053100	This discussion already happened.
6053100	6059100	But I think this will go in a larger way and it will grow with the time.
6059100	6064100	But we will think about it consciously, knowing that there are limits.
6064100	6069100	So it's not everybody does everything and anything he wants.
6069100	6077100	It's we have to think about living harmoniously with the environment we're in.
6077100	6081100	So we cannot fulfill every desire.
6081100	6084100	It needs to be thought of as needs.
6085100	6090100	So that's more or less the reflections we were having.
6090100	6095100	And probably Sophie and Mathieu want to add things into that.
6095100	6097100	I can't hear you, Sophie.
6097100	6101100	Yeah, I wanted to say I didn't have anything to add for now.
6101100	6103100	No, it's the same for me.
6103100	6105100	I think you did a good job.
6105100	6110100	OK, so there's a last question that I ask all of my guests.
6110100	6113100	And it is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
6113100	6115100	Well, I can take a stab at that one.
6115100	6124100	In a sense, for me, what makes me joyful when I think about the future is potentialities.
6124100	6137100	When we think about the environment, it's really easy to get the dreary vision of the whole world disintegrating around us and this thing descending into chaos.
6138100	6147100	We can think about the oft-repeated sentence that it's easier to imagine the end of the world and the end of capitalism in some ways.
6147100	6162100	But at the same time, when we start looking around, what we see is people, communities collectively designing new responses every day to the challenges that come.
6162100	6175100	So this human potentiality that even with challenges that we can't even think of right now, those we can see are already important enough,
6175100	6187100	but that humans will be able to devise answers, to devise solutions to that, to devise unforeseen and unforeseeable response.
6187100	6202100	So in a sense, the prospect of being astonished and impressed as to what we'll be able collectively to come up with to address these challenges, yeah, that would make me joyful.
6202100	6205100	I had a similar answer to that.
6205100	6211100	Yeah, indeed, I think for sure there'll be hard times and challenges ahead, for sure.
6211100	6229100	But I think that if we think that we can organize right now and build strong solidarity networks, for sure there will be a powerful resistance to whatever will be happening and also beautiful alternatives that will emerge out of it.
6229100	6250100	And I think for me, so it's not so much the fact of being surprised, but more of seeing these powerful acts of resistance and organizing and also creating these alternative prospects and alternative proposals that will necessarily happen and emerge out of this that makes me joyful.
6250100	6258100	I think that when we think about the future, there's two kinds of people and I will resume that into two utopias.
6258100	6269100	There is one side that is Edward Bellamy kind of side, techno utopian people that think that we will live a better life.
6269100	6282100	In fact, it will be kind of a retro futuristic life where everything will be done by machines and all that, but it will be still communism and will be all equal and all that.
6282100	6290100	This is more the William Morris side, News from Nowhere being the fiction I would be thinking about.
6290100	6299100	And I think I'm more on this side, which is what rejoices me is that life will be simpler.
6299100	6326100	I envision a world where we will have, and I won't do the classic Marx quote here, but where we will have time for just enjoying life for itself, taking time with friends, reading philosophy, discussing, and having less burden imposed by a system that is exterior to our will.
6326100	6336100	And we were, yes, as my two colleagues said, we will have more of a say into it, but also more time.
6336100	6354100	We have a very short amount of time on this earth. And the fact that we spend it pursuing goals that are totally, that have no consequences in terms of happiness that we have, that we give to other people around us, it's just stupid.
6354100	6362100	I hope for a system where we have time to enjoy life for real and enjoying it for real is really simple, in fact.
6362100	6367100	It's time with people you love. It's time with friends. It's time with learning.
6367100	6374100	And I hope that a system that we build together as a humanity comes to this kind of maturity.
6374100	6384100	I think that humanity can look at itself at some moment and say we could spend more time doing those things instead of pursuing the evaluation of value.
6384100	6386100	Yeah, that's it.
