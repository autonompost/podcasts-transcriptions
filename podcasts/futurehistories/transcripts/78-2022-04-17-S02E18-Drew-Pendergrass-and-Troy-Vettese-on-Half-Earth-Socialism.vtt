00:00.480 --> 00:01.840
Welcome to Future Histories.

00:01.840 --> 00:03.400
My name is Jan Groos,

00:03.400 --> 00:05.800
and it is my great pleasure to welcome

00:05.800 --> 00:09.620
Troy Witteze and Drew Pendergrass in today's episode.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.840
They are the authors of the newly released book,

00:12.840 --> 00:15.080
Half-Earth Socialism.

00:15.080 --> 00:19.440
And since Troy and Drew do see democratic economic planning

00:19.440 --> 00:21.920
as an integral part of what they propose

00:21.920 --> 00:25.760
as Half-Earth Socialism, I was intrigued to read it.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.740
And it has been an interesting read for me, I have to say,

00:28.740 --> 00:32.180
because there are quite some elements in it

00:32.180 --> 00:35.360
that I kind of stumbled over, I would say.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.620
And this is, of course, always great for a good interview

00:38.620 --> 00:40.440
and an interesting discussion.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.620
We didn't really touch the veganism aspect

00:43.620 --> 00:45.020
of their proposal in detail.

00:45.020 --> 00:48.060
I'll leave that to others to discuss.

00:48.060 --> 00:52.020
But we did go into planning, of course, in quite some detail.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.760
And I think it made an interesting exchange.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.920
I certainly enjoyed talking to Troy and to Drew,

00:58.920 --> 01:01.840
and I hope you will enjoy listening to it.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.240
Before we start, I would like to thank David, Fabian,

01:05.240 --> 01:07.960
Lucas, and Wilfried for their donations.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.760
And I would like to welcome BjÃ¶rn, Manuel, and Gereon

01:10.760 --> 01:12.640
as patrons of Future Histories.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.320
Thank you so much.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.120
If you want to support Future Histories,

01:16.120 --> 01:19.720
but you do not have the monetary resources to do so,

01:19.720 --> 01:22.080
then first of all, thank you too.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.420
It's highly appreciated.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.900
And then there is an absolutely brilliant way

01:26.900 --> 01:29.860
to support the project in non-monetary form

01:29.860 --> 01:33.060
by transcribing your favorite episode.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.980
There's a collaborative transcription project

01:35.980 --> 01:38.060
that has formed around Future Histories,

01:38.060 --> 01:42.060
and I want to thank everybody who has already contributed.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.160
So if there's an episode you like,

01:44.160 --> 01:47.520
and you see a value in providing a transcript of the episode,

01:47.520 --> 01:51.760
and I would argue there are many benefits from a transcript,

01:51.780 --> 01:54.700
then please find a link and a contact email

01:54.700 --> 01:55.980
in the show notes.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.800
So go for it, and thank you.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.920
But now please enjoy today's episode

02:00.920 --> 02:03.360
with Drew Pendergrass and Troy Wieteser

02:03.360 --> 02:06.160
on Half-Earth Socialism.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.320
["Half-Earth Socialism"]

02:11.440 --> 02:12.280
Welcome, Troy.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.840
Welcome, Drew.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.560
Thanks for having us.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.000
It's a pleasure.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.520
Let's start with the definition.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.280
What is Half-Earth Socialism?

02:21.280 --> 02:25.560
Half-Earth Socialism is a kind of socialism

02:25.560 --> 02:29.320
based on the recognition of ecological limits,

02:29.320 --> 02:31.640
but also the limits to our understanding

02:31.640 --> 02:33.520
of the natural world.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.520
And therefore, we're saying that the environmental crisis

02:39.340 --> 02:41.700
can only become overcome by socialism

02:41.700 --> 02:44.840
because it is only socialism that humans can decide

02:44.840 --> 02:46.960
to manage economic growth,

02:46.960 --> 02:49.640
which is impossible under capitalism.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.640
And then we're also saying that socialists

02:53.640 --> 02:55.880
have to be environmentalists

02:55.880 --> 02:58.480
because they have to realize

02:58.480 --> 03:00.800
that total control over nature is impossible

03:00.800 --> 03:02.400
because the more we intervene in nature,

03:02.400 --> 03:03.600
the more risks we take,

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
such as pandemics or climate change.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.240
So Half-Earth Socialism is that in a nutshell,

03:09.240 --> 03:11.960
and it's also arguing for noiratian,

03:11.960 --> 03:14.360
no conscious control of the economy.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.580
And we propose rewilding half the planet,

03:18.580 --> 03:20.260
which is the Half-Earth component,

03:20.260 --> 03:25.100
and having energy quotas and veganism

03:25.100 --> 03:28.620
to reduce our impact on nature

03:28.620 --> 03:31.140
while also ensuring a good life for all.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.420
I actually know if I have anything to add.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.820
Troy, you did a very good definition.

03:35.820 --> 03:36.660
Thanks.

03:37.540 --> 03:40.900
And before you set out to describe your ideas

03:40.900 --> 03:43.800
about how to address climate catastrophe in the book,

03:43.800 --> 03:46.020
you dissect some other approaches,

03:46.020 --> 03:47.660
three approaches actually,

03:47.660 --> 03:49.420
that are brought forward by others.

03:49.420 --> 03:53.860
And those are bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration,

03:53.860 --> 03:57.140
it's short B-E-C-C-S, nuclear power,

03:57.140 --> 04:00.640
and the idea of Half-Earth itself, actually,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.860
because the origins of this idea of Half-Earth

04:03.860 --> 04:05.700
are not quite innocent.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.580
And there are strands tied to this concept

04:09.580 --> 04:14.540
that have, I think, some quite Malthusian ring to it,

04:14.540 --> 04:18.940
as well as some nativist tendencies, if I'm not mistaken.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.620
So these are three approaches that you dissect

04:22.620 --> 04:26.160
before you lay out your own proposal within the book.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.220
Maybe let's take a look at these three approaches,

04:30.220 --> 04:33.600
and maybe you can tell us what the shortcomings

04:33.600 --> 04:37.180
of these quote unquote solutions are.

04:37.180 --> 04:41.500
Yeah, so you're describing here our kind of look at

04:42.500 --> 04:44.780
the sort of half solutions on offer

04:44.780 --> 04:49.700
by sort of mainstream environmental slash modeling.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.260
So we can take them in turn.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.460
So the first option, BEX,

04:53.460 --> 04:58.340
is an interesting kind of modeling artifact.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.780
So the idea with bioengineering

04:59.780 --> 05:01.500
with carbon capture and storage, or BEX,

05:01.500 --> 05:05.260
is that you have plantations of probably trees,

05:05.260 --> 05:07.100
and then you cut these down,

05:07.100 --> 05:09.740
you burn it for energy, for electricity,

05:09.740 --> 05:12.280
you capture the carbon emitted from the trees,

05:12.280 --> 05:14.220
and then you bury that carbon underground.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.900
And the idea is that this is a carbon negative energy source

05:16.900 --> 05:19.820
because the carbon released by the trees,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.620
the trees capture carbon, they grow,

05:21.620 --> 05:24.660
capture that carbon, you put it underground.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.900
And this is, believe it or not,

05:26.900 --> 05:30.220
integral to pretty much all of the intergovernmental panel

05:30.220 --> 05:34.780
on climate change, IPCC's 1.5 degree models.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.740
So limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees,

05:37.740 --> 05:40.500
and even a lot of the two degree models,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.660
the idea is that they're trying to model

05:42.660 --> 05:44.260
how you might do this energy transition.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.020
It's very hard to do a massive transition very quickly.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.940
So a lot of the models have overshoot

05:48.940 --> 05:50.940
or emit too much or something,

05:50.940 --> 05:52.620
and you need to have negative emissions

05:52.620 --> 05:54.420
to push you back down.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.020
They're often very large amounts of negative emissions.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.700
So the models produce,

05:58.700 --> 06:00.220
these are models that are running blindly.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.820
They're just neoclassical models

06:01.820 --> 06:03.460
with a climate model attached.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.500
And they kind of blindly are like,

06:04.580 --> 06:06.580
okay, let's take three India's worth of land,

06:06.580 --> 06:08.980
plant some tree plantations, burn it.

06:08.980 --> 06:10.140
Let's make some nice assumptions

06:10.140 --> 06:11.540
that this is a carbon negative,

06:11.540 --> 06:13.660
like that there's not an unintended consequence

06:13.660 --> 06:18.660
by like say, soils control a lot of the biosphere's carbon.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.980
Maybe by doing this, we might mess up the soils

06:20.980 --> 06:23.500
and the soils might start emitting carbon,

06:23.500 --> 06:24.700
bracket all that.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.260
And then if you do this, okay, you have a nice solution.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.100
You can have your energy transition

06:29.100 --> 06:30.820
with a lot of fruit to spare.

06:30.820 --> 06:33.860
And the bottom line is this is sort of

06:33.900 --> 06:36.060
obviously never going to happen.

06:36.060 --> 06:41.060
It's a massive project with no movement behind it.

06:41.820 --> 06:46.020
It's just, it's a modeling artifact.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.540
And if anything, it's harder to do the energy transition

06:48.540 --> 06:49.820
than these models make it sound

06:49.820 --> 06:53.580
because BEX is so integral to many of these models.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.180
Now there are models that don't involve BEX

06:55.180 --> 06:57.700
and they involve a much more rapid energy transition.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.580
And that's more aligned with what we are talking about,

07:00.580 --> 07:03.980
things like large amounts of energy use reductions.

07:05.580 --> 07:09.140
The second proposal that we talk about is nuclear power.

07:09.140 --> 07:12.460
And we're more specifically talking to a specific strain

07:12.460 --> 07:14.740
of environmentalists who wants to build

07:14.740 --> 07:17.180
like a nuclear power plant a week or something like this,

07:17.180 --> 07:18.380
or maybe even more.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.980
There's two nuclear power plants a week,

07:20.980 --> 07:21.860
Troy is telling me.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.540
Yeah, so the idea is,

07:23.540 --> 07:27.020
we build up this massive electricity capacity

07:27.020 --> 07:30.380
and then together with a big electrification project,

07:31.220 --> 07:32.060
you solve the climate crisis

07:32.060 --> 07:35.220
by putting everything on this big nuclear power grid.

07:35.220 --> 07:39.860
But this is also seems a little bit ridiculous.

07:40.780 --> 07:42.700
For one thing, nuclear power plants are very hard

07:42.700 --> 07:46.420
and expensive to build and very complex machines.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.780
And we said in the book that

07:48.780 --> 07:52.020
even if nuclear power plants are safer now,

07:52.020 --> 07:53.700
there's still a pretty high risk

07:53.700 --> 07:56.540
of something like a Fukushima like disaster,

07:56.540 --> 07:59.180
even with our current number of nuclear power plants.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.980
So if you add a bunch more, that risk goes up.

08:02.980 --> 08:05.980
We still haven't solved the nuclear waste problem.

08:05.980 --> 08:08.220
The fact that nuclear power is connected

08:08.220 --> 08:10.500
to nuclear weapons in an intimate way

08:10.500 --> 08:14.420
is also another existential threat to worry about.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.500
And then also the fact that

08:15.500 --> 08:17.580
if you build this many power plants,

08:17.580 --> 08:19.420
you are manning a lot of uranium.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.660
Uranium is a pretty nasty thing to mine.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.300
It gets impure pretty quickly

08:23.300 --> 08:26.060
once you mine out of the good, I guess,

08:26.060 --> 08:28.300
the high quality ores.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.660
And then you end up with some problems

08:31.660 --> 08:33.900
and propose solutions to do different kinds of reactors

08:33.900 --> 08:35.620
like fast speed reactors have problems

08:35.620 --> 08:37.260
because they use sodium as a coolant

08:37.260 --> 08:40.420
and sodium explodes when exposed to air.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.620
And that's just, so we just don't think

08:43.620 --> 08:46.820
that this is a plausible plan.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.380
And then the final one we talk about is the half earth.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.660
And many on the left are familiar

08:51.660 --> 08:56.060
with the difficulties of the conservation movement,

08:56.300 --> 08:58.340
the quite nasty side of it.

08:58.340 --> 09:00.980
And we don't hold any punches here.

09:00.980 --> 09:04.140
So the half earth idea comes out

09:04.140 --> 09:06.060
of an intellectual tradition

09:06.060 --> 09:08.940
that has pretty nasty relationship

09:08.940 --> 09:12.260
with indigenous peoples and this sort of thing.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.900
And E.O. Wilson, who ends up taking it on

09:14.900 --> 09:18.020
and popularizing it in a 2014 book,

09:18.020 --> 09:21.940
he is better than some of these conservationists,

09:21.940 --> 09:22.900
but that's not saying much

09:22.900 --> 09:27.060
because he is quite notorious for his sociobiology

09:27.060 --> 09:32.060
is sort of determinism on the basis of genes

09:32.460 --> 09:33.300
and that sort of thing.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.820
So pretty antithetical to what we believe on the left.

09:36.820 --> 09:40.100
But while interrogating this tradition,

09:40.100 --> 09:43.420
what we think is important is that mass extinction,

09:43.420 --> 09:46.020
the ongoing sixth mass extinction in earth's history

09:46.020 --> 09:49.540
is something that we on the left need to care about.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.220
So the sixth mass extinction is going on now

09:52.220 --> 09:54.020
driven by human activity.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.700
There have been five previous mass extinctions.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.940
They are disastrous for life on earth,

09:58.940 --> 10:01.740
not just because we should care about other species

10:01.740 --> 10:03.980
on this planet, but in terms of...

10:03.980 --> 10:06.700
In science, we call it ecosystem services.

10:06.700 --> 10:11.060
So nature does things for us, like keep the water clean,

10:12.180 --> 10:17.180
pollinate our crops, make sure that disease is kept at bay,

10:18.180 --> 10:21.860
all sorts of vital functions.

10:21.860 --> 10:26.060
And if this ecosystem functioning and also carbon capture,

10:26.060 --> 10:28.500
like half of the carbon we've emitted has been captured

10:28.500 --> 10:30.700
by either the oceans or the land.

10:30.700 --> 10:31.900
Some of that's inorganic,

10:31.900 --> 10:35.140
but a good bit of it is through life on earth.

10:35.140 --> 10:38.060
So these are just parts of the planet

10:38.060 --> 10:39.700
that we can't afford to lose.

10:39.700 --> 10:43.180
And the thing that drives mass extinction,

10:43.180 --> 10:46.060
perhaps the most is habitat loss.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.300
So we need to take seriously the idea

10:49.300 --> 10:52.020
that habitat loss is a problem.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.060
It's driving a major environmental crisis.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.060
It's a crisis that will affect all of us

10:56.060 --> 10:58.860
that affects our prospects of having a good life.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.660
And it affects other species on this planet

11:00.660 --> 11:02.100
that we should care about too.

11:03.100 --> 11:08.020
So basically we shouldn't throw the baby out

11:08.020 --> 11:11.460
with the bath water, but we shouldn't like maybe

11:11.460 --> 11:13.220
not interrogate the bath water, I guess,

11:13.220 --> 11:16.020
to use this metaphor badly.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.620
So we talk about how biodiversity is higher

11:18.620 --> 11:22.820
in indigenous managed lands than nature preserves

11:22.820 --> 11:23.980
in many cases.

11:23.980 --> 11:27.180
So there's no need to inherit these nasty sides

11:27.180 --> 11:30.260
of conservation, but we still need to take seriously

11:30.260 --> 11:32.100
the need to protect nature.

11:33.420 --> 11:36.020
Okay, that's interesting because now you kind

11:36.020 --> 11:41.020
of implicitly already answered a question I had regarding

11:41.700 --> 11:44.300
why you stick to this concept of half earth,

11:44.300 --> 11:49.300
because to me it felt as if maybe because of this history

11:49.780 --> 11:53.220
that this concept has and the line of thinking

11:53.220 --> 11:56.980
that underlies it, which has a, in some parts,

11:56.980 --> 12:01.500
slightly semi-authoritarian touch, I'd say.

12:03.340 --> 12:07.340
It begs the question how to avoid including

12:07.340 --> 12:10.180
these highly problematic aspects of the concept

12:10.180 --> 12:13.060
of half earth, because it's not just the ignorance

12:13.060 --> 12:17.900
towards indigenous knowledges and different other problems

12:17.900 --> 12:22.900
that this conservative conservationist movement has,

12:23.100 --> 12:26.100
but also, at least to me, when reading the book,

12:26.940 --> 12:31.180
you will always come into a position where if you start

12:31.180 --> 12:36.180
by having a very concrete idea of how things should be

12:36.660 --> 12:40.580
in the beginning, you will come into the position

12:40.580 --> 12:45.300
where you will kind of have to construct a system

12:45.300 --> 12:48.700
that necessarily, quote unquote, forces people

12:48.700 --> 12:53.700
into what you believe is the correct answer to the problem.

12:54.420 --> 12:57.860
And so there's a specific line of argument,

12:57.860 --> 13:02.620
a line of reasoning underlying this whole idea

13:02.620 --> 13:05.820
that kind of brings you in the territory

13:05.820 --> 13:09.020
where you will have to confront the question

13:09.020 --> 13:14.020
of, in this case, also central authoritarian tendencies.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.500
But I don't think we're naive liberals here

13:20.500 --> 13:22.980
where we think that, oh, it's just a matter

13:22.980 --> 13:25.860
of individual choice that's gonna solve any of these problems.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.660
I mean, we don't use, we don't think this way

13:27.660 --> 13:28.980
when it comes to fossil fuels.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.380
I think socialists are comfortable enough saying

13:31.380 --> 13:34.860
we have to get rid of fossil fuels quickly,

13:34.860 --> 13:37.260
and that's going to require how we live,

13:37.300 --> 13:38.980
and it's gonna force how a lot of people

13:38.980 --> 13:42.180
who use a lot of fossil fuels to change how they live.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.060
And that's, we're also quite comfortable saying

13:44.060 --> 13:46.940
we want equality, that means no more rich people.

13:46.940 --> 13:49.180
I mean, we're happy saying all these things,

13:49.180 --> 13:52.460
but when it comes to meat or the animal question in general,

13:52.460 --> 13:55.700
then people say, oh, hey, you can't say that.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.300
And I think on the left, we need to have a real discussion

13:59.300 --> 14:04.300
about what is a socialist ethic towards animals

14:05.020 --> 14:09.900
and what is the relationship we want with animals.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.660
And this book tries to push that forward.

14:11.660 --> 14:15.180
But we make clear in the book that our approach

14:15.180 --> 14:17.180
or what we're arguing in the book

14:17.180 --> 14:18.700
is really two separate things.

14:18.700 --> 14:23.700
One is a way to think about what socialism is and practice.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.300
And this is where we draw Noirat.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.780
He's saying it's important to have this utopian tradition

14:28.780 --> 14:31.260
where people come up with total plans

14:31.260 --> 14:32.860
or what he calls like social engineering,

14:32.900 --> 14:36.780
and then people compare these utopian future plans

14:36.780 --> 14:39.740
and then vote on them and they decide upon them.

14:39.740 --> 14:42.020
And versus, and the second part would be

14:42.020 --> 14:44.060
what we think those future plans should be.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.780
We offer our own future plan.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.500
But we say quite clearly,

14:47.500 --> 14:49.420
also because at some level we have no power,

14:49.420 --> 14:50.820
we can't force anyone to do anything.

14:50.820 --> 14:55.820
But we say, if you don't agree with us, that's fine.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.860
But then we have to make trade-off somewhere.

14:58.860 --> 15:01.180
We have to say, okay, we're happy to have

15:01.180 --> 15:04.860
synodic disease and mass extinction, and that's okay.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.700
Or we have to live with more nuclear power plants.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.900
And it's, you know, maybe as we can't produce enough energy

15:10.900 --> 15:14.060
for easily high energy quotas or whatever it is,

15:14.060 --> 15:16.220
but we need to have this discussion

15:16.220 --> 15:18.380
about what kind of life we want.

15:18.380 --> 15:23.020
And to kind of keep the veil over this future society

15:23.020 --> 15:25.780
is not proven to be a successful strategy.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.500
And I think it also is missing the key insight of Noirat,

15:28.500 --> 15:31.300
which is socialism is this collective decision

15:31.300 --> 15:34.260
over our future, and to keep it obscure

15:34.260 --> 15:36.460
is actually quite a neoliberal move.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.420
Like only the market can know something as complex as this.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.620
So again, the book is doing two things,

15:41.620 --> 15:45.740
and we like to think we make a good case

15:45.740 --> 15:47.980
for vegan rewilding,

15:47.980 --> 15:50.580
but we want to have more debates

15:50.580 --> 15:52.500
about what this future should be.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.460
Yeah, democracy is a very big theme in the book,

15:57.300 --> 15:58.860
and it's a major part of,

15:58.860 --> 16:01.500
in the portion of the book that's dealing with planning,

16:01.500 --> 16:03.980
because we kind of take that,

16:03.980 --> 16:05.340
the magnitude of changes required

16:05.340 --> 16:06.820
to do the energy transition alone,

16:06.820 --> 16:09.980
let alone address other parts of the climate crisis

16:09.980 --> 16:13.100
is simply a massive task for planning.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.500
And the question is, how can you plan

16:14.500 --> 16:17.900
in a way that is democratic

16:17.900 --> 16:19.700
and doesn't concentrate power in the hands

16:19.700 --> 16:23.500
of maybe a small bureaucracy or some bureaucracy

16:23.500 --> 16:28.180
that's unaccountable to the rest of humanity?

16:28.180 --> 16:29.740
So we take this problem very seriously,

16:29.740 --> 16:30.580
and I was sort of saying,

16:30.580 --> 16:33.540
we have this idea of these total plans

16:33.540 --> 16:36.340
where you might have a plan that involves

16:36.340 --> 16:37.580
higher use of fossil fuels

16:37.580 --> 16:39.780
with solar geoengineering to cool the climate,

16:39.780 --> 16:42.100
and that would come with huge amounts of risks

16:42.100 --> 16:43.980
and maybe many disasters caused,

16:43.980 --> 16:46.500
but perhaps that would be the one that wins out

16:46.500 --> 16:48.260
in our imagined parliament,

16:48.260 --> 16:51.420
and the intro would just be unhappy in the opposition,

16:51.420 --> 16:54.860
but that's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.980
But the hope would be that we make a clear choice

16:57.980 --> 16:58.900
about what's going on,

16:58.900 --> 17:02.300
because right now we're fumbling blindly into the future.

17:02.300 --> 17:06.020
People aren't aware of the trade-offs of decisions,

17:06.020 --> 17:10.180
like having a massive animal industry

17:10.180 --> 17:12.700
causes huge amounts of land to be used

17:12.700 --> 17:14.700
in a very inefficient way,

17:15.900 --> 17:18.820
burning down the Amazon to make new pastures for cattle.

17:19.820 --> 17:22.900
It's not exactly a great planning choice,

17:22.900 --> 17:27.900
and I think these things are talked about blindly

17:28.500 --> 17:31.740
in an isolation, but when they're combined together

17:31.740 --> 17:33.820
and the trade-offs are more apparent,

17:33.820 --> 17:35.860
that's sort of when democracy can really begin

17:35.860 --> 17:39.340
and when kind of a more sensible,

17:39.340 --> 17:42.980
I don't know, control of the planet can start.

17:42.980 --> 17:45.100
Before we get to the planning part,

17:45.100 --> 17:47.020
and this will be, of course,

17:47.060 --> 17:49.940
a big part of our conversation today,

17:49.940 --> 17:51.420
before we get to the planning part,

17:51.420 --> 17:54.340
maybe you could say some words about your position

17:54.340 --> 17:58.940
towards epistemic groundings of this proposal

17:58.940 --> 18:00.940
in terms of planning,

18:00.940 --> 18:04.060
because I think what is very much relevant

18:04.060 --> 18:07.540
for the whole concept that you propose

18:07.540 --> 18:10.500
and relevant for also a lot of the questions I had

18:10.500 --> 18:12.660
after reading the book is,

18:12.660 --> 18:16.340
what information do you think we need,

18:16.380 --> 18:19.180
and how much can we actually know?

18:19.180 --> 18:20.620
Because in the book,

18:20.620 --> 18:24.700
you make use of certain types of modeling.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.460
You propose that we can use modern modeling technology

18:29.460 --> 18:31.220
in terms of climate modeling.

18:31.220 --> 18:35.340
We could repurpose it for questions of planning,

18:35.340 --> 18:38.340
and also when it comes to the question

18:38.340 --> 18:41.220
whether or not a maybe more decentralized version

18:41.220 --> 18:44.620
of planning would be interesting or a central one,

18:44.620 --> 18:48.020
again, the question of epistemic assumptions

18:48.020 --> 18:51.980
about what knowledge can somebody have

18:51.980 --> 18:54.380
and where can it be located comes up.

18:54.380 --> 18:57.980
So I would be interested in what was the epistemic grounding

18:57.980 --> 19:02.180
when you were thinking about how this planning procedure

19:02.180 --> 19:04.020
could be sketched out.

19:04.020 --> 19:06.460
So one of the foundations for the book

19:06.460 --> 19:10.500
from the very beginning is this dialogue

19:10.500 --> 19:14.140
with the neoliberals, with Hayek and von Mises.

19:14.140 --> 19:17.420
And what the neoliberals use,

19:17.420 --> 19:19.220
and Troy, you can jump in a little bit

19:19.220 --> 19:22.380
and talk more about your favorite baddies,

19:22.380 --> 19:26.260
but what the neoliberals say is basically

19:26.260 --> 19:29.740
that markets are information collecting machines.

19:29.740 --> 19:32.380
They're machines for information

19:32.380 --> 19:37.100
where the price acts as a decentralized signal

19:37.100 --> 19:40.420
that allows everyone to respond in concert to changes,

19:40.420 --> 19:41.860
and they don't need to necessarily know

19:41.860 --> 19:42.780
why the price is that,

19:42.780 --> 19:45.380
but it allows them to make according plans.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.940
And a big part of the idea here

19:50.940 --> 19:54.460
is that human intervention in the market

19:54.460 --> 19:56.020
will always be misguided

19:56.020 --> 19:59.420
because the market is sort of beyond human.

19:59.420 --> 20:03.380
It's a machine that is too complex

20:03.380 --> 20:05.300
and important to mess with,

20:05.300 --> 20:07.380
and therefore we should leave it alone

20:07.380 --> 20:09.660
and let it go about its information business.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.900
And we should add markets in as many places as we can,

20:11.900 --> 20:14.780
even where there aren't markets already.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.780
So it's an epistemic argument.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.420
It's an argument that we can't know about the market.

20:20.580 --> 20:23.260
And interestingly, they use a lot of natural metaphors,

20:23.260 --> 20:26.820
biological metaphors to back up this claim.

20:26.820 --> 20:29.220
So they use biology as a metaphor for the economy

20:30.300 --> 20:33.380
rather than the neoclassical metaphor of physics

20:33.380 --> 20:36.700
to understand making equations, right, to model the economy.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.180
What we point out is that the obvious point

20:39.180 --> 20:41.100
that if you're using nature as a metaphor

20:41.100 --> 20:43.620
for how complex the economy is,

20:43.620 --> 20:46.500
well, surely nature is more complicated than that.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.460
And we talk a lot about how complex nature is

20:48.460 --> 20:52.100
and how it evades attempts of management,

20:52.100 --> 20:53.940
many attempts of management.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.420
We talk about the ozone hole, right,

20:55.420 --> 20:57.740
where the chlorofluorocarbons were used

20:57.740 --> 21:00.020
to replace dangerous refrigerants.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.340
And these were supposed to be completely non-reactive,

21:02.340 --> 21:04.460
like all chemistry up to that point,

21:04.460 --> 21:06.340
we're like, yeah, you know, these are tightly bound.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.940
Nothing's gonna break these molecules apart.

21:08.940 --> 21:10.620
It turns out that in this stratosphere

21:10.620 --> 21:13.100
under certain conditions over Antarctica

21:13.100 --> 21:15.460
and to some extent over the Arctic in the winter

21:15.460 --> 21:16.660
and in the spring, you know,

21:16.660 --> 21:18.540
you can get this breaking apart

21:18.540 --> 21:21.700
and then you can get chlorine radical cycles

21:21.700 --> 21:24.180
just completely eviscerate the ozone layer.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.500
And we just got lucky with this.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.740
We got lucky that it only destroyed

21:26.740 --> 21:27.980
the ozone layer of Antarctica.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.660
If the rate constants were different,

21:29.660 --> 21:31.660
then maybe it would go all over.

21:31.660 --> 21:34.820
So it was just lucky.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.780
This was an intervention

21:35.780 --> 21:39.420
that had all the kind of basis behind it,

21:39.420 --> 21:40.940
all the kind of research behind it.

21:40.940 --> 21:42.620
And so it's just kind of a lesson

21:42.620 --> 21:47.020
that interventions into the environment are risky.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.020
They, it's a very complex place.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.780
We also use the metaphor biosphere two,

21:50.780 --> 21:51.820
which was an attempt to make

21:51.820 --> 21:54.020
an artificial closed ecosystem

21:54.020 --> 21:55.740
with like an artificial coral reef,

21:55.740 --> 21:56.900
a bunch of different biomes,

21:56.900 --> 21:58.140
like in a little dome

21:58.140 --> 22:00.380
and have some humans inside and be supported.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.700
And it completely collapsed rather quickly

22:02.700 --> 22:05.540
because of unintended consequences

22:05.540 --> 22:08.460
like the concrete reacted with the oxygen

22:09.260 --> 22:11.340
and they needed to pump in more oxygen

22:11.340 --> 22:13.020
so people wouldn't die.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.020
Most of the species died

22:14.020 --> 22:16.340
but the invasive cockroaches thrived.

22:16.340 --> 22:17.900
It was a disaster.

22:17.900 --> 22:21.700
And it's a lesson in how complex ecosystem services are.

22:22.620 --> 22:26.020
So we point out that basically the question comes down to,

22:26.020 --> 22:28.380
are you going to plan nature?

22:28.380 --> 22:30.900
Basically, are you going to use geoengineering?

22:30.900 --> 22:33.900
Are you gonna, for example, spray sulfur

22:33.900 --> 22:36.940
into the stratosphere to cool the planet

22:36.980 --> 22:38.620
and make the world safe for markets

22:38.620 --> 22:40.980
to continue to go about their business?

22:40.980 --> 22:43.300
Or are you going to step in

22:43.300 --> 22:46.620
and say that humans must plan our own activities,

22:46.620 --> 22:51.620
the economy and not attempt to plan nature

22:51.860 --> 22:56.780
more than a certain amount described maybe by a vote.

22:56.780 --> 23:00.020
We obviously have to intervene in nature to like grow food

23:00.020 --> 23:03.380
and to supply ourselves with the resources we need.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.620
But we argue that we should set

23:05.620 --> 23:07.300
some conscious limits there

23:07.300 --> 23:10.820
so that we allow nature to have its continued functioning.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.100
I definitely agree with what Drew said

23:14.100 --> 23:18.020
and Drew can speak more about the technical aspects

23:18.020 --> 23:21.460
of how do you relate a global plan

23:21.460 --> 23:25.340
to a series of regional and local plans?

23:25.340 --> 23:28.620
How do you use linear programming

23:28.620 --> 23:30.700
to plan the future as well,

23:30.700 --> 23:33.820
which is one thing Kantorovich worked on.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.740
But what I'm gonna say is relating more

23:36.740 --> 23:41.300
to this neoliberal question of what can be known.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.260
And we can be engaged quite a bit with neoliberals

23:44.260 --> 23:47.620
because we think they really raise an interesting point,

23:47.620 --> 23:52.620
which is economics is where is a question of knowledge.

23:53.740 --> 23:57.300
And we think socialists haven't dealt very well with this

23:57.300 --> 23:59.220
or at some level, a lot of the market socialists

23:59.220 --> 24:02.380
just say Mises was right and Noyrat was wrong.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.500
And therefore, you need markets under socialism.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.020
And we still think Noyrat's critique

24:09.020 --> 24:12.140
of pseudo rationality holds true

24:12.140 --> 24:15.340
where if you have markets based on some kind

24:15.340 --> 24:19.060
of universal metric, this labor time, chits,

24:19.060 --> 24:22.420
or is it energy or what have you,

24:22.420 --> 24:24.420
it would eventually lead to irrational outcomes.

24:24.420 --> 24:27.060
And the only way to rationally manage ourselves

24:27.060 --> 24:29.100
as a species is to recognize

24:29.100 --> 24:32.140
that they're incommensurate units.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.740
And we have to judge the totality,

24:34.740 --> 24:37.740
which is again, what Noyrat argues.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.900
And we're not saying this is gonna be easy.

24:39.900 --> 24:43.380
We're not saying that it's gonna work perfectly.

24:43.380 --> 24:46.260
I mean, we get into Cornyn and this idea

24:46.260 --> 24:49.940
that socialism leads towards shortage often.

24:49.940 --> 24:54.180
And at some level, we're saying we have to make a choice

24:55.940 --> 24:58.660
between do we want restraint and shortage

24:58.740 --> 25:02.900
or do we want excess and disaster

25:02.900 --> 25:05.540
and excesses that we don't want as well.

25:05.540 --> 25:08.580
The other thing I would say is that I think it's true

25:08.580 --> 25:13.580
at some level what socialists and neoliberals point out.

25:14.620 --> 25:16.020
I mean, I think at some level it's true

25:16.020 --> 25:20.940
that it's hard to make up for or compensate

25:20.940 --> 25:23.900
for or replace tacit knowledge

25:23.900 --> 25:26.580
as the person on the ground will have a better view

25:26.580 --> 25:28.580
of things than the planner far away.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.900
That is true, but there is also a value

25:31.900 --> 25:35.260
to having an attempt to see the whole.

25:35.260 --> 25:37.420
And the problems that we're facing now,

25:37.420 --> 25:39.700
I think are better faced with the latter,

25:39.700 --> 25:41.340
with attempts to grasp the whole

25:41.340 --> 25:44.540
than with attempts from a point of view of a single person.

25:44.540 --> 25:48.140
And that's the wager we're making.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.700
That's very interesting.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.380
And we will come back to this

25:51.380 --> 25:54.220
because I have some follow-up questions

25:54.220 --> 25:55.900
regarding exactly that.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.180
But before we do so, I think it would be important

25:58.180 --> 26:02.340
for listeners, for the audience to maybe take a step back

26:02.340 --> 26:07.180
and like cautiously get into the planning stuff

26:07.180 --> 26:10.340
because you argue actually for a synthesis

26:10.340 --> 26:12.140
of different approaches, including,

26:12.140 --> 26:14.700
as you already mentioned, in Natura calculation

26:14.700 --> 26:16.780
as proposed by Otto Neurath.

26:16.780 --> 26:20.740
But you also include Kantorowicz's linear programming,

26:20.740 --> 26:21.940
cybernetics in the form

26:21.940 --> 26:24.940
of Stafford Beer's viable systems model.

26:24.940 --> 26:27.380
What elements from these different approaches

26:27.380 --> 26:30.020
do you think should be incorporated

26:30.020 --> 26:33.740
in contemporary eco-socialist planning?

26:33.740 --> 26:37.860
And how does the resulting planning mechanism

26:37.860 --> 26:39.900
actually look like?

26:39.900 --> 26:43.820
Yeah, so to do a high-level overview,

26:43.820 --> 26:46.540
the basic idea is to have,

26:46.540 --> 26:48.100
we kind of imagined sort of roughly

26:48.100 --> 26:51.620
that you would have some set of total plans,

26:51.620 --> 26:54.340
so visions that are coherent for the future

26:54.380 --> 26:57.660
that are then made available for a vote

26:57.660 --> 27:01.020
and then are produced in turn also with lots of input

27:01.020 --> 27:05.060
from people and various interests.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.420
And so how you would devise these sort of,

27:07.420 --> 27:09.820
you would call them maybe blueprints for the future.

27:09.820 --> 27:12.180
And you might use many different methodologies

27:12.180 --> 27:13.780
to produce such a blueprint.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.500
One important historical algorithm

27:16.500 --> 27:19.540
that is still very important today is linear programming,

27:19.540 --> 27:22.060
which is a way of doing constrained optimization.

27:22.060 --> 27:25.100
So if you have a set of constraints that you propose,

27:25.100 --> 27:28.780
like we have only this many people working this many hours

27:28.780 --> 27:30.220
and we need to produce these goods,

27:30.220 --> 27:31.820
what's an optimal solution

27:31.820 --> 27:33.460
or an optimal way of distributing this work?

27:33.460 --> 27:35.820
And this is used all the time in corporate planning.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.780
This is used all the time

27:36.780 --> 27:39.100
in designing renewable energy systems.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.820
It's a very commonly used algorithm,

27:40.820 --> 27:42.500
but there are of course many other ways,

27:42.500 --> 27:44.340
many other tools that one can use.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.180
The idea is to make like kind of a rough draft,

27:46.180 --> 27:48.500
no need to go into super deep detail

27:48.500 --> 27:49.860
and it's not even probably possible,

27:49.860 --> 27:51.940
but to give people an idea of like, okay,

27:52.820 --> 27:54.300
if we have a high energy use future,

27:54.300 --> 27:56.580
this is the sort of resources we'll need.

27:56.580 --> 27:58.780
This is the amount of maybe mining labor,

27:58.780 --> 28:01.660
this is the amount of XYZ

28:01.660 --> 28:04.220
and these are the natural risks,

28:04.220 --> 28:06.140
the risks of climate change,

28:06.140 --> 28:08.140
the risks of geoengineering,

28:08.140 --> 28:11.220
the risks of XYZ involved in this plan.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.300
And then you might have another plan

28:12.300 --> 28:14.340
that's more in line with what me and Troy are proposing.

28:14.340 --> 28:17.380
So you give up a meat

28:17.380 --> 28:20.780
and maybe there could be variations of how much meat

28:20.780 --> 28:22.500
and animal products are given up.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.900
And then you can talk about the benefits

28:25.900 --> 28:28.340
and the sacrifices involved.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.460
And then hopefully you come to a vote

28:30.460 --> 28:33.420
and you come up with a particular path forward.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.340
And then from there,

28:34.340 --> 28:36.460
you have to go to day-to-day management.

28:36.460 --> 28:39.300
And this is where we draw on more of the Stafford beer.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.700
Yes, Troy.

28:40.700 --> 28:41.940
I just wanted to point out

28:41.940 --> 28:44.980
that Drew has already made a model,

28:44.980 --> 28:47.060
a very basic linear programming model

28:47.060 --> 28:49.140
with these constraints between energy use

28:49.180 --> 28:51.500
and land use and extinction rate and all that.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.540
And we use that in the book and we say,

28:53.540 --> 28:56.260
okay, well, what if we want this quota for energy

28:56.260 --> 28:58.380
or what if we want to protect this much land?

28:58.380 --> 29:00.660
And then we test the constraints

29:00.660 --> 29:02.620
and see if that plan is viable.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.820
And again, this is a very basic model

29:04.820 --> 29:05.980
but it's already more complex

29:05.980 --> 29:09.140
than Nordhaus' DICE model, right?

29:09.140 --> 29:12.100
And this is not hard to do,

29:12.100 --> 29:16.340
to have like a very basic discussion about what's possible.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.460
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

29:19.460 --> 29:22.020
Very basic model, but the idea is basically being like,

29:22.020 --> 29:24.820
okay, if you assume a certain amount of electrification,

29:24.820 --> 29:27.540
how much, what would your energy mix look like?

29:27.540 --> 29:28.660
That sort of thing.

29:28.660 --> 29:32.860
But from there, you have to go to day-to-day management.

29:32.860 --> 29:36.900
So we talk a little bit about the Cybersyn experiment

29:36.900 --> 29:39.860
in Salvador Allende's democratic socialist experiment

29:39.860 --> 29:43.380
in Chile in the early 1970s.

29:43.380 --> 29:46.820
And the idea here was that the Allende government

29:46.820 --> 29:50.780
was bringing in industries into the state controlled sector

29:50.780 --> 29:54.340
and they needed to basically organize and plan

29:54.340 --> 29:57.220
this rapidly growing sector of the economy.

29:57.220 --> 30:00.620
And so some Chilean engineers brought in Stafford Beer

30:00.620 --> 30:04.780
who was a British cybernetics person.

30:04.780 --> 30:08.660
And Beer had this model that he had been working on,

30:08.660 --> 30:11.540
this kind of management model that was hoping

30:12.420 --> 30:13.740
to your earlier point,

30:13.740 --> 30:16.940
try and balance the appropriate amount of centralization

30:16.940 --> 30:20.900
to make sure that resources are being allocated sensibly

30:20.900 --> 30:22.820
with enough decentralization

30:22.820 --> 30:25.260
to prevent any irrational outcomes

30:25.260 --> 30:28.460
or violations of the democratic socialist principles

30:28.460 --> 30:31.860
that Allende's revolution was built on top of.

30:31.860 --> 30:35.340
So both kind of making use of sort of tacit knowledge

30:35.340 --> 30:37.420
of closer to a particular circumstance

30:37.420 --> 30:41.620
and also preventing any unjust

30:41.620 --> 30:44.060
or undenocratic bureaucracy from emerging.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.380
And it's a lot of detail to get into,

30:47.380 --> 30:50.340
but the basic idea of the viable systems model is there's,

30:50.340 --> 30:53.620
you can kind of let say a factory manage itself

30:53.620 --> 30:58.460
most of the time, kind of letting higher authorities know

30:58.460 --> 31:00.060
its inputs and outputs.

31:00.060 --> 31:02.500
Although Stafford Beer would hate me saying higher authority.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.380
He considered this whole thing level,

31:05.380 --> 31:10.380
but like letting a more central information managers

31:10.380 --> 31:11.700
knowing inputs and outputs,

31:11.700 --> 31:14.100
and then emergent skills could be bumped up

31:14.100 --> 31:16.980
to higher levels of coordination.

31:16.980 --> 31:19.020
And again, Stafford Beer would hate me saying higher,

31:19.020 --> 31:24.020
but this proves its metal in a CIA backed strike

31:24.340 --> 31:27.940
against the logistic sector, against the trucking sector.

31:27.940 --> 31:32.940
So basically the entire transport of materials breaks down

31:32.940 --> 31:36.700
in Chile and they had some loyal trucks left.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.140
And the question was, how can we make sure everyone gets food

31:39.140 --> 31:41.020
and how can we make sure that the economy

31:41.020 --> 31:42.380
continues to function?

31:42.380 --> 31:46.220
And this sort of system allowed basically people

31:46.220 --> 31:48.940
on the ground to kind of almost in dialogue

31:48.940 --> 31:52.460
with the center, direct resources in the most wise way.

31:52.460 --> 31:55.020
So like mapping out where this truck should be driving.

31:55.020 --> 31:59.740
So it was this very remarkable evenness

31:59.740 --> 32:03.220
between kind of people out in the field

32:03.220 --> 32:06.620
and people in the center where all this information

32:06.620 --> 32:08.540
was kind of coming in and being distributed,

32:08.540 --> 32:12.660
where these scarce resources are being allocated reasonably

32:12.660 --> 32:13.940
and the country was able to make it

32:13.940 --> 32:17.060
through the strike successfully.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.660
So it's a really interesting kind of management experiment

32:20.660 --> 32:21.900
that did use technology,

32:21.900 --> 32:25.260
but not as much as I think it has a reputation for.

32:25.260 --> 32:27.780
These were like primitive fax machines, right?

32:27.780 --> 32:28.980
That was required.

32:28.980 --> 32:32.580
The computer itself was important, but not hugely.

32:32.580 --> 32:36.100
And then we bring in some more modern ways

32:36.100 --> 32:39.300
of fusing information with modeling from climate science.

32:39.300 --> 32:42.500
So climate science and weather are,

32:42.500 --> 32:44.780
I think something that we should be talking about

32:44.780 --> 32:47.380
because what the weather system is,

32:47.380 --> 32:49.540
what the weather kind of prediction system is,

32:49.540 --> 32:52.060
is a truly global system of information.

32:52.060 --> 32:55.260
So we have weather models, which are models of physics,

32:56.220 --> 32:58.340
but the weather system is chaotic.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.260
People have heard of the butterfly effect, right?

33:00.260 --> 33:01.380
Butterfly flaps and swings,

33:01.380 --> 33:03.900
and then all of a sudden there's a hurricane.

33:03.900 --> 33:06.260
And the basic idea is that if you have slight changes

33:06.260 --> 33:07.460
in your initial conditions,

33:07.460 --> 33:10.180
days later you have a totally different weather system.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.740
It's a chaotic system.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.340
So you need your initial conditions

33:13.340 --> 33:15.180
to be as close to accurate as you can

33:15.180 --> 33:16.980
so that your forecast is accurate.

33:16.980 --> 33:18.700
And the reason why weather forecasts have improved

33:18.700 --> 33:20.460
is because we have better initial conditions.

33:20.460 --> 33:21.620
We have better initial conditions

33:21.620 --> 33:24.820
because we have a global network of sensors, monitors,

33:24.980 --> 33:25.900
and information.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.060
We have satellites, we have buoys in the ocean,

33:28.060 --> 33:30.580
we have ships, we have aircraft,

33:30.580 --> 33:33.540
we have monitors on the surface.

33:33.540 --> 33:36.180
In fact, during the COVID pandemic,

33:36.180 --> 33:37.620
weather forecast got slightly worse

33:37.620 --> 33:39.180
because you didn't have as many planes flying

33:39.180 --> 33:41.260
and you didn't have that kind of mid-atmosphere input

33:41.260 --> 33:42.700
into your weather model.

33:42.700 --> 33:44.900
It's a truly global information system.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.340
And the algorithms designed to run this system

33:48.340 --> 33:50.020
views the sort of model of like

33:50.020 --> 33:52.180
what you think should be going on with what's in the world.

33:52.180 --> 33:53.900
And if there's divergence between what the model says

33:53.900 --> 33:54.740
and what the world says,

33:54.740 --> 33:56.940
there are optimal ways to combine those.

33:56.940 --> 33:59.620
So if you have a plan for how the economy should work,

33:59.620 --> 34:02.420
that plan will obviously fail because, you know,

34:02.420 --> 34:04.940
things will not work out the way you assumed,

34:04.940 --> 34:06.900
but it should be relatively accurate

34:06.900 --> 34:08.900
because it is what the plan is.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.140
And so you can update that plan on the basis of, say,

34:12.140 --> 34:15.420
like a factory not receiving its steel shipments,

34:15.420 --> 34:17.780
and you could maybe go in and see where the problem is

34:17.780 --> 34:20.300
and be able to intervene in a way that's sensible,

34:20.300 --> 34:22.780
but that also makes sure that autonomy is preserved

34:22.780 --> 34:25.340
to as great of an extent as necessary,

34:25.340 --> 34:27.660
but also make sure that everyone's working towards

34:27.660 --> 34:30.220
common, coherent goals.

34:30.220 --> 34:32.460
So it's a balancing approach.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.060
And these are really remarkable algorithms.

34:34.060 --> 34:36.540
I think there needs to be more conversation about them.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.980
They're very powerful tools that are already being used

34:38.980 --> 34:42.660
to do a form of global information management.

34:43.660 --> 34:45.420
And I'm very sorry, Drew,

34:45.420 --> 34:48.780
but I have to pick up on the question of higher authority

34:49.660 --> 34:51.260
because you rightly point out

34:51.260 --> 34:54.340
that I would be skeptical of this phrase,

34:54.340 --> 34:58.980
but when I read specifically the narrative part

34:58.980 --> 35:00.580
at the end of the book,

35:00.580 --> 35:05.580
there is a sense of quote unquote higher authority

35:05.980 --> 35:10.980
in terms of the like central planning board.

35:10.980 --> 35:14.180
And as far as I understood it, at the end,

35:14.180 --> 35:19.180
the model that you propose will end up in kind of calculating

35:20.100 --> 35:23.500
optimal plan or the best variety of plans

35:23.500 --> 35:26.780
that all try to be as efficient as possible

35:26.780 --> 35:31.780
and then propose these plans to the public to decide over,

35:32.180 --> 35:34.700
but then you will always come into the situation

35:34.700 --> 35:37.860
where people will have to enact this plan.

35:37.860 --> 35:40.380
And this might lead to a situation

35:40.380 --> 35:42.940
where those people who will have to enact the plan

35:42.940 --> 35:46.020
will perceive this plan as external from themselves,

35:46.020 --> 35:47.980
depending on how much they were involved

35:47.980 --> 35:49.900
in creating the plan, of course,

35:49.900 --> 35:52.380
but still, at least for me,

35:52.380 --> 35:55.700
when reading the narrative part at the end of the book,

35:55.700 --> 35:58.740
there was a certain sense of this

35:58.740 --> 36:02.140
like detached planning commission,

36:02.140 --> 36:05.860
which seemed to be a bunch of experts, quote unquote,

36:05.860 --> 36:08.340
that calculates this optimal plan

36:08.340 --> 36:13.340
that we are now forced to bring into being into practice.

36:13.980 --> 36:18.980
So there is this element of higher authority coupled to,

36:20.420 --> 36:24.300
I would say the concept of central planning per se.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.460
And I would be interested

36:25.460 --> 36:29.380
how you conceptualize this in your model.

36:29.380 --> 36:32.620
I got the feeling as if your main point would be,

36:32.620 --> 36:36.420
it's urgent, we need to fucking do something.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.860
This is the only way we can do it.

36:39.380 --> 36:43.460
That's the kind of vibe I got more or less,

36:43.460 --> 36:45.180
I have to be honest.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.300
I mean, I'll start,

36:47.300 --> 36:50.740
Drew is definitely the more the mathematical whiz

36:50.740 --> 36:52.020
of the two of us by far.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.660
But I think I just want to point out that,

36:57.060 --> 36:59.220
what's nice about linear programming

36:59.220 --> 37:03.420
is that the math, as Drew's saying, is not so complex.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.940
So I think we imagine at some level

37:04.940 --> 37:08.700
that everyone would be taking linear programming

37:09.540 --> 37:11.540
in school and anyone could make a global plan

37:11.540 --> 37:13.780
or anyone can use the modeling tools

37:13.780 --> 37:16.500
that one puts out to make a plan

37:16.500 --> 37:17.740
and one could make their own plans.

37:17.740 --> 37:22.500
And this is the very Noiratian approach to socialism

37:22.500 --> 37:24.540
where you are showing the working class

37:24.540 --> 37:27.420
what the economy is, let them see it through isotype,

37:27.420 --> 37:32.020
make it as visually easy to understand

37:32.020 --> 37:33.700
and appealing as possible.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.140
And they'll set up museums

37:35.140 --> 37:37.220
and get hundreds of thousands of people

37:37.220 --> 37:39.660
to see what the Austrian economy looks like.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.460
And then you can imagine taking it over.

37:41.460 --> 37:44.180
And I think with this kind of mathematics,

37:44.180 --> 37:47.940
people would see a relation between their own work

37:47.940 --> 37:51.180
and what kind of world they want.

37:51.180 --> 37:53.740
And I think this is an important part

37:53.740 --> 37:56.060
of what socialist democracy would be.

37:56.060 --> 37:58.380
And that's not to say that people are always gonna get

37:58.380 --> 38:00.900
the plans that they vote for,

38:00.900 --> 38:03.180
but that they want, right?

38:03.180 --> 38:06.420
But I think it would be one important way

38:06.420 --> 38:10.300
to overcome maybe any kind of reluctance or disagreement.

38:10.300 --> 38:14.300
I mean, again, humans are always gonna disagree.

38:14.300 --> 38:16.460
I don't think that's going to go away,

38:16.460 --> 38:20.060
but there's also a reason why it's important for us

38:20.060 --> 38:23.100
to have a more nuanced relationship

38:23.100 --> 38:26.020
between local and central planning.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.860
And I think a lot of debates on the left

38:28.860 --> 38:31.020
are just like, oh, we'll just have a tiny little communes

38:31.020 --> 38:32.820
that are extremely inefficient,

38:33.980 --> 38:36.020
but they'll be autonomous and that'll be fine.

38:36.620 --> 38:38.980
Or we'll have some gigantic tanky solution,

38:38.980 --> 38:40.140
like a super plan.

38:40.140 --> 38:44.020
And I think what Kantorovich and Bjerg get into

38:44.020 --> 38:45.900
is a much more nimble relationship.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.900
It's important to have some things centralized

38:49.900 --> 38:52.900
where you can, I guess, not efficient for everyone to make,

38:52.900 --> 38:55.820
I don't know, their own high grade aluminum

38:55.820 --> 38:56.860
or something like that.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.460
It's better to do in some areas than others.

38:59.460 --> 39:02.780
But we also want to,

39:02.780 --> 39:04.660
we also will have problems with information.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.980
That's why you will have a central plan

39:06.980 --> 39:08.660
that is relatively vague,

39:08.660 --> 39:12.100
and then you get down to finer detail the lower you go.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.340
But of course, if a planning bureau

39:16.340 --> 39:20.020
or the parliament that we imagine that we put in La Paz

39:20.020 --> 39:23.300
votes to have mandatory veganism or something like that,

39:23.300 --> 39:25.900
well, I'm sure lots of people won't like that,

39:25.900 --> 39:28.100
no matter how strong the animal rights movement

39:28.100 --> 39:32.020
has become by 2040 or whatever it is.

39:32.020 --> 39:33.340
I mean, there still would be opposition,

39:33.380 --> 39:35.700
but I think that's just what politics is.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.260
And socialism would be at some level

39:37.260 --> 39:39.700
of the politicization of everything

39:39.700 --> 39:42.420
because that is what democratic control of the economy is.

39:42.420 --> 39:43.780
I don't think we should be afraid of that.

39:43.780 --> 39:46.660
And that's where I think market socialists

39:46.660 --> 39:48.020
escape back to the market.

39:48.020 --> 39:51.420
I think they come close to seeing what socialism looks like,

39:51.420 --> 39:55.340
which is what Neuert tells us in 1919,

39:55.340 --> 39:58.300
and then they withdraw because it's too terrifying,

39:58.300 --> 39:59.500
it's too much conflict.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.700
But I think this is a mistake.

40:03.540 --> 40:08.140
Yeah, I think the environmental crisis

40:08.140 --> 40:11.860
throws a wrench into a lot of things.

40:11.860 --> 40:15.140
And I think it's just important to remember

40:15.140 --> 40:19.580
how challenging the questions facing us are.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.660
Like they're more challenging,

40:21.660 --> 40:22.780
as we talked about earlier,

40:22.780 --> 40:26.260
than the IPCC 1.5 degree report that's on

40:26.260 --> 40:29.460
because that report assumes so much facts.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.500
For example, this is an extremely hard problem,

40:32.500 --> 40:37.500
making sure that the dream of socialism that I have

40:37.700 --> 40:40.820
is that everyone on the earth has the resources

40:40.820 --> 40:45.820
for a good life, there's equality,

40:45.820 --> 40:47.780
everyone has the things they need,

40:47.780 --> 40:50.620
and we have a planet that's able to sustain this.

40:51.460 --> 40:53.460
That's a hard goal.

40:53.460 --> 40:57.420
And it's a goal that requires coordination.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.740
And we do try really hard in the book to make sure,

41:00.740 --> 41:03.220
to emphasize how if this is not democratic,

41:03.220 --> 41:04.780
it will fail, right?

41:04.780 --> 41:09.060
There's no way that we imagine this working,

41:09.060 --> 41:12.380
that the democracy is not just like a value,

41:12.380 --> 41:13.780
it's just like a functioning.

41:13.780 --> 41:15.700
Like if you're going to basically get rid

41:15.700 --> 41:16.820
of the capitalist engine,

41:16.820 --> 41:19.340
which is saying that if you don't work, you'll starve.

41:19.340 --> 41:20.980
If you're getting rid of that,

41:20.980 --> 41:25.980
then you're going to have to have buy-in,

41:26.140 --> 41:28.900
and democracy is how you get buy-in.

41:28.900 --> 41:33.900
So it has to be democratic to work.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.020
I don't know if this is convincing to you.

41:36.020 --> 41:36.860
Yeah.

41:36.860 --> 41:38.420
No, no, but I would say your democracy part

41:38.420 --> 41:41.060
is also important because Kantorovich comes up

41:41.060 --> 41:43.860
with linear programming in the 30s,

41:43.860 --> 41:46.460
and he talks to God's plan in the 40s,

41:46.460 --> 41:48.460
and it doesn't go anywhere because God's plan

41:48.460 --> 41:50.420
gets all its power from,

41:50.420 --> 41:54.020
and let alone all the ministries and the government,

41:54.020 --> 41:57.060
get their power from powers of distribution.

41:57.060 --> 42:00.740
And if you had people voting on a plan,

42:00.740 --> 42:02.140
and then people carrying out the plan,

42:02.140 --> 42:05.420
that would take away this power from these ministries

42:05.420 --> 42:06.660
or planning bureaus.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.620
So therefore you needed democracy

42:09.620 --> 42:11.220
to actually have linear programming.

42:11.220 --> 42:14.660
That's why the Soviet Union never did it at scale,

42:14.660 --> 42:16.460
because it would undo the power

42:16.460 --> 42:18.100
of this authoritarian regime.

42:19.700 --> 42:23.020
Well, but the way that the plans would come about

42:23.020 --> 42:25.540
in your proposed scheme of things

42:25.540 --> 42:28.860
is not through mere linear programming,

42:28.860 --> 42:31.100
as you rightly state in the book.

42:31.100 --> 42:36.100
This is maybe a tool for certain types of questions.

42:38.900 --> 42:40.420
It might be useful,

42:40.420 --> 42:45.420
but it is not that people could use linear programming

42:45.660 --> 42:49.620
at home to make a plan on their own,

42:49.620 --> 42:52.940
because the plans that the central planning board,

42:52.940 --> 42:54.980
quote unquote, would produce

42:54.980 --> 42:59.220
would have so much more components included in them,

42:59.220 --> 43:03.620
from like high level modeling

43:03.620 --> 43:08.620
that was repurposed from climate modeling,

43:09.020 --> 43:12.740
to like data from, I guess,

43:12.740 --> 43:15.620
billions and billions of sensors throughout the world,

43:15.620 --> 43:17.380
and so on and so forth.

43:17.380 --> 43:19.540
So it is not that people could,

43:19.540 --> 43:22.220
through this playful participation,

43:22.220 --> 43:27.220
really take part in this planning in a meaningful way.

43:27.940 --> 43:30.260
So my question would be,

43:30.260 --> 43:35.260
how is this interrelationship between central and decentral

43:36.420 --> 43:40.260
really working out in concrete terms

43:40.260 --> 43:42.100
when it comes to A,

43:42.100 --> 43:44.420
the question of how these plans come about,

43:44.420 --> 43:49.420
and B, how people are rightfully so perceiving it

43:50.380 --> 43:55.380
as a democratic act of participation within this process?

43:56.580 --> 43:59.860
So we finished this book a year ago, right?

43:59.860 --> 44:02.180
Maybe even a little more.

44:02.180 --> 44:05.020
But we've kept thinking about these issues

44:05.020 --> 44:08.980
because you're pushing on the right pressure points here.

44:08.980 --> 44:13.420
So we've been thinking about some other literatures

44:13.420 --> 44:17.780
and thinking about some older papers and ideas

44:17.780 --> 44:21.260
that revolve around this idea of iterative planning

44:21.260 --> 44:22.900
or multi-level planning.

44:22.900 --> 44:27.900
And the idea here is that you would have some rough draft

44:28.420 --> 44:30.660
from the middle that might say something

44:30.660 --> 44:33.460
like some rough estimates.

44:33.460 --> 44:36.220
Then you kind of give that out to stakeholders.

44:36.220 --> 44:38.340
And in the original papers,

44:38.340 --> 44:41.380
this is not overly concerned with democracy,

44:41.380 --> 44:43.020
but we would want it to be democratic.

44:43.020 --> 44:43.940
So you give it to stakeholders,

44:43.940 --> 44:45.740
you'd be like, okay, to this factory,

44:45.740 --> 44:50.020
do you think this is a reasonable like kind of downscaling

44:50.020 --> 44:51.460
what the implications of this plan would be?

44:51.460 --> 44:52.700
Do you think this is reasonable?

44:52.700 --> 44:55.220
Do you need more of X or more of Y?

44:55.220 --> 44:57.660
Is this just way too much work?

44:57.660 --> 45:00.500
Is this too much food to expect from this piece of land

45:00.500 --> 45:04.460
given X amount of pesticides are going to be used

45:04.460 --> 45:06.060
or not used, that sort of thing.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.900
And then is this going to cause harm

45:08.900 --> 45:12.420
to this environmental region or these practices here?

45:12.420 --> 45:15.220
And then you get the feedback and then use that to refine

45:16.020 --> 45:18.740
and then maybe you cohere the feedback in some way.

45:18.740 --> 45:22.820
So try and make coherent these things

45:22.820 --> 45:26.340
and produce a new kind of rough idea of the future.

45:26.340 --> 45:28.500
You propagate back down, get more feedback.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.860
And hopefully after a few cycles of this,

45:30.860 --> 45:32.540
of these sets of inputs,

45:32.540 --> 45:35.940
you would have a set of coherent plans

45:35.940 --> 45:39.140
that are plausible at a local level.

45:39.140 --> 45:41.660
And then of course, when the plans are enacted,

45:41.660 --> 45:43.100
you would have of course,

45:43.140 --> 45:46.100
wide leeway on a local level on how to enact them.

45:46.100 --> 45:48.300
It would be that the sort of central goals

45:48.300 --> 45:49.300
are much more about,

45:49.300 --> 45:50.940
are we going to cross planetary boundaries

45:50.940 --> 45:51.900
and are we going to make sure

45:51.900 --> 45:53.980
that everyone gets the raw amount of energy

45:53.980 --> 45:55.980
or food that they need for a good life?

45:55.980 --> 45:57.500
Is there going to be enough grain production?

45:57.500 --> 45:58.940
Is there going to be enough energy production

45:58.940 --> 45:59.780
in the right ways?

45:59.780 --> 46:00.980
Are our grids stable?

46:02.740 --> 46:07.660
Is the key ecosystems being managed well

46:07.660 --> 46:09.260
by whoever's managing them?

46:10.620 --> 46:12.260
That sort of rough idea of things.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.460
Then when the plan is enacted,

46:14.460 --> 46:16.260
you would have a more local manager.

46:16.260 --> 46:19.020
So that's how we've come to imagine

46:19.020 --> 46:21.580
from more engagement with these questions,

46:21.580 --> 46:23.020
how you might produce these plans

46:23.020 --> 46:25.220
in a way that has more democratic input.

46:25.220 --> 46:26.540
And there've been some experiments

46:26.540 --> 46:29.460
with participatory planning out there.

46:29.460 --> 46:34.140
They're often very short-lived or partial.

46:34.140 --> 46:37.020
I think there's a way to make it work

46:37.020 --> 46:41.940
that's necessary both for the construction of the plan,

46:42.620 --> 46:45.140
a fair bit of information and input,

46:45.140 --> 46:47.340
but also in making sure that there's democratic.

46:47.340 --> 46:48.980
There was an experiment in Kerala, India

46:48.980 --> 46:52.540
in the 1997 to 2002 five-year plan,

46:52.540 --> 46:54.780
which was basically an attempt to

46:54.780 --> 46:56.860
have these participatory planning meetings

46:56.860 --> 46:59.860
and hundreds of thousands of people got involved.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.460
The idea was to have this input go into the plan.

47:02.460 --> 47:04.340
The problem was that there wasn't,

47:04.340 --> 47:07.060
this sort of iterative process didn't happen.

47:07.060 --> 47:09.740
So you had a lot of great ideas

47:09.780 --> 47:14.260
that didn't quite get adhered into something cool.

47:14.260 --> 47:15.940
So there were some cool things about like pollination.

47:15.940 --> 47:17.820
Like some people knew about how pollination worked

47:17.820 --> 47:20.220
in their fields and they were able to get that incorporated.

47:20.220 --> 47:24.420
But it was more like tweaks rather than like a dialogue,

47:24.420 --> 47:27.380
which is what we would imagine being an ideal.

47:27.380 --> 47:29.620
So this is an inspiring experiment.

47:29.620 --> 47:32.300
But I mean, obviously you're pointing out

47:32.300 --> 47:33.860
this is a challenging problem, right?

47:33.860 --> 47:37.420
Like we don't feel this job, but like, yeah.

47:37.420 --> 47:39.700
True, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

47:39.700 --> 47:42.060
but I think the idea is you would have these

47:42.060 --> 47:45.940
linear programming models as a rough draft

47:45.940 --> 47:48.980
that people could examine and vote on and all that.

47:48.980 --> 47:53.300
And also the linear programming models would relate

47:53.300 --> 47:56.500
from like a central, like a global plan

47:56.500 --> 47:58.860
down to a regional and local plan in various ways.

47:58.860 --> 48:00.140
For example, if you vote globally,

48:00.140 --> 48:01.780
okay, everyone gets 2,000 Watts

48:01.780 --> 48:04.380
and they have 2,500 calories.

48:04.380 --> 48:05.660
And then like the region will say,

48:05.700 --> 48:08.220
okay, where are we going to get this energy from?

48:08.220 --> 48:10.700
And then make another plan and say, okay,

48:10.700 --> 48:13.180
it's more efficient getting it from solar versus wind

48:13.180 --> 48:14.340
and we'll put things here and there.

48:14.340 --> 48:17.340
And then you have that kind of relationship

48:17.340 --> 48:21.020
of being specific more and more

48:21.020 --> 48:22.220
as you go down to the local,

48:22.220 --> 48:26.100
but with parameters set by this larger model.

48:26.100 --> 48:29.500
But it's not like you just vote once on a plan

48:29.500 --> 48:31.860
and then you have the data assimilation,

48:31.860 --> 48:34.660
the cybernetics kind of run the plan for infinity.

48:34.820 --> 48:38.940
The way we're imagining is you would have a series of plan,

48:38.940 --> 48:42.100
maybe like a five-year plan or whatever timeline you want.

48:42.100 --> 48:44.500
And then people can say, go to parliament and say,

48:44.500 --> 48:45.620
okay, what are we going to do

48:45.620 --> 48:47.700
in the next five or 10 or 20 years?

48:47.700 --> 48:49.860
What are our plans for that?

48:49.860 --> 48:51.380
And that can be voted on.

48:51.380 --> 48:55.620
So I think the linear programming is a guide

48:55.620 --> 48:59.340
and the cybernetics is how you implement these things.

48:59.340 --> 49:02.820
But I don't think it's once you've allowed cybernetics

49:02.820 --> 49:04.300
to suddenly becomes undemocratic.

49:04.740 --> 49:06.020
It's just a tool.

49:06.980 --> 49:10.620
Well, I'm so sorry, but I have to disagree.

49:10.620 --> 49:11.460
Please, please.

49:11.460 --> 49:12.780
It's not just a tool.

49:12.780 --> 49:14.300
Yeah, I'm very sorry.

49:14.300 --> 49:19.300
Because I mean, I think at least two points within the book

49:19.580 --> 49:24.180
where this idea of just being a tool comes up

49:24.180 --> 49:26.940
with regard to linear programming.

49:26.940 --> 49:29.740
And now Troy, you just mentioned it

49:29.740 --> 49:33.780
with regard to cybernetics, but it is not just a tool.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.140
Let's take the case of cybernetics.

49:37.140 --> 49:40.860
It is founded on a functional equalization

49:40.860 --> 49:44.220
of humans and machines as information processing systems.

49:44.220 --> 49:48.420
And by looking at the situation from such a perspective,

49:48.420 --> 49:52.180
one will find very different solutions to problems

49:52.180 --> 49:55.300
compared to someone who looks at the problem

49:55.300 --> 49:58.340
informed by a different paradigm, so to speak.

49:58.340 --> 50:03.340
So these are not neutral tools or neutral theories,

50:03.500 --> 50:07.860
but they incorporate a certain perspective on things

50:07.860 --> 50:12.580
and that carries along certain assumptions

50:12.580 --> 50:16.100
about the things that are addressed within the models,

50:16.100 --> 50:17.060
so to speak.

50:18.100 --> 50:20.660
And I mean, at least as I understood it

50:20.660 --> 50:23.300
in the case of linear programming,

50:23.300 --> 50:26.700
the way that you build up your idea

50:26.700 --> 50:31.420
of synthesizing different approaches towards planning,

50:31.420 --> 50:34.020
as far as I read it, it more or less said,

50:34.020 --> 50:36.660
all right, we have this idea of linear programming.

50:36.660 --> 50:41.260
We have this as a mode of approaching certain problems

50:41.260 --> 50:43.020
where it might be adequate,

50:43.020 --> 50:48.020
but you cannot adapt to constant changes very well.

50:48.460 --> 50:53.460
And because of that, trying to approach planning

50:54.060 --> 50:57.180
merely through the perspective of linear programming

50:57.180 --> 50:59.220
is insufficient, and I would totally agree.

50:59.380 --> 51:02.060
And because of that, you go on to take a look

51:02.060 --> 51:05.540
at different other approaches, one of them being cybernetics.

51:05.540 --> 51:10.220
But that does also mean that what you just tried

51:10.220 --> 51:14.220
to describe, Troy, that we would all be kind of able

51:14.220 --> 51:19.220
to understand or maybe even reproduce this process

51:20.700 --> 51:24.660
would not be possible, because as I said before,

51:24.660 --> 51:27.420
linear program is just one piece

51:27.460 --> 51:32.260
within a very complex system of producing different plans

51:32.260 --> 51:35.740
that will then be decided upon.

51:38.460 --> 51:40.300
I'm not sure where this is leading me

51:40.300 --> 51:42.540
because it's not really a question,

51:42.540 --> 51:47.060
and I stated this before, it's just that I think for me,

51:47.060 --> 51:51.460
it was a bit difficult to get to grips

51:51.460 --> 51:54.620
with this directionality

51:54.620 --> 51:59.620
and this emphasis on a center that has at the end

52:01.620 --> 52:06.620
the knowledge that is needed in order to compute these plans,

52:07.220 --> 52:08.820
and because there are so many problems

52:08.820 --> 52:12.620
that go along with this, because it is also not innocent

52:12.620 --> 52:16.980
to have five or 10 or 50 or 100 plans,

52:16.980 --> 52:21.700
because by choosing, by pre-selecting the different plans,

52:21.700 --> 52:25.740
you already enact such a huge power,

52:25.740 --> 52:29.180
because you kind of present the field

52:29.180 --> 52:32.260
upon which the further game will be played,

52:32.260 --> 52:35.060
and this is such an immense power,

52:35.060 --> 52:40.060
and it is not that these are merely neutral technocrats

52:40.300 --> 52:45.300
that are just kind of doing this for the sake of humanity,

52:46.420 --> 52:49.500
even if they do, it would be problematic

52:49.500 --> 52:54.500
on epistemic grounds and on grounds of question of power

52:54.820 --> 52:56.100
and stuff like that.

52:56.100 --> 53:00.100
So I think I was kind of arguing with myself

53:02.660 --> 53:07.660
with this type of constellation between the individuals

53:08.460 --> 53:12.940
and the center, and then, of course, the question comes up,

53:12.940 --> 53:15.380
how do you get people to do this?

53:15.380 --> 53:20.380
If you have this plan, how do you get them to enact it?

53:20.700 --> 53:22.900
So if there are no monetary incentives,

53:22.900 --> 53:26.100
which I absolutely loved about the model,

53:26.100 --> 53:29.340
you do not want to force people into doing anything,

53:29.340 --> 53:33.260
and you want to give them a very high level

53:33.260 --> 53:34.660
of existential security,

53:34.660 --> 53:36.660
which I absolutely loved about the model,

53:36.660 --> 53:39.780
and this is absolutely right, the way you approach it,

53:39.780 --> 53:43.980
but there are so many questions that come up after,

53:43.980 --> 53:47.340
came up for me after reading this constellation,

53:47.340 --> 53:52.340
which for me, at least, kind of tended a bit too much

53:52.660 --> 53:55.660
in the direction of central planning,

53:55.660 --> 53:58.740
because I'm absolutely convinced as you are

53:58.740 --> 54:00.380
that both is needed.

54:00.380 --> 54:02.060
We do need central elements,

54:02.060 --> 54:04.460
we do need decentral elements,

54:04.460 --> 54:09.260
but from my kind of understanding,

54:09.260 --> 54:12.580
there were so many open questions

54:12.580 --> 54:15.900
after reading the proposal,

54:15.900 --> 54:18.820
and most of it came out of A,

54:19.980 --> 54:22.020
the high level of centrality,

54:22.020 --> 54:26.020
and B, like implicit assumptions about knowledge

54:26.020 --> 54:29.980
and where the knowledge can actually be

54:29.980 --> 54:32.380
brought together at the end.

54:32.380 --> 54:35.500
And this, yeah, this was just something

54:35.500 --> 54:38.300
I ended up with at the end.

54:38.300 --> 54:39.860
This is not really a question.

54:39.980 --> 54:44.620
Well, thank you for expressing this.

54:44.620 --> 54:49.620
This is a sort of an early stab, a first attempt here,

54:50.580 --> 54:52.780
and we don't claim that our modeling here,

54:52.780 --> 54:54.580
it's certainly not been the pause of our thought.

54:54.580 --> 54:56.220
We continue to think about these issues.

54:56.220 --> 54:58.820
We've continued to read new stuff,

54:58.820 --> 55:00.620
think new stuff, think about new models.

55:00.620 --> 55:05.620
So, I would really love to read more of other people's

55:06.860 --> 55:09.780
thinking about how we might build a non-monetary economy

55:10.780 --> 55:13.780
an economy that does manage to navigate

55:13.780 --> 55:16.980
the very difficult challenge of the environmental crisis

55:16.980 --> 55:19.740
and the amount of coordination that involves

55:19.740 --> 55:24.740
without the undesirable consequence of over-centralization

55:26.300 --> 55:28.900
or of our current system,

55:28.900 --> 55:32.300
which is complete and blindly walking into disaster

55:32.300 --> 55:35.860
that, and everyone is blind to the full picture

55:35.860 --> 55:38.460
or not everyone, but like that we're all making

55:38.460 --> 55:40.660
small decisions based on small incentives

55:40.660 --> 55:45.580
and it's creating a force that just leading us to ruin.

55:46.540 --> 55:50.340
So obviously we need a middle ground, right?

55:50.340 --> 55:52.860
How does that middle ground get constructed?

55:52.860 --> 55:54.340
And what we've tried to do,

55:55.340 --> 55:57.140
and so I guess I'll respond to a couple of the comments.

55:57.140 --> 55:58.820
So about technology never being neutral,

55:58.820 --> 56:01.540
this is of course true.

56:01.540 --> 56:06.540
And about technocracy never being neutral is of course true.

56:06.780 --> 56:07.940
True.

56:07.940 --> 56:12.140
What we tried to do is try and,

56:12.140 --> 56:14.380
but we also think that there needs to be some,

56:15.580 --> 56:19.220
I guess, administrative division of labor.

56:19.220 --> 56:22.020
We don't want everyone coming into meetings every day

56:22.020 --> 56:23.900
to plan things, I guess.

56:23.900 --> 56:26.420
So there's some amount of administrative division of labor.

56:26.420 --> 56:29.380
So we imagine still a parliament sort of system.

56:29.380 --> 56:33.940
So we have this sort of elected official sort of thing

56:33.940 --> 56:37.020
going on, which is already a compromise.

56:37.020 --> 56:40.460
We all know how representative democracy has its failings.

56:41.460 --> 56:43.820
And so there's all these compromises we're trying to make

56:43.820 --> 56:45.540
along the way to try and balance

56:45.540 --> 56:46.980
all these different tendencies.

56:46.980 --> 56:49.300
And that technology is never neutral,

56:49.300 --> 56:52.340
it's an important one, but that technology is,

56:53.220 --> 56:55.220
that the tools that we have developed

56:55.220 --> 56:57.860
to think about the world system,

56:57.860 --> 57:00.740
the earth system scientifically,

57:00.740 --> 57:05.740
seem to have promise in balancing environmental constraints

57:07.780 --> 57:08.900
is also there.

57:08.900 --> 57:11.860
And the question is, can we use this technology

57:11.860 --> 57:16.860
in a way that is democratic and is able to be just?

57:19.900 --> 57:20.980
I guess we're optimistic.

57:20.980 --> 57:21.900
Yeah.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.660
But I don't know, I'm sort of trailing off here, Troy.

57:23.660 --> 57:24.500
What do you want to say?

57:24.500 --> 57:25.340
Yeah, it's true.

57:25.340 --> 57:26.460
I think you can see too much.

57:26.460 --> 57:28.780
I mean, yeah, and I would push you to formulate

57:28.780 --> 57:31.900
your questions or your criticism more clearly.

57:31.900 --> 57:35.500
I mean, are you saying like, okay, no,

57:35.500 --> 57:38.980
there's no one mind with all the knowledge in the world.

57:38.980 --> 57:41.100
And I mean, it's kind of Hayekian argument.

57:41.100 --> 57:44.420
And you're like, okay, sure, I agree.

57:44.420 --> 57:47.340
But I mean, and this is why, again,

57:47.340 --> 57:50.460
we're talking about having these layered plans.

57:51.460 --> 57:54.220
Like the central planning, the global planning bureau

57:54.220 --> 57:56.060
will set fairly loose guidelines

57:56.220 --> 57:59.180
according to these planetary boundaries

57:59.180 --> 58:01.260
and orders boundaries for a good life.

58:01.260 --> 58:04.260
Like how many calories or energy does a person need?

58:04.260 --> 58:06.100
And then how to actually carry that out

58:06.100 --> 58:10.220
will be left up to regional and local government.

58:11.780 --> 58:16.220
And so I think there's that aspect.

58:16.220 --> 58:17.380
So I would agree with that,

58:17.380 --> 58:20.220
but we don't make this claim of having total knowledge.

58:20.220 --> 58:23.420
And then of course, technology isn't neutral.

58:23.420 --> 58:27.980
I mean, sure, but I also would say that cybernetics

58:27.980 --> 58:32.780
being some kind of like wicked military form of thinking

58:32.780 --> 58:35.380
is also a too simple critique.

58:35.380 --> 58:36.500
Not that I'm saying you're saying that,

58:36.500 --> 58:37.980
but some people are of course,

58:37.980 --> 58:40.140
are very skeptical of cybernetics for this reason.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.900
I mean, Beer was a huge hippie.

58:43.380 --> 58:48.380
Wiener himself was incredibly antagonistic

58:48.540 --> 58:52.100
to the military after the war as well.

58:52.100 --> 58:56.220
I mean, I think it's, and we're not proposing,

58:56.220 --> 58:58.780
yeah, merely, okay, we'll just see a bunch of experts

58:58.780 --> 58:59.620
to figure things out.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.100
That's not what we're saying.

59:01.100 --> 59:02.180
And again, we're trying to make this

59:02.180 --> 59:06.060
much more Noiratian point of you have to get

59:06.060 --> 59:08.300
as many people involved and as many people

59:08.300 --> 59:10.860
to understand what the economy is.

59:10.860 --> 59:13.380
And will that be perfect?

59:13.380 --> 59:17.300
Or will everyone have complete knowledge?

59:17.300 --> 59:20.180
No, but I think one should try.

59:20.180 --> 59:24.180
And then how exactly does one organize socialist democracy?

59:24.180 --> 59:25.660
Do we have referendums?

59:25.660 --> 59:27.300
Like, do we have a parliament?

59:27.300 --> 59:29.700
I mean, these are things we should be thinking about,

59:29.700 --> 59:31.980
but I think the alternative to say,

59:31.980 --> 59:33.260
oh, these things are too difficult.

59:33.260 --> 59:35.460
And therefore we have to do a market socialism

59:35.460 --> 59:38.300
and then rely on a market mechanism

59:38.300 --> 59:42.580
will not suffice to solve the problems we need to solve,

59:42.580 --> 59:45.700
which again, you know, mainly environmental problems.

59:45.700 --> 59:48.780
If we need to have us agree at the species,

59:48.820 --> 59:51.580
okay, we want to have only this much carbon emitted.

59:51.580 --> 59:54.660
We want to have only this much land deforested.

59:54.660 --> 59:57.580
If we want to stop climate change or the sixth extinction,

59:57.580 --> 59:59.260
if only part of us agree,

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.980
then it doesn't really matter what the rest of us do.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:06.420
So I mean, again, maybe if you could reformulate

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.980
what your critiques are, I'd be interested to hear it.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.100
Yes, absolutely.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.620
But first of all, I neither said that I think

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:19.620
that cybernetics is just some form of military wishwash

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.660
or anything as such.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.660
I just pointed out that it is not,

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.900
that all these theories are not neutral in any way,

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.940
but that they do imply some pre-assumptions

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.260
that make a difference.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.700
I'm absolutely pro, including cybernetics,

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.620
100% into our thinking.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.740
So I'm not actually stating that.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:42.100
Neither am I in any way, shape or form a market socialist.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.300
So if you pose it like either we do it your way

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.220
or people are market socialists,

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.420
then this is also an inadequate description

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.380
of the situation between the three of us right now,

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.980
because I'm not in favor of market socialism.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.460
So just to make that clear.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.900
And then maybe I can make it a bit more clear

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.220
when it comes to the question of detail,

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.220
because right now you stated that the central planning board

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:14.340
would only kind of give out some like broad guidelines

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.020
or something like that.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.820
And this would be something very different.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.980
And when I read the narrative part at the end of the book,

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:27.980
and this is the part that maybe created this sense

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:33.180
of over-centrality the most, I guess,

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.500
there were some points within this narrative

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.100
where people were like, all right, okay,

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.020
because of the central board deciding

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.420
that this labor should be allocated over there

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.100
and people should do X, Y, that over there,

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:54.980
we will now have to kind of try to enact it.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.260
And so there was a very clear sense

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.700
of this directionality coming from the center

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.420
in terms of the center has computed some kind of ideal plan.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:11.180
And I'm being polemic here a bit just to make the argument.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.540
There was this sense of there is this central board

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.980
computing this ideal plan.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.980
And now we will have to find ways to enact it.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.940
And this kind of directionality is important, I think,

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.380
because it will decide over the question

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.860
whether or not people do experience

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:35.700
democratic plant economies as democratic plant economies

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:42.260
in terms of democratic in all caps,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.380
because this, as you rightly stated before, Drew,

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.180
this is essential to actually making this work,

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.140
because if they do not, and you do not have any types

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.100
of monetary incentives or other forms of coercions,

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.620
then this whole thing will not work out.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:07.580
To me, it seems as if the way it is set up right now,

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.180
this form of over-centralization leads to a point

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:16.180
where the plan maybe by being too detailed

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:23.500
is first assuming epistemic aspects

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.140
that I guess I would not share in terms of

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.620
can this knowledge actually come together at this point?

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.940
And Troy, you were rightly so,

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.860
I think pointing towards tested knowledge

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.380
and the question of how to handle this one.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.820
So this is the first one.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.820
And then if it is too detailed,

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.500
and not only in the framework of like loose,

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.780
not loose, but broad guidelines,

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.820
you will come to a point where it will be experienced

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.540
as external by the people who will have to enact it.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.180
Those are the two things.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.580
And this makes a very big difference,

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.100
because if you, for example, look at models

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.820
where questions of economic planning are handled

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:09.820
through like prices for central categories of production,

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:16.100
then you will have a very broad set of indicative prices

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.140
that then kind of indirectly lead to a form

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:25.700
of coordination within the system in a very loose way.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.460
But I had the sense that within the proposal

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.180
that you are bringing forward,

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:36.180
this type of detail in terms of what is planned

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.660
and what is not planned and who is involved

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.140
in which aspects of planning is a very different one.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.660
So I hope this is a little bit more clear.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.140
Yeah, no, this is nice.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.020
And this is actually, this is a really good place

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.900
to be talking about the appropriate level of detail.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.900
And I definitely think that this is,

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.380
I think the right area to be focusing on,

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.900
what is the appropriate level of detail

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.260
at each level of the plan, right?

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.220
We're imagining some sort of kind of federative, right?

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.020
Like structure right where that,

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.860
and then the concreteness goes down.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.500
And I think what we're trying to get out with the narrative,

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.140
and I think is insufficiently clear,

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.820
is that the planning and sort of the central valley

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.740
of Massachusetts would be done in terms of like,

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.780
how many, like we have these factories

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.540
and these farms here, here, and here,

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.740
and how much labor is required for each.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.980
And then if someone puts in an application for work

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.340
and they wanna live here,

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:37.500
like these are the options to choose from.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.540
That level of detail would be at that kind of county

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.980
to city level, I guess.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.180
And so this would not be set up by the US

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:50.340
or the Eastern US or the North America

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.020
or the global level, right?

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.580
It would be more like we need,

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.900
we think we want some vegetables, right?

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.620
And then we can grow some amount here, right?

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.380
But that was sort of what we were going for.

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.020
So we don't imagine that that,

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.060
we imagine that that detail is more local.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.260
From there, we can have a conversation

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.860
about whether that's too much or too little detail.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.220
And I think that would be a really,

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.740
that's the sort of, I think,

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.460
really nice conversation that I would love to have

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.380
in this sort of discussions of how we might do planning.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.220
And the question of,

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.980
do you, quantities, do you do indicative prices?

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:28.820
Do you do, what is your mechanism for doing this?

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:32.380
We've been talking about sort of in the Torah units.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.220
So like, we, I guess, have been leaning more

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.540
on the sort of quota such quantity side of planning,

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.820
but perhaps there could be a case

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:43.060
that in for playing certain aspects of things,

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.420
an indicative price and then allowing things to do this

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.460
in some controlled way might be a reasonable way

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.060
of doing local planning or something like this.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:53.620
I think we kind of intentionally leave it a little vague

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.020
about how these plans are carried out.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.100
So I think,

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.820
I don't actually think we disagree very much,

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.660
which is of course a classic thing for me to say,

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.140
but I think, I don't actually think we,

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.500
I think this is the sort of detail

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.220
that we kind of didn't flush out too much in the book,

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.460
maybe to our own detriment.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.460
The book is quite short, just for listeners to know.

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.980
We cover a lot of ground at a very high level,

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.940
which might get us in trouble.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.820
But I think,

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.100
I think that this is a good conversation.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.420
I would be nice to build up a more detailed model

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.620
to like answer all these questions

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.820
and try and think about like,

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:27.940
what the right level of detail is,

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.820
what planning tools might be used at different levels?

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.140
What is the appropriate level of detail at different levels

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.540
in terms of both information gathering

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.460
and in terms of both experiencing it

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.980
as a non-coercive system?

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.460
I don't know if that was coherent,

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.820
but those are my thoughts to what you just said.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.580
Yes, and I mean, I just want to point out

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.140
that there were a couple of things

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.500
that I really liked about reading all of this.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.460
So that it's not that I was reading

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.460
and it was constantly thinking,

01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:01.460
oh my God, this is too authoritarian central planning.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.860
There were quite some elements that I really enjoyed.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.500
For example, this whole engagement

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.260
with the question of modeling

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:14.500
and how this could be a nested way of modeling

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.180
in order to kind of avoid this idea

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:22.220
of just having one central point

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.180
where the data comes together.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.620
Because as you state in the book,

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.740
in the case of climate modeling and weather modeling,

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.380
this could never be accurate

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:36.340
because you will have to have a form of nested approach

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.500
in order to get to a point

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:43.500
where you will be able to more or less get a picture

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.100
and an idea of a very, very dynamic system

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.780
that you are trying to get an idea of.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:53.540
So I thought this was really interesting

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.860
and I immediately thought,

01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.340
okay, well, this would be interesting

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.180
to get into contact with some people

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.340
who are actually doing this

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.860
and how this could be then re-appropriated

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:11.860
to kind of use this Neurethian innatura approach

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:16.500
that you obviously like very much.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.860
And since this was a really big question mark for me,

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:25.860
how would this innatura calculation actually look like?

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.860
I didn't really immediately had an inner image or idea

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.060
how this would be approached in concrete terms

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.140
because of course there are so many things

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.100
that a modern economy is made up of

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.660
that comparing everything innatura, of course,

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:48.260
kind of brings you in a difficult spot as well.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.300
And since I was very much interested

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.380
in how to approach actual innatura calculation

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.420
in modern economies, and on the other hand,

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:00.100
you were pointing towards these types of modern modeling,

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.580
I was very much intrigued in how this would go about

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.420
or how do you think about this pair

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:11.100
which I was perceiving as an interesting fit actually.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.500
I suppose like the next step for this kind of project

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.980
would be to think more seriously

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.740
about making like a world model, right?

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:24.740
And then, or work with people on regional or local model.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.780
Let's just assume the global model says this,

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.340
and how would, let's say, Austria figure it out

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.620
and what would Vienna look like based on those constraints

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.100
and kind of work it out.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.660
I think this is, again, the Neurathian part

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.060
where socialism is imagining these features

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.180
and having discussions about how we should live.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.380
But you're right where I think the innatura

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:58.140
parts of the plan would have to be a different radiance

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.220
of detail, and I think,

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.700
and I can imagine, you would just say,

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.260
like how large is the chemical industry

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:12.180
or how many fertilizer or pesticides do you want?

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:15.220
And then, as in you could have some kind of way

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.460
to group that, but then there would also be a way

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.540
to zero in and say, okay, what does that look like

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:25.060
in terms of phosphorus versus ammonia and so forth, right?

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:28.060
And I think you want to have enough,

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.420
less detail to look at these things in total,

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.260
which again, we try to get into the book

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.340
because we want people to really engage

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.700
with these questions of energy and land use

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.140
and the kind of nature we want.

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.140
And then one can zero in if they want.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.620
Great, so at the end of every interview,

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.220
I ask my guests, if you think about the future,

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.900
what makes you joyful?

01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.100
I think writing this book has been a joyful experience

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.620
because at some level, I think it's possible for us

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.220
to overcome the environmental crisis

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.020
and to overcome capitalism

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.940
and to ensure the good life for all

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.580
without sliding into some horrible dictatorship.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:18.460
I think it's not beyond humanity at some level.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.820
And we just want to convince more people

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:23.860
that this is the case,

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.380
because otherwise there's too much doom and gloom.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.220
Yeah, I think in writing this book,

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.260
we've encountered people who are thinking very hard

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:35.860
about issues like the practical details

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.260
of transcending capitalism

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.220
rather than simply critiquing, critiquing, critiquing.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.020
It's easy to critique, but as soon as you offer something,

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.980
then people can come after you,

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.300
which is good because it helps us refine our ideas.

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.380
But it's being introduced to all these people

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.740
thinking about these issues has been really, really wonderful.

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:58.460
And it makes me very excited that we can hammer out

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.380
the details in an appropriate way

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.420
that we are able to walk these many tight ropes

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.620
that we'll need to walk to build the future we all want.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.100
Great, and I hope you didn't get the sense

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.020
that I was coming after you because I wasn't.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.780
I really enjoyed that you were putting out

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.940
this concrete ideas on how things could be approached

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.420
because I absolutely agree that we do need more

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.740
of this type of engagement

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:31.180
with how things could actually be done differently.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:37.020
No, no, I mean, this Think Tank podcast is amazing

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.300
because there aren't that many that really get

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.860
into the nitty-gritty of planning theory.

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.180
And it's been a real joy to listen to your podcast

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:50.340
and to have a place where we can really get into the weeds

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.540
of some of the more obscure stuff in the book

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.220
because not everyone wants to talk about Soviet mathematics.

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.100
So thanks so much for having us.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.220
Thank you too.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.180
Yeah, this was really great.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.860
Yeah, it would be wonderful to talk even more

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:10.620
and think more and maybe we have this iterative democracy

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.980
thing for a Philip Dapricks conference

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.300
in late June, early July.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.820
So maybe we could get more feedback there.

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.620
So, I mean, we're still working and thinking.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.820
So, I mean, hopefully we can continue to talk

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.460
and develop ideas.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.300
Perfect.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.420
