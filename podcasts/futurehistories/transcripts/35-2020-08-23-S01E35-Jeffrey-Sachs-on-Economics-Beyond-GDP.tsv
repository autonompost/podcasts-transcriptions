0	7360	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and my guest today is the economist Jeffrey Sachs.
7360	15280	I recorded this interview during last year's Globe Art Academy and I hesitated to release it for mainly two reasons.
15280	20320	The first one is that this interview came about more or less spontaneously
20320	24960	and I wasn't able to prepare myself as much as I usually do.
25040	32640	I also like spontaneous interviews, don't get me wrong, but in most cases I like to come prepared.
32640	39360	This was one of those cases and so this was a minus on my part actually.
39360	44240	And the second reason I didn't release the interview yet is that it's not complete.
44240	51760	Mr Sachs was kind enough to lend me his time immediately before his keynote speech at the Globe Art Academy
51840	56720	and then time ran out and we had to stop the interview before getting to some of the more
56720	62880	delicate questions in my notes. And I say delicate because Mr Sachs is a many-sided person
62880	67680	and I would have loved to get to better understand how these different sides fit together.
68240	74160	Just to give you an example, Mr Sachs was an advisor to Yanis Varoufakis during his time as
74160	80080	Greek Finance Minister and he endorsed Bernie Sanders as the Democrat presidential candidate,
80080	85920	which surely was a great help to the movement since Mr Sachs is an important figure in economics
85920	92320	and many try to frame Bernie Sanders' approach as specifically economically unreasonable,
92320	101120	which of course isn't true, but in these cases it of course helps to be endorsed by a person such as
101120	108160	Mr Sachs. On the other side, Mr Sachs was also at least partly responsible for what is called a
108160	113920	shock therapy approach and the economic liberalization of former communist countries
113920	120640	after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This arguably has a big part in oligarchic structures
120640	127120	within these economies today and it would have been very interesting to ask the Jeffrey Sachs of
127120	133920	2019 whether or not he would have done things differently given his views on politics and
133920	141200	economics today. Unfortunately, we didn't get to this part, but nonetheless we covered a lot of
141200	147760	interesting and important ground, so thanks a lot to the Globe Art Academy for making this interview
147760	155120	possible and my warmest greetings to everybody at the Globe Art team. Before we get to the interview,
155120	161680	I wanted to welcome Simona and the person with the pseudonym Monster aus dem Loch as Patreons.
162400	168560	Thank you so much for your support and since one of the questions during today's episode is
168560	174560	directed towards the possibility of different kinds of political economies, I wanted to point
174560	182800	you all towards episodes 31 and 32 of Future Histories with radical economist Daniel E.
182800	189280	Sarros as a guest. In these two episodes we take a deep dive into Daniel Sarros' book
189280	194720	Information Technology and Socialist Construction, which I highly recommend when
194720	200960	it comes to the question of how fundamentally different political economies could actually
200960	207040	look like. But now please enjoy today's episode with Jeffrey Sachs.
212960	217760	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and my guest today is Jeffrey Sachs,
217760	221280	economist, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University,
221840	226800	special advisor to the United Nations, secretary general and one of the world's leading experts
226800	230880	on economic development. Welcome Mr. Sachs. Thank you, great to be with you.
232080	238160	Mr. Sachs, all too often political actions are justified by economic parameters such as the GDP,
238160	243280	for example, the gross domestic product. Yet these numbers do not represent the actual
243280	249520	well-being of humans, animals, the ecological environment or anything as such, as well as it
249520	255200	doesn't factor in the future well-being of any of these. So I'd say it's high time for different
255200	260960	parameters to measure our actions against what could those be and what to do about the things
260960	269760	that cannot be measured but are equally important. We do indeed in almost all countries follow the
269760	278720	indicator of gross domestic product and I happened as a young student to be a student of
278720	286480	then emeritus, a very senior, very wonderful professor, Simon Kuznets, who invented the gross
286480	295760	domestic product. He developed it between 1919 and the 1930s when he came up with this concept
295760	304720	and won a Nobel Prize for it. But he always used to emphasize this is not a measure of our well-being.
304720	311120	This is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a measure of the market transactions taking
311120	319120	place in an economy. It's useful to know it was originally designed to help governments plan,
319200	327040	interestingly, to help them plan for two purposes. One, for war because in a war governments need to
327040	335280	requisition resources and for war planning they need to know how big the economy is and how to
335280	344720	mobilize those resources. It also then became used starting in the 1930s for macroeconomic policies
345680	354640	to fight depressions, to fight the contractions of a business cycle. It became part of macroeconomics,
354640	364560	the field invented by John Maynard Keynes. It was not then and until today, not now, a measure of
365120	372720	whether the economy is serving the people, whether it is promoting well-being, whether it is
372800	379680	protecting or destroying the environment, whether it is promoting or taking away from longevity.
380240	388560	In other words, a tremendous amount is missed from this indicator. But crazily enough, it is
388560	397680	probably the most watched number in any economy by the business sector and by the broad public
398320	406080	in almost any place in the entire world. So that's the long answer to your question,
406080	416160	do we need a new measure? Absolutely. We need measures that track whether what we want out
416160	425120	of an economy, ability of people to meet their needs, the ability of people to live with comfort
425120	432560	and safety and dignity, the safety and sustainability of the natural environment,
433280	441520	the quality of our lives, the quality of our society in terms of trust, the functionality
441520	449680	of our governments in terms of honesty, competence or corruption. We need measures because those are
449680	458160	all important. And when you follow one measure to the exclusion of the other measures, you follow
459200	466720	or you pull, I should say, your economy and society right over a cliff. If you're following
466720	475360	a wrong goal, just maximize GDP. Of course, we're going to destroy the environment.
475360	482320	We're going to put favor of the mega wealth over the fairness of the society.
482880	486880	We're going to privilege things that are sold on markets, not things that are
487680	497040	non-markets such as our leisure time, our time with children, our own time for learning and so on.
497920	504400	So you follow the wrong measure, you pursue the wrong goals. It's as simple as that. And that's
504400	509920	why we need better goals and better measures for the things that are really important.
510800	516640	What could those be? Are there actually models that take all these things into account? Is there a
518800	522080	good way of approaching this that already has been established?
522720	532400	There is a worldwide movement, sometimes under the rubric beyond GDP, because it is really about
532400	541440	measurement other than GDP that is trying to answer your question. What should we be measuring?
542800	553360	There's one idea which I rather like and pursue, in fact, with colleagues, and that is to try to
553360	562160	measure happiness directly. How could you do that? We don't have a galvanometer to put on
562160	569520	your skin to measure how happy you are. So what is done is to ask people about their life satisfaction.
570080	577760	And then I and colleagues and now a whole worldwide industry of researchers
578480	585920	studies how people answer the question, are you satisfied with your life? Or on a scale from zero
585920	593520	to 10, where would you place your life from the worst to the best? The answers to that question
593520	600480	are very, very informative, even predictive of how people are going to vote, whether they support
601440	608880	populism, whether they are suffering, because an answer to that question also is often very revealing
608880	617120	of the mental illness or depression of people and so forth. One learns a lot about society from
617840	625120	looking at the changes over time in the answer to that question. In the United States, for example,
625680	632880	where that question has been asked for decades, we have seen over the last 15 years a significant
632880	642000	fall in the response to the measure of well-being. And it seems pretty clear that
642000	648960	Americans, my own country, are feeling worse and worse about many things. And so that is an important
648960	657280	indicator. The OECD, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the club of
657280	664960	the high-income democracies, Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and a few other
664960	677760	countries, has been pursuing a broader range of measures that are measures about quality of
678400	684320	the environment, measures about the work-life balance, leisure time,
684960	694400	measures about the quality of jobs, the safety of the work environment, the job satisfaction.
695200	702800	So they have come up with actually dozens of indicators. And what the OECD
703760	712080	staff says is, here are your indicators. They're all online. You can put the way to aggregate them
712080	717680	according to your own values. So we won't give you the weights to add up across all those different
717680	722480	dimensions. That's something for you to do. If you think that the most important issue
722480	727760	is leisure time, or you think the most important issue is life expectancy, or you think the most
727840	734240	important issue is the environment, well, take the indicators and you make your own
734240	742320	weighting. But their idea is that we don't know how to add. So we have to use our two eyes,
742320	749600	our two hands, our toes, our fingers to look at 20 or 30 indicators rather than just one or two
749600	756000	indicators. I think that has a lot of merit also. Now, there's another way that I work on,
756720	769280	which is to take into account that back in 2015, all 193 governments in the United Nations
769280	778480	unanimously adopted the sustainable development goals. These are 17 goals that in principle,
778480	785280	at least, are shared by all countries of the world. They include ending poverty, ending hunger,
786080	793920	promoting health, ensuring that all children of school age are in school, gender equality,
794800	803200	safe water and sanitation, renewable energy access, decent jobs, good infrastructure,
804080	812400	low income inequality, sustainable cities, circular economy that cuts
812400	822000	waste, control of climate change, protection of oceans, protection of land, ecosystems,
823920	828720	the rule of law and global partnerships. Now, if you were counting carefully,
828720	835280	you would have seen that I named 17 SDGs. Those are, and I know them because it's my job at the
835280	843040	UN to help advise how to achieve those 17. So, another thought that I very much subscribe to,
843040	851280	because I think these goals are very important, is to examine how the 193 countries of the world
851280	858400	are faring, whether they're making progress to achieve those goals or whether they're going
858400	864480	backwards or whether they're just treading water that they're neither going forward nor backward.
865040	874080	So, my colleagues and I at the UN produce each year what we call the SDG index. That is a single
874080	884480	number or a ranking which says if you take all 17 goals and you measure how each country is
884480	892320	performing on those 17 goals with a score of zero if it's the worst and a score of 100 if it's
892320	899680	achieved the goal and then you add up across the goals, take the average, then you get a score
900400	907360	and we find that some countries, especially in Europe, Austria is doing pretty well,
908560	916320	Scandinavia is doing even better in general, are making good progress towards the SDGs
916400	923280	and some of the poorest countries are in absolute desperate shape and really need the help of the
923280	928240	rich world but typically are not getting much help because our world is not a very generous
928240	938080	world these days. But that SDG index is another approach to your question, how can we measure
938080	946320	what's really valuable in life? That SDG index, if I could summarize it, says that societies have a
949600	957040	three-part objective. They want to be prosperous, they should or they claim to want to be fair
957600	963280	and they want to be environmentally sustainable. So, a high score means that you are both
963280	972160	economically, socially and environmentally on the right track. My own country, the United States,
972160	979600	comes in around 35th in the world on this, a pretty dismal score for such a rich country
981040	988560	and the reason is that the US is quite rich but it is not fair and it is not environmentally
988560	995360	sustainable. So, of those three pillars of sustainable development, the economic pillar,
995360	1000960	the social pillar and the environmental pillar, the US does well only on one of them, the economics,
1000960	1007680	very rich country, very technologically sophisticated country. But Boyer, we unfair
1007680	1014880	because the gap between the rich and the poor is the highest gap of any high-income country
1014960	1021120	and of course, we have a crazy president, Donald Trump, who thinks that it's his job to
1021680	1028560	increase the carbon emissions rather than to decrease the carbon emissions because he is
1029760	1036800	trying to help the coal, oil and gas industry to make more profits whereas what we know
1036800	1045840	scientifically is we have to get out of those fossil fuels and move to wind, solar, hydro,
1045840	1053280	geothermal energy. So, the US scores pretty poorly even though it's a rich country and that
1053280	1061680	to just add that long description is a good example of the question that you posed. Here is
1061680	1071360	a country, the US, very rich, very high GDP per person but not achieving the quality of life,
1071920	1078720	not achieving the protection of the environment, not achieving social justice. So, we want a measure
1078720	1087680	that says, aha, don't think you're so good. Your quality of life is evidently suffering and the SDG
1087680	1095760	index has that property that it flashes a warning red light to the United States you're on the wrong
1095760	1105840	track. And because you're talking about the question of fairness within the United States
1106400	1111600	but there's another aspect to the question of fairness which would be the international one
1111600	1118160	because for me at least living in a country like Austria where the social welfare net is at least
1118160	1123600	kind of working. I mean, it's getting worse but it's kind of working. And internationally seen,
1123600	1130640	it's of course pretty good. But still, at least for me, it's pretty striking that we are still
1130640	1139040	living on the backs of others. So, even Scandinavia, which might have a good ranking
1139040	1146800	within this score system, this kind of leaves out to factor in this fact that the western world is
1146800	1153360	actually living kind of on the backs of others and there are people dying on the borders,
1154240	1160880	there are like strong protectionist economic policies and stuff like that. Does that come
1160880	1168240	into play somehow? When our group, which is called the United Nations Sustainable Development
1168240	1178720	Solutions Network, makes this SDG index, we have tracked as closely as we can a large number of
1178720	1185760	what we call spillover effects, exactly the kind of problems that you're talking about.
1186400	1192480	For example, we may say we're green and environmental because we're using renewable
1192560	1199760	energy. But the products that we're buying from China or from other countries are produced with
1199760	1208320	fossil fuels. So, what we did was we shifted the production to other places and we don't count that
1208320	1218880	as part of our own effect on the environment. Or when we buy soybeans or buy meat that is coming
1218880	1227520	from Brazil and those soybeans are being produced on the fringe of the Amazon and contributing to
1227520	1233600	the deforestation and the forest fires that are underway, we wouldn't see that in our own
1233600	1242960	consumption but it's a very real effect. Or when we purchase a product and it has been produced with
1243600	1250080	bonded labor or child labor or slave labor, like the cobalt that's used in the batteries of
1250080	1256480	every one of our smartphones around the world coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo,
1256480	1264720	the DRC, and we know horrendous work conditions there, we don't take that into account.
1265840	1271680	The phone manufacturers say, well, that's not me, that's cobalt, I just buy it as an input.
1271680	1277840	But that is a direct effect. Now, some of the adverse effects are even starker than that.
1279760	1287600	Every two or three years, we have a scandal erupt because someone leaks the data on
1288720	1297680	the Panama files or the other tax havens or New York banks are shown to have been involved in the
1297680	1307280	mega-corruption in Malaysia and so forth. And these are treated then as, oh my God,
1307280	1312000	how did that happen? But of course, what we really know is that the tax cheating
1312640	1317760	and the secrecy is the system, it's not the exception. It is the way the system works.
1317760	1327360	There are tens of trillions of dollars that in the electronic ledgers are kept in the Caribbean
1327360	1334960	tax havens, even when there are almost no people in those countries, because under the law, which
1334960	1342160	is pretty lawless, those places don't charge taxes on the mega-rich. We've just had data
1342160	1348640	come out in the United States in the last few days that the billionaires now are paying less
1348640	1358720	than the working class in the most recent tax year. And the billionaires use these tax havens.
1360080	1368400	Even more direct effects, of course, are when the US or Sweden or others sell armaments to
1369440	1376560	the Middle East that then end up killing people in Yemen or killing people in Syria or killing
1376560	1382400	people in Afghanistan and so forth. That is a pretty direct spillover effect that comes out of
1383440	1390240	the bay of a bomber. It kills a lot of people. So we try to measure those spillovers. That's
1390240	1395120	one of the reasons why the rich countries definitely are not scored as achieving
1395120	1404400	the sustainable development goals. And one of the key alleged planks, self-declared planks,
1404400	1411920	of the SDGs is SDG 17, partnerships of the rich and the poor countries. But I'd say in general,
1411920	1419360	the rich countries are pretty lousy partners because they do not really honestly look at what
1419360	1429520	poor countries need in order to escape from poverty or to escape from the environmental
1429520	1436480	crisis and so on. Of course, the poor countries need to govern themselves properly, but they have
1436480	1444240	every right, literally right, to expect that the rich countries will be acting honestly,
1444240	1450880	fairly, and without all of these dire spillovers. The poor countries also have the right to expect
1450880	1455920	financial help from the rich countries, but that also comes only in small amounts.
1456000	1462080	There is a category of spending called official development assistance, sometimes called foreign
1462080	1469600	aid. That's what governments in the rich countries give to governments in the poor countries. We're
1469600	1476560	not very generous about that. The total amount of so-called foreign aid or official development
1476560	1485760	assistance is about one-third of 1% of the income of the rich world. And that's a very
1486080	1496160	in the United States, it's less than half of that. Well, it's about half, about 0.16 or one-sixth
1496160	1504960	of 1% of US GDP. So we're really nasty and greedy in not providing help for the poorest people
1504960	1512000	in the world. Now, here the Scandinavian countries do better. They're providing about 1% of the
1512000	1517360	national income in development aid. Austria could do much better. It's such a rich,
1517920	1525680	beautiful country, and it wants people to stay home and not be migrants massively to this country.
1525680	1530800	But one way to do that is to ensure development in the poor countries so that people have a
1530800	1535920	future in their own countries. And that does require that the rich countries step up and
1535920	1541520	help to provide the health care, the education, the infrastructure that makes it possible for
1541520	1546560	the poorest countries to develop. So that's definitely an area where Austria could do a lot
1546560	1554800	more. And isn't it a problem that oftentimes when financial aid is given, that it is given
1556320	1564400	tied to certain obligations? Conditions. Yeah, conditions, oftentimes economic conditions of
1564400	1570320	privatization, opening the markets in order to let international corporations come into the country
1570320	1579680	and take over the markets. And yeah. Well, the aid is given for all sorts of reasons
1580240	1589840	of which fighting poverty is often way down on the list. One reason why aid is given is purely
1589840	1595280	for military or foreign policy reasons. And often those foreign policy reasons are
1595760	1603760	a pretty unpleasant ones. The U.S. has a lot of allies that are rather thuggish countries.
1604560	1612000	Those countries get aid because the U.S. wants those countries as allies. Maybe there's a U.S.
1612000	1620320	military base there, for example. There's a famous phrase about why aid is being given to
1621120	1629520	particularly horrible country. And the statement is that the leader is really a son of a bitch.
1630160	1635760	And the answer is, well, he's a son of a bitch, but he's at least our son of a bitch.
1636400	1642960	And this is a real problem with foreign aid. Too much of it is about war, the military,
1643680	1651360	or foreign policy alliances. Conditions on foreign aid that
1652560	1658480	are conditions that the aid should be used correctly are conditions I believe in. In other
1658480	1666480	words, if you say, I'm going to help country X to keep the children in school, then putting
1666480	1670800	the condition that the money we're giving, we want to see the schools and the teachers,
1670800	1675280	and we want verification, and we're going to audit that program, that's perfectly appropriate
1675280	1682320	in my view. Because if you give the help for a reason, it should actually be fulfilled.
1683200	1693840	If the aid is given instead, look at the crisis in the United States with our absolutely dangerous
1693840	1699360	president, Donald Trump, who's surely the worst president we've ever had in American history.
1700320	1707760	He's giving aid to Ukraine, we now know, based on the Ukrainian government agreeing to
1708880	1716320	investigate Donald Trump's political foes. Oh, this is straight corruption in the United States,
1716320	1723760	so the aid is being used for the political objectives of the president of the United States,
1724720	1730080	not anything about Ukraine, and not just the objectives of the president of the United States,
1730080	1736800	absolutely constitutionally illegal objectives. So we're rooting for impeachment, I can say,
1736800	1745920	just as a parentheses, but the point is that aid gets given for all sorts of reasons. Now,
1745920	1752240	but let me clear up one important point, because I've been involved in this question for a quarter
1752240	1759840	century, very intensively, often day to day. Once in a while, aid is given for the right reason,
1760560	1768240	to fight a disease, to help children in school, to ensure access to safe water and sanitation
1768240	1776080	and so on. And I just want to assure everybody that when aid is well-intentioned and professionally
1776080	1783440	directed, it actually works. So the most important point is that development aid
1783440	1788480	can really help poor people, help them to stay alive, help the children to get vaccinated,
1788480	1794560	help the mothers to survive childbirth, help to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and many other
1794560	1801440	incredibly important, wonderful things. And it can be done honestly and professionally.
1802400	1812320	So we shouldn't confuse the fact that the likes of Donald Trump or George W. Bush misuse aid
1812320	1818960	as a general condemnation of the concept of rich countries helping poor countries,
1818960	1826960	because rich countries have a moral obligation and a practical need to help poor countries.
1826960	1834400	We don't want a world of instability, of starvation, of mass force migration. And
1834400	1841600	when we're serious about it, which our governments are too infrequently serious,
1842400	1845840	but when we are serious about it, the aid can actually work.
1847360	1852560	One of the things that I'm arguing for in this podcast is the need for a plurality of political
1852640	1858080	economies. This brings up a couple of problems and open questions, of course. One of these
1858080	1863040	problems is the repression of alternatives when it comes to the political economy on a national
1863040	1869120	level. At least from my perspective, it seems as if the moment a movement comes into power that
1869120	1875280	wants to do things substantially different, and Syriza and Greece would be an example for this,
1876000	1880960	then there are very effective mechanisms in place that are able to prevent this from succeeding.
1881680	1886240	First of all, I'd like to know if you would agree with this assessment. I guess Venezuela
1886240	1892560	would be a second contemporary example. Allende in Chile in the 70s would be a historical third,
1892560	1897840	but the list goes on and on. So first of all, I'd like to know if you'd agree. And if yes,
1897840	1903280	could you explain to us some of the mechanisms, the toolkits that are being used in order to
1903280	1908800	prevent this plurality of approaches towards political economy from happening?
1908800	1917760	Well, it's a little bit complicated because if you take the case of Greece, for example,
1918800	1929680	the fact of the matter is Greece largely got itself into a mega crisis. The governments
1929680	1937120	in Greece borrowed too much in the first decade of this century, ran up big budget deficits.
1937440	1944080	Then the financial crisis came, and oh my God, they owed so much they couldn't repay.
1944720	1956240	So the starting point of the Greek crisis was rather bad luck combined with rather lax
1956480	1966960	economic policies. No country should expect that they can overspend what they have
1967600	1974160	and get away with it for a long term. If you look at Venezuela, it's not different from that,
1974160	1981280	actually. In the case of Hugo Chavez and then his successor,
1981520	1991040	they followed a rather classic left populist strategy of Latin America, which is that
1991040	2002640	Venezuela is an oil country. When oil prices were high, Chavez spent very, very amply and
2002960	2012480	and overspent, borrowed against future oil earnings. Then oil prices collapsed in the
2012480	2022000	world markets in 2014. Chavez died of cancer. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, is not so clever
2022960	2032080	and spent down the country's reserves. Basically, Venezuela went broke around 2017.
2033440	2043600	Now, in both of those cases, one could say that the alternative project wasn't so accurate.
2045760	2057200	I can tell you as a personal matter, I went to see Mr. Chavez in 2002 in Caracas. I know a thing
2057200	2065200	or two about the Venezuelan economy because I worked on it. I studied it. I know a lot about
2065200	2075200	oil rich economies from a lot of professional experience. I warned him, don't live only on oil.
2076160	2081520	Don't keep your exchange rate overvalued. Don't borrow against your future income.
2082160	2088800	I have to say either he heard the opposite of what I said each time because he didn't hear the
2088800	2096400	don't and he thought I said do, or of course, more realistically, he had other things in mind
2096400	2102880	and wasn't interested in listening to a university professor from Columbia University. But the fact
2102880	2110880	of the matter is the economy was badly mismanaged. Now, having said that, there are two very important
2110880	2119440	things to understand. One is that when countries get into economic crisis, really for whatever
2119440	2130960	reason, out of their own mistakes or by international bad luck or by some pressure from abroad and often
2130960	2141760	it's a mix of those, we should never tolerate mass suffering because for whatever reason a crisis
2141760	2150720	comes, mass suffering is immoral in this world and very dangerous. It leads to terrible outcomes.
2150800	2160080	People die, children die, there's mass hunger, there's destitution, there's disarray, and in
2161200	2168960	Greece there was an extremely serious economic crisis. So I tried to help several Greek governments,
2168960	2178400	in fact, when George Papandreou was prime minister and then when Mr. Tsipras was prime minister,
2178400	2183920	so really across the political spectrum, I tried to help by saying to the Germans,
2183920	2190480	look, you're the creditors, but you can't just squeeze this country so brutally because the
2190480	2198720	pain that's involved is absolutely brutal. Well, they didn't listen and I think the outcomes
2198720	2205680	were far more serious, negative and harmful than they ever should have been. Maybe Greece is
2205680	2210480	starting to come out of that right now, but there still is a massive overhang of debt
2210480	2217280	that should have been lifted from the books years ago. In the case of Venezuela, it is worse than
2217280	2225040	that because it's not just that the world didn't come to the aid of Venezuela. When Donald Trump
2225040	2234560	came to power, because Trump is a thug, he decided that he would try to overthrow Maduro. Now, this is
2235040	2242560	absolutely against international law. It's against common sense. It's against basic decency
2242560	2250960	and it is a very bad habit of the United States because the US is a kind of neo-colonial power.
2250960	2257040	It is the world's most powerful country and it has a very bad track record of overthrowing
2257680	2265760	governments of other countries. I was quite aghast at this. Donald Trump even told
2265760	2272560	Latin American leaders, maybe we'll just invade directly. He said that in September 2017 at a
2272560	2278000	private dinner of a number of Latin American presidents who subsequently told me about the
2278000	2286240	dinner conversation. That's not just not helping. That is being a thuggish. That is being absolutely
2286240	2292960	reckless. Well, it got worse than that because Trump, rather than invading, decided to squeeze
2294160	2301200	the life out of the Venezuelan economy. They were bankrupt already but then
2302480	2311920	Donald Trump essentially said, we will block Venezuela's access to the financial markets,
2311920	2320080	starting with the oil companies, the main oil company in the middle of 2017. Then in January
2320080	2329280	2019, just this year, Trump issued an order which said, you can't do business anymore and we're
2329280	2337600	going to seize the assets of the Venezuelan government. The situation went from a self-inflicted
2338320	2345600	wound, which Venezuela certainly had inflicted on itself, to what is a human catastrophe
2346320	2355280	created by the United States. Hunger, a lack of access to medicines. It's an extraordinarily cruel
2355280	2365040	policy. It is a war on the civilian population, not through a military attack but through a denial
2365040	2376080	of food. Our international system is extremely weak at stopping that. Where is Europe to say to
2376080	2383600	the United States, you can't do that? Well, Europe barely has a foreign policy. It needs one. It needs
2383600	2389360	a backbone to say to the United States, you can't get away with such thuggery. In fact,
2389360	2395120	Europe has said, well, Maduro is a dictator, so we don't really want to stop the US pressure and
2395120	2402800	so on, but the means of pressure is absolutely immoral and illegal. To answer your question,
2404080	2410320	it's a bit complicated. Countries get themselves into trouble, but then I have two rules. One,
2410960	2419280	when a country and a population is in trouble, they need help, period. These are human beings
2419520	2428400	and leaving countries to suffer is a gigantic mistake, but worse than that, if you add on to
2428400	2439520	the pressure and the US has a bad habit of doing this, then it's worse than merely a lack of effort.
2440240	2449360	It's actually, in my view, a crime against the domestic population. Now, I can tell you that
2450240	2460720	in this story, we are at the 100th anniversary of the Versailles Treaty and everyone should
2460720	2468320	note and remember the meaning of that. 100 years ago at the end of World War I,
2469600	2481040	France and Britain put heavy reparations on Germany at the defeated country and the victors
2481040	2488080	said that the defeated country would have to bear an intolerable burden. The great economist John
2488080	2494480	Maynard Keynes wrote in 1919 in one of the most important books of the 20th century called The
2494480	2503280	Economic Consequences of the Peace. It is a mistake to levy such a harsh peace on Germany because it
2503280	2509920	will lead to a backlash. He said within a generation, if this is done, there will be a
2509920	2516240	terrible price to pay. Of course, it was 14 years later that Hitler came to power,
2516880	2524800	in part because of the devastating economic conditions of Germany. We should never push
2524800	2530080	countries through economic policies to despair, whether it's at the end of a war,
2530720	2539440	whether it's because of even the self-inflicted wound of overborrowing, which gets a country into
2539440	2548800	a debt crisis, or because a president of the United States doesn't like the political party
2548800	2554880	in power in another country. All of that is extraordinarily dangerous and we should have
2554880	2560480	learned the lesson of the 20th century and we should not be driving countries to despair.
2560960	2569600	And if you look at what we're doing today, it's not only Venezuela, it's not only the harshness
2569600	2577920	with which Greece was treated. Iran, because of the US again, is being squeezed to the point of
2577920	2584960	hunger and despair through US sanctions and Europe opposes those sanctions but doesn't really fight
2584960	2591600	them adequately. They just say, oh, we can't really do anything. The United States, you know,
2591600	2598480	it's an important market and our businesses don't want to violate US sanctions. Well,
2598480	2604320	Europe should have a backbone and should stand up and say the US sanctions are against international
2604320	2611280	law, they're against common sense, they're against the Europe's security interests, they're against
2611280	2616160	the world's security interests, and we absolutely reject them and will not honor them.
2618400	2624320	I'm so terribly sorry that we have to stop this interview at this moment because I'm being signaled
2624320	2631280	that it's time to move on. I would have had so many more questions, but unfortunately,
2631280	2635760	it's no time. Well, I hope we can do it again sometime. Thanks a lot for taking the time,
2635760	2638400	Mr. Sachs. Great to speak with you. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
