0	5760	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome
5760	8160	Sören Mao in today's episode.
8160	14720	Sören is a communist philosopher and author of the brilliant book Mute Compulsion, a Marxist
14720	20440	Theory of the Economic Power of Capital, which I enjoyed reading a lot.
20440	25960	And by the way, it's also available in German under the title Stummerzwang, eine Marxistische
25960	32280	Analyse der ökonomischen Macht im Kapitalismus, published by the great Karl Dietz Verlag.
32280	34440	So go and get it.
34440	40860	More recently, an essay by Sören titled Communism as Freedom has been translated from Danish
40860	46280	in multiple languages actually, so it's available in English as well.
46280	51040	Both of these works, the book as well as the essay, are relevant for the conversation you're
51040	52600	about to hear.
52600	58480	Before we start, I'd like to thank Lukas, Fabian and Wilfried for their kind donations
58480	64200	and welcome Markus, Daniel and Jakob as patrons of Future Histories.
64200	65800	Thank you so much.
65800	68520	And then some quick social media news.
68520	75720	You can now follow Future Histories on Blue Sky as well, so go and follow, I guess.
75720	80840	And since I never mentioned it before on the podcast on air, there's also a Future Histories
80840	82880	newsletter you can subscribe to.
82880	85240	So you might do that as well.
85240	96680	But now please enjoy today's episode with Sören Mao on planning and freedom.
96680	98300	Welcome Sören.
98300	99300	Thank you.
99300	100680	And thank you so much for inviting me.
100680	106600	Sören, I'm absolutely convinced that freedom and security are two crucial pillars that
106600	111820	must be positively occupied when constructing alternative political imaginaries.
111820	116960	So I was extremely happy to see you make such a strong and very clear-minded case for
116960	120280	why communism is freedom.
120280	125160	Could you explain to us why communism is freedom and why security is part of the package as
125160	126160	well?
126160	132440	Well, I think that for me, freedom is kind of like the guiding principle for thinking
132520	136720	about how to organize a communist society.
136720	141440	And maybe the reason for that is that, or it has to do with what I think the problem
141440	143480	with capitalism is.
143480	149920	I wouldn't emphasize, first of all, that it's an unjust system of exploitation or that it's
149920	153160	alienating, for example.
153160	158560	But I would argue that the most important reason why, or the thing that's first of
158800	164000	all wrong with capitalism is that it implies domination, that it's an enemy of freedom,
164000	170960	that capitalism is an economic system that prohibits people from living the life they
170960	172160	want to live.
172160	176120	And that's what I write about in my book, Mute Compulsion, that capitalism is a system
176120	177120	of domination.
177120	184120	So it kind of follows from that critique of capitalism that we should think of an alternative
184120	190200	to capitalism as a way of avoiding domination, as creating a society with the highest possible
190200	191280	degree of freedom.
191280	196160	So that's how I think about what communism should be.
196160	202200	So that's my guiding principle to think of a society with the highest degree of freedom.
202200	209720	So in that sense, I think freedom is the first and most important principle maybe of communism.
209720	212680	And how does this relate to the question of security?
212680	223240	Well, I think security is a condition for exercising freedom that we want to be able
223240	226400	to exercise in a communist society.
226400	234840	So in that sense, it's also a presupposition or it's a fundamental thing about communism
234840	236120	also.
236120	244240	In the sense that only on the basis of existential security and an absence of fear of not being
244240	248240	able to sustain oneself, freedom can develop.
248240	254800	That's kind of the reason I know.
254800	261360	One of the primary aims of a communist society would be to secure unconditional access to
261360	268720	everything that people need to live a good and stable and healthy life.
268720	273560	And just as an additional follow up in terms of the definition of freedom.
273560	280720	So the way that you described it before, it was very much related to an absence of domination.
280720	288720	Are there other aspects of freedom that you would stress when it comes to this huge and
288720	292040	fundamental question of what this actually means?
292040	293040	Freedom?
293040	294040	Yes.
294040	298120	Well, I like the definition of freedom as absence of domination, but I would also and
298120	304040	I think this is maybe just another way of saying that actually that freedom is intrinsically
304040	311880	connected to democracy or is a democratic idea in the sense that human beings are by
311880	319240	nature social beings and human beings are also natural beings, a part of nature and
319240	327120	are dependent on the earth and the earth belongs to no one and therefore to everyone.
327120	334120	And that means in a sense that we are by nature political animals and that the question of
334120	340960	how human beings relate to their conditions of existence is necessarily a political question.
340960	344160	And because of that, I think that freedom is not just a question of the relationship
344160	348480	between the individual and the political community or political institutions.
348480	354520	And that would be like the modern or liberal notion of political freedom, that freedom
354520	359440	is a question of the absence of political institutions from the point of view of the
359440	360560	individual.
360560	366400	Freedom also has to consist in being able to participate in making decisions about
366400	371360	the necessarily common aspects of our lives.
371360	376640	And in that sense, I think freedom is inherently a democratic ideal.
376640	383560	And since you mentioned this logic that you apply when it comes to the question of human
383560	390280	nature or humans relation to nature, I think it would also be maybe a useful aspect to
390280	396680	point out that when it comes to this idea of freedom, as far as I understand your idea
396680	403760	of it, it does not entail a certain naturalized idea of that there was a human subject as
403760	410280	an essence that should be kind of brought into full fruition, so to speak.
410280	414920	At least that's how I understood it, that you are opposed to this notion of a naturalized
414920	420160	kind of free individual that is suppressed by the conditions that surround them.
420160	421800	Yes, that's right.
421800	427560	So one way of putting it would be to say that there is no natural in the sense of an immediately
427560	432320	given way for human beings to relate to their conditions of existence.
432320	433760	It's always a political question.
433760	436420	So it's up to us.
436420	444200	So communism is not an exercise in trying to discover the authentic natural ways for
444200	448080	human beings to relate to their conditions of existence.
448080	456440	But communism means establishing the political conditions for actually making decisions
456440	464240	about how we want to relate to our collective conditions of existence.
464240	468160	And there's no natural way of doing that.
468160	471000	It's always a political decision.
471000	475760	And there's no subject that should be liberated beneath that, right?
475760	476760	Exactly.
476760	477760	Okay.
477760	484480	So we will get to the point where we kind of dive a little bit deeper into the way you
484480	491440	imagine the set up for how communism might bring all of these things about.
491440	496660	But before we do so, I would first like to address a different layer of abstraction,
496660	501120	so to speak, which I believe to be of great importance for the way in which we think
501120	502800	about alternatives.
502800	508060	In your book, Mute Compulsion, you argue that Marx's critique is not aiming to provide
508060	512940	an alternative political economy, but that he instead criticizes the field of political
512940	520020	economy as such and the implicit assumptions and concepts that are baked into it, so to
520020	521020	speak.
521020	527580	So what are the elements and functional logics of the field of political economy that Marx
527580	532100	criticized and what does this critique mean for the way in which we think about alternatives
532100	534380	to capitalism today?
534380	541900	I think that probably the most fundamental gesture in Marx's critique of political economy
541900	543820	is to historicize.
543820	550500	So the problem with the field of political economy is, first of all, it's a historical
550500	554980	way of thinking about capitalism or about the economy.
554980	559460	So I think that's the most important shift of perspective in Marx's critique of political
559460	565180	economy and his critique of capitalism, to view the capitalist economy as a historical
565180	569660	reality, as something that came into being at a certain point in history for certain
569660	573520	historical reasons that we need to uncover and explain.
573520	580960	So another way of saying that is to say that the problem with political economy is its
580960	593360	economism, its tendency to, and that's something that you also find in mainstream economics
593360	601520	today and also, I would say, much political science, the often implicit idea that the
601520	609240	economy is a separated sphere of society governed by its own distinct forms of rationality.
609240	614360	I think Robert Brenner puts it very well, he writes somewhere that historical materialist
614360	622380	accounts of capitalism begin by denying the existence of a transhistorical economic rationality.
622380	632940	So the idea is to politicize the economy, to see the economy as consisting of social
632940	641340	relations, historically specific social relations, and therefore as a political reality, and
641340	649560	that means rejecting the conceptual separation between politics and economics, the political
649560	651640	and the economic.
651640	657260	So that's obviously also important for how we think about alternatives to capitalism,
657260	666820	because that means that there are no transhistorical economic laws, there is no such thing as
666820	671080	transhistorical economic rationality.
671080	678520	It's up to us to decide how the economy should be organized, that means it's up to us to
678520	683940	decide what should be produced and who should produce it and how it should be produced
683940	686300	and who should get the results of that production and so on.
686300	691980	All of these economic processes, all of these economic decisions are always necessarily
691980	695500	political decisions.
695500	703300	So I think that's maybe the most fundamental idea in Marx's critique of political economy.
703300	707880	Okay, let's maybe dig a little deeper into that.
707880	713920	So in your article you write that it's not, when it comes to the question of alternatives,
713920	719680	you write that following from that it's not about providing an alternative economic principle,
719680	724700	but that it's instead, and I quote, you hear about enabling democratic decision making
724700	728900	about how our shared activities and resources should be organized.
728900	734700	And I think you already mentioned some aspects that are kind of related to this question
734700	741620	when it comes to how to avoid, let's say, the mistakes of economists, so to speak.
741620	744660	But I would be interested to take a second look into this.
744660	750720	Would you say that we should kind of ditch economics altogether?
750720	758180	You stated that you need to historicize it, there are no transhistorical laws of economics,
758180	759260	so to speak.
759260	764460	But are there, let's say, some aspects maybe of the theoretical apparatus of political
764460	773580	economy or maybe a bit more narrowly economics that can sensibly be repurposed for a constructive
773580	780960	effort around alternatives, or would you argue that we should kind of ditch the discipline
780960	782800	of economics altogether?
782800	786560	That would be one part of my question and the other one would be, and this is a very
786560	793960	crucial aspect to me, in neoliberalism, the market constitutes also a site for the production
793960	795340	of truth.
795340	803440	So if we argue for overcoming the market in this function as well, I'm asking myself,
803440	812360	what could be the mechanisms, maybe in plural, to fulfill this aspect of societal organization?
812360	818360	Because this is a very, very crucial mechanism, I would say, within the way our societies
818360	826840	are governed today, and I get the sense that simply stating we will do it democratically
826840	831640	then does not kind of answer the questions sufficiently, I would say, because these
831640	839200	things operate on different levels, I would say.
839200	844680	To be honest, I'm not sure I understand why saying we will do that democratically
844680	852280	is not a good answer, because I think that the way the function of the market in capitalism
852280	861760	as one of the functions of the market in a capitalist society is coordinating production,
861760	867080	coordinating decisions of individual producing units about how much to produce and how to
867080	872120	produce things, by what productivity standards and so on.
872120	879240	That's one of the things that price signals does, and that would be replaced by planning.
879240	887000	So we would take, in a communist society, we would make democratic decisions about
887000	892840	what are we going to produce, and we would also be able, for example, to take democratic
892840	898480	decisions about production methods and productivity standards, for example.
898480	906760	So in that sense, I think my answer would simply be that we are going to replace the
906760	913200	market and market mechanisms with democratic decision processes.
913200	920400	And I'm not sure why that's not a good answer.
920400	927800	It's an absolutely great answer in general, I would say, but since I conducted quite
927800	933320	a couple of interviews on democratic planning by now with different people who develop different
933320	938080	models surrounding that, I more and more got the sense that at some point, when it comes
938080	944080	to crucial questions within these models, this is the default answer, which is kind
944080	947280	of serving as a cover-up in many ways.
947280	953560	And it's serving as a cover-up, for example, when it comes to questions of valuation
953560	961720	or evaluation, like measure, what's the way in which we kind of agree to measure, let's
961720	962720	say?
962720	969680	What do we agree on what the basis of our decision-making and evaluation is, so to speak?
969680	970680	So that's one element.
970680	977800	And the other one is that in some of the instances, there's a certain, for me, problematic
977800	983360	fallback to a certain notion of the subject, because then if you go further, you know,
983360	986400	we do it democratically, okay, fine, that's great.
986400	989880	And then what's the basis of this democratic process?
989880	992320	And then you get to the question of the subject.
992320	998560	And then in many instances, you have a kind of weird notion of the underlying subject,
998560	1004280	I would say, which is conceptualized as an autonomous, self-activating and self-governing
1004280	1011280	subject, to quote Pat Devine, who otherwise has a very, very, very great model or idea
1011280	1013560	of how to approach democratic planning.
1013560	1021720	But there you get to some kind of, it gets more complicated than just stating, okay,
1021720	1026760	we do it democratic and then it's fine, I would say, because there are certain questions
1026760	1031600	that are attached to it that still need to be answered or that might complicate the
1031600	1034960	whole thing quite a bit, I would say.
1034960	1037720	But in general, it's of course right to say so.
1037720	1043680	If we just state it very generally, then yes, absolutely, let's do democratic planning,
1043680	1046680	of course.
1046680	1054480	You're right that there are a lot of complicating factors here and it's obviously an extremely
1054560	1061720	important question you raise about how we evaluate and how we measure and are we going
1061720	1066760	to measure in hours and labor time, for example?
1066760	1072200	Some people would say no, I don't really see a problem with doing that.
1072200	1081240	But it's obviously extremely difficult, I think, to come up with a very clear answer
1081240	1085360	to how we decide on productivity standards, for example.
1085360	1091520	So if we democratically decide that we want to produce a certain amount of a certain
1091520	1099440	product and then we need to know how much time does it take to produce that.
1099440	1104560	And in order to make that calculation, we need a productivity standard.
1104560	1106480	And how do we decide on that?
1106480	1110680	Should it be the producers, for example, the people who are actually producing the product
1110680	1114360	that should decide that, decide how they want to work?
1114360	1124720	Or do we want to accept some kind of that they have to do it within certain limits,
1124720	1133960	that the broader society as such can demand a certain productivity standard from the producers?
1133960	1141760	But no matter how we answer those questions, I think it always comes back to that the
1141760	1148680	only legitimate way of doing that in a communist society would be to do some sort of
1148680	1150920	democratic decision making process.
1150920	1155440	So that's a difficult question, but it's a question we would have to find some sort
1155440	1166640	of answer to, because the alternative would be to accept the blind forces of the blind
1166640	1174320	domination of the market or something like that, or a despotic authority of some sort.
1174320	1175320	Right, right.
1175320	1179160	No, no, neither of those, for sure.
1179160	1183480	But maybe just to get an idea about the first part of the question.
1183480	1190920	How much of the corpus of political economy and economics specifically can be repurposed
1190920	1193840	in a sensible way for this constructive effort?
1193840	1198520	Because I mean, somehow one gets the sense that it's built on rotten ground.
1198520	1205080	But I mean, it is also there might still be something that can be useful.
1205080	1207240	So I would be interested in your opinion on that.
1207240	1209760	I'm not totally sure what to answer to this question.
1209760	1220440	I'm tempted to say that there's not much of worth keeping in economics, but I think
1220440	1233440	that a planned economy would require a lot of data gathering, data collecting, collecting
1233440	1238400	and managing data and also a lot of calculation.
1238400	1246520	And it might be that there are some aspects of economics that would be useful in order
1246520	1252240	to do that calculation and handling of data, but I'm not sure.
1252240	1260640	Okay, so let's kind of leave this very abstract level and get to a bit more concrete levels
1260640	1262440	of the discussion.
1262440	1268360	Your article describes some of the basic coordinates of how to organize our societies differently
1268360	1272960	in communism in order to provide freedom, security and much, much more.
1272960	1280480	Could you maybe run us through the basic coordinates of how you imagine communism to be organized?
1280480	1294400	Yes, that's a big question, but I guess the basic idea is that communism requires replacing
1294400	1304280	the market with planning and to create new political institutions that would enable
1304280	1310560	us to make democratic decisions about what to do with our common resources and to make
1310560	1317040	decisions about, economic decisions about what to produce and how to produce it and
1317040	1322720	where and when and how to distribute the results of that production.
1322720	1330560	And that's, I think, the basic coordinates, if that's what you mean.
1330560	1337240	Well, maybe, I mean, there would be the need for some types of institutions, for example.
1337240	1339000	So could you maybe go into that?
1339000	1341920	Like what kind of institutions would we need?
1341920	1345360	How would they need to be different from the institutions we have?
1345360	1349320	So maybe you could give us a sketch of this institutional setup.
1349480	1356360	Yes, I think that in order to secure the highest possible degree of freedom and security
1356360	1361960	and in order to avoid concentration of power as much as possible, it would be useful to
1361960	1372240	try to make decisions as close as possible to those who are affected by those decisions.
1372240	1381240	I think that would be an important guiding principle for creating a network of institutions
1381240	1385600	that would allow us to plan production.
1385600	1395120	So power should be decentralised as much as possible.
1395120	1402600	But of course, there are certain decisions that cannot be left to individuals or to
1402600	1409360	small local groups or something like that, especially here, I'm especially thinking
1409360	1416000	of decisions regarding use of natural resources.
1416000	1425040	So we're obviously also going to need some sort of actually a global institution for
1425040	1426560	making decisions about that.
1426560	1436800	But so I'm imagining communist political institutions as a network of several layers of
1436800	1445480	institutions that make decisions and where there's not a clear hierarchy of institutions
1445480	1449160	in the way that we're used to from the nation state as we know it.
1450520	1460080	So I think that if we use the word state to talk about what we know as the modern nation
1460080	1471080	state, then we would have to abolish the state and design and construct new political
1471120	1473120	institutions.
1473120	1479240	If we use a broader notion of the state as basically any kind of political institution,
1479240	1487280	then I would say that we need to come up with a new form of state, a new state power.
1487280	1491800	But that's not really an answer to your question, is it?
1491800	1492920	Well, that's totally fine.
1492920	1499320	If you do not have this sketch of which kinds of institutions specifically would be needed
1499480	1506280	and which kinds of tasks they would be able and necessary to perform, that's totally
1506280	1506720	all right.
1506720	1512280	I think it would be nonetheless good to kind of paint a little bit more of a picture of
1512280	1518560	how you imagine this general set up to be, because there are some other aspects that
1518560	1520600	you do define in your text.
1520600	1522320	You write about communes.
1522320	1531320	You write about that these communes should be ideally autark, more or less, even though,
1531320	1536680	as you pointed towards in your last answer as well, even though there is the need for
1536680	1539160	kind of higher level coordination as well.
1539160	1545160	But you, at least in the text state, that you think this would be an ideal structure
1545160	1548560	to have these communes to be more or less autark.
1548600	1554560	You also write about a certain amount of work that people should perform.
1554560	1560000	And I'm absolutely curious about getting to know whether or not this implies some form
1560000	1565440	of compulsion to work, which is kind of implied, but not really made explicit.
1565840	1572160	So there are other aspects to the way that you imagine this communist society to be
1572160	1574520	organized that you do have ideas about.
1574520	1577680	So maybe we could kind of get into those aspects as well.
1579560	1589760	Yes, yeah, I use the word commune as a way of talking about what would be the basic
1590520	1596120	institutional unit of communism.
1596840	1603800	And ideally, every commune would have control over everything that the commune needs in
1603800	1611240	order to secure a good and stable life for its communards, for the people who live in
1611240	1616360	that commune. And the reason why I think that's an important principle is that it would
1616800	1625720	make us less vulnerable to counterrevolutionary attempts to re-erect class society, for
1625760	1634200	example, or other forms of also forms of concentration of power or corruption, something
1634200	1642000	like that. If communes are not too dependent upon each other, then they would have
1642000	1648040	more autonomy. And that means that if if something went wrong in one commune, it wouldn't
1648040	1654760	necessarily the other communes would have a better basis for struggling against that or
1655520	1663040	trying to avoid a concentration of power or corruption or counterrevolutionary
1664320	1665320	movements and so on.
1666160	1675760	Yet at the same time, you, I think, rightfully stress that there is actually by nature, you
1675760	1679320	argue, a high level of interdependence.
1679360	1686840	You know, and I when reading about this autarky aspect of the commune, even though I
1686840	1693160	understand your argument as well, that it creates some kind of safety backup, so to
1693160	1697840	speak, when it comes to attacks and stuff like that.
1697880	1705600	But still, I was kind of a bit irritated about this falling back into this very strong
1705600	1712960	notion of autonomy, because, as I said, really like the approach of emphasizing the
1712960	1719240	interdependence. And this interdependence is also highly relevant when it comes to, like
1719240	1726200	many, many of the aspects that will have to be addressed through each and every commune
1726200	1731200	as well. You already talked about the question of resource use.
1731680	1739800	I mean, if we do want to have some kind of meta level coordination when it comes to
1739800	1744280	this question of resource use, which is kind of necessary if we want to, for example,
1744600	1752280	address climate change and excessive resource use as it is being performed right now, then
1752280	1759440	you immediately get into a situation where you will have to have functioning forms of
1760440	1764160	mediation between these different levels, so to speak.
1764160	1772640	So and there I would say I would argue this idea of autarky kind of goes against this
1772640	1778920	grain, because the level in which this interdependence and therefore
1778920	1785720	interconnection will have to be enacted is so much ingrained in each and every aspect
1785800	1791400	of, for example, the production process, that it's very hard to imagine both of these
1791400	1796880	same things at the same time, you know, this high, very high level of autonomy for each
1797240	1804800	commune and kind of organizational coordination on a meta level when it comes to, for
1804800	1809720	example, overall resource use, because these things are necessarily intertwined in a very,
1809720	1810920	very intense way.
1811360	1819560	So I was kind of struggling to imagine how highly autarky communes working next to each
1819560	1826440	other, so to speak, but not really together as a default modus operandi, so to speak,
1826440	1834040	how these autonomous communes would be able to to achieve this higher level coordination.
1834760	1839640	I think that regarding the question of interdependence, I think that there's a
1839640	1846000	fundamental difference between human individuals and political communities.
1846000	1854360	I think humans are necessarily by nature social animals that are highly dependent upon
1854360	1861680	each other. So the interdependence I speak about is the interdependence between human
1861680	1867200	individuals, which is which is one of the reasons why, as I tried to explain earlier,
1867200	1875120	that that's one of the reasons why human freedom must necessarily also consist in
1877240	1884920	being able to participate in democratic political decision making processes.
1885000	1890200	But the same point, that point about interdependence is not necessarily true of
1890200	1894360	political communities, I would say of communities of human beings.
1894680	1900400	Political communities are not necessarily dependent upon each other to the same degree.
1901920	1908280	We are dependent on each other in the way that all political communities would live on
1908280	1910520	the same planet and we would have to share that planet.
1910520	1915880	And because of that, it would be necessary to have some sort of global regulation of the
1915880	1922520	use of natural resources, for example, how it could, for example, take the form of
1922920	1929200	quotas for CO2 quotas or something like that on a global level for each commune.
1929200	1936360	And then each commune would decide how they would use that or all sorts of different
1936360	1939160	quotas for the use of natural resources.
1939160	1942280	And then it would be up to each commune to decide how to use that.
1942600	1949560	So there is certainly an interdependence there that means that some sort of cooperation
1949560	1951400	between communes would be necessary.
1951400	1965160	But I think it would be a good idea to not to have a too high degree of division of labor
1965160	1971160	between communes, for example, because interdependence and division of labor would
1971480	1979160	always be a risk, because if one commune is dependent on something that another
1979160	1984440	commune produces, then a power relationship of domination can easily arise.
1985320	1995400	So in order to secure freedom and in order to counteract tendencies to inequality
1995400	2000600	between communes and relationships of domination between communes, it would be important to
2001800	2004360	maintain a high degree of autonomy, I would say.
2005960	2012520	Because imagine, for example, that the commune you live in has decided not to produce
2013800	2020280	medicine, for example, because there's a neighbor commune that produces a lot of
2020280	2021240	medicine instead.
2021240	2026520	And there's a division of labor where you and then you exchange or whatever you produce
2026520	2029880	something else that that other commune needs.
2030840	2039480	But then if there's something like a counterrevolutionary political force or movement
2039480	2044360	in that other commune where all of the medicine you need in your commune is produced, then all
2044360	2051800	of a sudden you would have to accept what they do or accept their demands or subject
2051800	2052680	yourself to that.
2052760	2060440	So you would be vulnerable in that sense if the commune you lived in don't have the
2060440	2063240	resources to produce medicine for themselves, for example.
2063800	2066920	How big of a commune do you imagine?
2066920	2072920	So if you talk about communes as the smallest organizational unit, how big are these
2072920	2074040	communes you think about?
2074920	2076200	That's a really good question.
2076200	2080360	And I think that communes could vary very much in size.
2080440	2087880	I think one thing that's important to note here is that we would have to build
2088440	2095560	communism on the basis of whatever capitalism has left us with, which means, for example,
2095560	2102360	that we would have to build communism also in enormous urban areas with 20 million
2102360	2103400	people, for example.
2103480	2112360	So I would imagine, for example, that we would break up cities like Tokyo or Shanghai
2112360	2115640	or New York into several communes.
2116520	2122040	And one of the problems with an urban commune would be that it would be unable to produce
2122040	2123080	its own food.
2124040	2131560	So it would be a good idea, for example, to have communes that would extend from an urban
2132040	2139880	area into a rural area in order to be able to produce everything the commune needs.
2139880	2150840	But I imagine that communes in heavily urbanized areas would maybe have up to one or two
2150840	2153640	million inhabitants or communists.
2153640	2160840	But I also imagine that in other places, in very desolate areas with very few people,
2160840	2171800	we could have quite large, in terms of area, large communes with maybe only 50,000
2171800	2173800	inhabitants or something like that.
2173800	2183000	And there are so many different reasons why to draw the borders between communes.
2183080	2189960	It could also be, for example, natural, like the landscape, the landscape could also be
2189960	2196120	reasons for drawing borders between communes, mountains or rivers or things like that.
2196120	2206840	So I think that we would, that the communes could very, very much incise from, for example,
2206840	2218040	maybe from a few thousand people to millions of people.
2219880	2225880	I think we kind of then circle back to this question of interdependence again, because
2225880	2233960	I mean, for many things, I mean, if you want to build a computer, you will have to have
2233960	2242760	minerals, many materials, knowledge, so many things that not every like two or five
2242760	2246360	thousand people commune will be able to provide, obviously.
2246360	2252120	So again, we are back to this question of interdependence and kind of impossibility
2252120	2257400	of total autarky when it comes to many, many things, you know, infrastructural things
2257400	2265400	like train connections that span, in this case, many communes for sure, because we would
2265400	2271720	not want to kind of just get to the border of my commune and then have to change into
2271720	2274360	another form of transportation, so to speak.
2274360	2280920	So I mean, these are all, of course, questions that kind of pop up in this very atomized
2282200	2283480	way of thinking about it.
2283560	2290280	And if that would be a too big a problem, then I guess communes could decide to make
2290280	2297240	one larger commune, like to fusion, is that the word, into a larger commune.
2297240	2301320	Or they would maybe just accept that there are certain things that they are unable to
2301320	2307000	produce. And because in such a situation people would be able to move freely between
2307000	2312040	communes, then, you know, it would maybe also, we should maybe also think of that as a
2312040	2316760	situation where there would be many different kinds of communes with many different forms
2316760	2325400	of life and that maybe some people would prefer, you know, one way of living in a
2325400	2332520	rural commune where you wouldn't have to work that much, but there would also be certain
2332520	2336280	things that you wouldn't be able to have there.
2336280	2340280	But you would always be able to move to another commune if you wanted to do that.
2340360	2345480	Or the commune could also just, you know, it would be up to each commune to decide
2348440	2358200	how much to depend on other communes or make agreements with other communes about
2358200	2360200	exchanging things or whatever.
2360200	2365400	Okay, maybe let's then dig a little deeper into this, because you just now mentioned
2365400	2370840	exchange, so let's dig a little deeper into the planning process, because you do sketch
2370840	2372840	some ideas within your text.
2373640	2379240	Could you maybe run us through how you imagine a planning mechanism to go about?
2379960	2389560	Yes, well, I think the first step is that we would have to make decisions about what we're
2389560	2392840	going to take collective responsibility for producing.
2392840	2400920	So, decisions about what to produce would have to be taken democratically in our political
2400920	2402920	institutions in the commune.
2402920	2412200	And then, and I imagine that that would, could, for example, take the form of different groups
2412200	2418760	or organizations or that could submit proposals and that there would be some sort of, you
2418760	2428920	know, public debate about that or, and then maybe several rounds of voting for those
2428920	2435000	different plans, which would be plans for maybe a couple of years, let's say two years,
2435000	2437000	for example.
2437000	2443880	So, every second year we would vote for a new plan and that plan would basically be a
2444840	2450840	proposal for what to take collective responsibility for producing.
2450840	2453880	So, what to do with our common resources.
2453880	2461880	And then through that political process, we would end up with a production plan and that
2461880	2472360	would then have to be implemented and that could be translated to a certain amount of
2472360	2479080	working hours, total working hours that would be distributed as a rule evenly among everyone.
2479080	2485480	So, that's like the way I think about that in very broad terms.
2485480	2488360	And would there then be a compulsion to work?
2488360	2491000	We touched upon this, but didn't yet answer it.
2491000	2502200	That's a good question and I think that I would love to be able to say no and that there would
2502200	2511480	never be any form of, that in communism everyone would be able to do whatever they want
2511480	2519720	all the time and that there would be no one forcing you to do anything, but I'm not sure.
2519720	2523240	I think that's a realistic thing to say.
2523320	2534200	So, it's a realistic scenario that some people might not live up to their duties all the time
2534200	2545240	and I think that we would then have to discuss to what degree we would accept that
2545240	2551400	because I could also imagine that it would also be possible just to calculate with that
2551400	2561800	in a sense that there's a certain amount of people that wouldn't show up for work or
2561800	2569400	something like that and maybe we could just accept that, but if it turns out that it has
2570040	2576520	too many negative consequences in the long run, I think there would probably need to be
2576520	2584840	some sort of, I'm not sure compulsion to work is the right way to describe it, but
2585640	2594440	I could imagine, for example, that you could lose certain privileges if you don't take your
2594440	2601560	share of collective responsibilities. I think that it's really important to, as I said earlier,
2601640	2608520	to guarantee unconditional access to everything that people need to live a
2610520	2618840	good, healthy, stable life, so unconditional access to housing and food, medicine,
2619880	2627080	healthcare and so on, but imagine, for example, that we have collectively decided that everyone
2627720	2636200	has the right to take a new education every 10 years, for example, then maybe that's a
2636760	2644680	right that you could lose or imagine that there are waiting lists for certain, especially
2644680	2650840	attractive housing, something like that, and then maybe if you don't show up for work,
2651800	2657720	then you will lose your place on the waiting list for a housing or something like that.
2657720	2666200	So there could be certain things that I'm not sure I would categorize that as or call that
2666200	2675400	compulsion to work. Does that make sense? Yeah, kind of. I mean, I think for me the thing is that
2675400	2681560	I would say that you end up with this dilemma, because I can sense that it's a dilemma for you
2681560	2688920	as well, somehow it feels like it. And I think you end up with this dilemma because of this
2689560	2694280	separation that you introduced, the separation between the realm of necessity and the realm
2694280	2701000	of freedom. So maybe let's talk about that, because I think this is the source for why you then come
2701000	2707240	to a point where you have this situation where you think that you need to discipline or incentivize,
2707240	2716280	which is kind of a form of disciplining in a different way, so to speak. That's why you end
2716280	2722360	up with this constellation where you think that you need to discipline people into doing certain
2722440	2731960	types of work in order to use this remuneration or withholding of remuneration or benefits in
2731960	2738760	order to steer, so to speak, the way in which things are being organized. So I think this is
2738760	2743240	the root of it. So maybe let's talk about it. Could you maybe describe these different realms
2743240	2748120	to us and why you believe this to be a sensible distinction? Well, it's a distinction
2748120	2761240	that Marx makes, and I refer to Aaron Benenow when I mentioned it in the essay, but I'm not sure
2761240	2768360	it's the best way to describe actually what I'm trying to describe there. So the idea is that
2768360	2775080	there are certain needs that we agree politically to take collective responsibility for,
2775080	2783080	and that's the public production. That would be what the commune decides to produce,
2783080	2787320	what we decide together to produce in the commune, and to take responsibility for.
2789320	2795560	So that's what we could call the realm of necessity, if we want to use that notion,
2795560	2806520	because it's what we agree is necessary labor, necessary production. So it would obviously be,
2806520	2813480	for example, production of food for everyone, production of medicine and housing and things
2813480	2821080	like that. But there are a lot of things that would quite obviously be necessary for
2821160	2826760	the commune to exist, and we would have to take care of that collectively. But then there are all
2826760	2833400	sorts of products that we would not necessarily regard as a public responsibility to take care of.
2834360	2841240	Maybe some people would suggest that we should build a piano factory,
2841240	2847400	because we want to have pianos. But other people might have the opinion that, well,
2847400	2855000	I would rather work less, because everything we would decide to produce would mean more work
2855000	2861160	for everyone, because we would distribute work evenly. So everything we add to the list of what
2861160	2869320	the commune produces would mean more work for everyone, because we would distribute work evenly.
2869480	2879960	So it would always be a discussion about or a decision about what do we want to
2880520	2885880	have more, less work, or do we want to have this or that product.
2886600	2891240	And then we would disagree on that. So maybe some people would vote for a production plan that
2891240	2897000	would include pianos and accept that everyone would have to work a little bit more, because
2897640	2902600	we think it's nice to have pianos. And other people would maybe prefer not to work and then
2902600	2910360	not to have pianos. And then whatever the result would be, the commune would not necessarily
2910360	2919000	produce everything that people want. So there will be a lot of needs that will not be met,
2919000	2925080	or a lot of wants that will not be met by the production that is organized by the commune.
2925080	2931880	And what are we going to do about that? Well, it's obvious, I think, to say that people
2931880	2938360	would be, if they can, they would be free to produce that in their free time outside of the
2938360	2947800	work organized by the commune. So that's kind of like the basis for distinguishing between
2948760	2953400	the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom. The realm of necessity is the
2955480	2961560	all of the things we agree are necessary to produce together and that we take collective
2961560	2969000	responsibility for producing. And as a political community and the realm of freedom is whatever we
2969000	2979080	want to use all of us, all of the rest of our time, whatever we want to use that for. And it's
2979080	2983400	important here to know that the realm of freedom would be much larger in
2984920	2989240	counting in hours and we would have more free time.
2992280	3003400	Yeah. I want to add that I'm not sure that those terms, the realm of necessity and the realm of
3003400	3009240	freedom are the best way to describe that. And maybe that's what some of what you were
3009240	3015960	thinking about when you asked me about this, that I just said earlier that organizing
3017720	3022920	the economy by means of democratic decision making would be the best thing to do with
3022920	3032120	one society with as high a degree of freedom as possible. So in a sense that is wrong to oppose
3034040	3040840	that to freedom. Right. Absolutely. I would agree with that with the last statement. That's why
3040840	3046520	I think it's an unlucky separation because for me when reading the text I always thought,
3046520	3053560	what? Wait a second. What you're describing as the realm of necessity is the realm of freedom
3053560	3062760	since it produces freedom as such. And also through this separation of realm of
3062760	3067400	necessity and realm of freedom, you get into a position where you kind of reproduce
3067400	3076600	a certain notion of labor, not only work, but labor, meaning that something that I do not want to do,
3076600	3081800	but have to do. And this has all kinds of consequences in terms of motivation, in terms of
3082600	3089560	effectiveness and stuff like that. So I would argue that one would need to approach
3090040	3094680	what you call the realm of necessity also from a perspective through which
3095640	3102280	what you have to do in order to reproduce is not just a kind of labor you have to do because you
3102280	3111000	are being forced to, but is also a part of a perspective that sees this work as absolutely,
3111640	3116600	I wanted to say logic, but that's maybe the wrong word, as a necessary part of reproduction
3117320	3123320	that is not separated into a kind of alienating thing to do, so to speak,
3124680	3132600	maybe to be a bit polemic about it, I would say. So I'm kind of against these different splits.
3132600	3142120	I can definitely see why you're against that. I think maybe it's good to remind ourselves
3142120	3148040	why Marx uses these words. And I think it's because when he talks about realm of necessity,
3148040	3154280	I think he's talking about a kind of natural necessity here, the fact that human beings are
3155160	3163000	forced to work if we want to live. And I think Marx is right in that one of the fundamental
3163000	3168120	aspects of human beings is, and he says this already in his early writings in the German
3168120	3172600	Ideologie, that what distinguishes human beings from other animals is that they produce,
3172600	3179080	that we are forced to transform our surroundings in order to be able to live of them. So
3179080	3185080	human beings, we have to work in order to live. We have to transform our surroundings in order
3185080	3191320	to be able to live off those surroundings. And that is a natural necessity. And that's why
3192040	3199960	he calls it the realm of necessity, right? And then the more productive we can get,
3199960	3207720	the less time we need to do that, or also depending on the natural conditions of where we live.
3209000	3214920	If you live in certain areas, certain places on the earth, it would require more work to
3215880	3220840	to be able to survive than in other places. But the basic fact is that there is a certain
3220840	3227320	amount of work that is necessary in order to live. And that's a natural necessity. And that's why
3227320	3233240	Marx calls it the realm of necessity. And in opposition to that, the rest of your time you
3233240	3242120	can use to do whatever you want. And that's the realm of freedom. So I think maybe the reason why,
3243080	3250520	or the source of confusion or disagreement here is maybe that we're maybe confusing
3251080	3258120	a natural necessity and freedom with political necessity and political freedom,
3258120	3263800	if that makes sense. Yeah, kind of. But also, I think the way that you use the realm of necessity
3263800	3270680	is not the way that you described it right now. So it's not the Marxian notion of subsistence. So
3270680	3277480	the basic level of what you have to do in order to reproduce yourself as a physical,
3278360	3285400	biological object, so to speak. So you use it in a very different way, which is encompassing
3285960	3292280	much more than just subsistence. And then, and I think this kind of complicates this as well,
3292280	3298920	you use these words private sector and public sector. So you use public sector for the realm
3298920	3304440	of necessity and then private sector for the realm of freedom, so to speak. And I mean,
3304440	3313160	this also adds another layer of confusion in that it kind of runs the danger of sounding as if you
3313160	3320360	wanted to say that the private sector, in which you also state that there will possibly still be
3320360	3326120	markets, exchange, et cetera, that this is the realm of freedom. And it quickly sounds
3326760	3333800	like this liberal talking point where markets are equated with freedom and planning is
3333800	3339320	basically tyranny and obligation, so to speak, which is definitely not what you wanted to state.
3339320	3344840	And it is absolutely clear reading the text that this is not what you wanted to say. But
3344840	3351720	I just think that this terminology, this additional terminology of public sector and
3351720	3357640	private sector also kind of feeds into the misunderstanding, I would say. Yeah.
3358680	3361960	Yeah, I think you're right about that. And there's obviously
3364360	3370360	a risk that, well, because public and private sector are concepts that we also use about
3371880	3379880	the capitalist economy, then there's a risk of thinking that what I'm describing
3379880	3383880	there would be something that's similar to how the capitalist economy works, which is
3383880	3391320	not what I'm trying to do, but not what I'm trying to say there. So I'm open to suggestions
3391320	3398280	for a better way of making this distinction, because I think it is an important distinction
3398280	3405480	to make. And so in a communist mode of production, we would make democratic decisions
3405480	3410440	about what to produce. But what about all the things that we would decide not to produce?
3411000	3420120	I mean, I could see myself voting for a production plan that would mean that a lot of things that
3420120	3425480	some people would like to have would not be produced. And what do we say to those people who
3425480	3432440	would then would like to have those products? I mean, the thing in capitalism is that Marx puts
3432440	3440520	it somewhere in capital that money is basically a technology for transforming
3440520	3445720	a social power into the power of the individual, something like that. He says something about
3445720	3451800	carrying social power in your pocket or something like that. Because what you can do in capitalism
3451800	3457640	is that if you have money, then you can basically decide what will happen to some of our
3457640	3466360	collective resources. Because demand on the market is what determines what gets produced,
3466360	3477560	right? And that power of the individual in capitalism, that money allows you as an
3477560	3483480	individual to decide what gets produced. You wouldn't have that in a communist society,
3483480	3490360	because that's the problem with capitalism, that it's people who have money who decide.
3491720	3498040	So we would replace that with collective democratic decision making. And that would mean
3498040	3501880	that there would be a lot of things that we would maybe not take collective responsibility
3501880	3506600	for producing. And what do we do about that? I think it's not a good answer to say, well,
3506600	3514280	people just have to accept that we're not going to produce pianos or other things that some
3514280	3524040	people would maybe think would be luxury products. And I think it's better to say that people would
3524040	3530040	have the possibility of producing that in their free time. And they could also find other people
3530040	3535160	who would also like pianos and produce pianos together and then make some kind of private
3535160	3542040	piano producing factory, if that's what they want. I mean, why shouldn't they not be able to
3542040	3546680	that? Why should we ban that? And of course, that would require some resources, because you need a
3546680	3551080	lot of things in order to build pianos. And where would you get those resources from? You would
3551080	3555080	obviously have to get them from the commune. So again, the commune would have to make decisions
3555080	3561400	about which resources to give to private production. But I think it's important to
3562360	3569960	acknowledge that if we are going to have a democratically planned economy, there would be a
3569960	3574920	lot of things that would not get produced, a lot of needs that would not be met by
3575800	3581960	our collective production. And we would have to find a way of letting people
3583240	3590360	having those needs met in other ways. So that's a way of saying that there
3590360	3596760	would be production also outside of what the commune organizes. The production organized
3596760	3604040	by the commune would not be all production that there is in society. So we need some sort of
3604040	3609320	distinction there. We need a concept to distinguish between those two forms of production.
3610120	3615160	Yeah, I mean, there are different questions attached to that. If you say that what you call
3615240	3621160	the private sector will need to get some forms of resources, I think then you'll quickly get to
3621160	3629640	the point where one might say, okay, why then not just include this as a need into the collective
3629640	3638200	process? Why funnel these resources into a market system, so to speak, in order to be able to
3638200	3646120	produce piano? So we can have mechanisms that allow for the detection of needs that are not yet
3646120	3654040	met. We can develop mechanisms that are able to provide some form of plus X that might be some
3654040	3658840	form of luxury goods. So there should be some mechanisms. I absolutely agree with you. There
3658840	3666120	should be some mechanisms in place that are able to kind of address these extra needs, so to speak.
3666120	3672520	I'm not quite sure whether this automatically implies that you will have to have a form of
3672520	3680600	classical market system, you know, with some form of money, some form of value form and all the
3680600	3686360	things that go along with this, because at least to me it sounded as if what you describe as a
3686360	3693640	private sector would then probably have all of these things in order to be able to produce
3693640	3703320	this plus X. And my argument would be there can be creative ways of integrating this absolutely
3703320	3712600	valid need for the plus X into forms of democratic planning as well. So it's not about a rigid system
3712600	3720840	that does not have any ability to change, to include, to have realms of freedom within
3721720	3727320	what we consider the collective mechanism, I would argue. And also just as a note,
3727320	3731320	it might be interesting for you to take a look at David Leibman's model of multi-level
3731320	3737880	democratic iterative coordination, because he does have some kind of setup similar to that,
3737880	3745320	because he imagines a core sector which is run through this mechanism, the MDIC mechanism,
3745320	3750120	and then he imagines that there will be some form of kind of peripheral sector,
3751160	3759080	which will have probably some market mechanisms as well, but which might bit by bit also be
3759080	3766840	integrated over time into the MDIC system. So just as a note. But we do not have that much
3766840	3774280	time left and I have so many questions left. So I would have to pick and choose. I mean, maybe
3775320	3780760	before we get to the final question that I ask all of my guests, maybe let's get back to this
3780760	3787560	very high level of abstraction that you, I think, very brilliantly look at in your book Mute
3787560	3793800	Compulsion, because there you describe the fact that capitalism, in order to reproduce itself,
3793800	3800920	it does not only rely on ideology and violence, but also on mute compulsion or what you call
3801480	3809160	economic power. So I'm quite interested in the question, which kind of alternatives
3809160	3815400	a communism would have to provide in order to address these different fields that now
3816360	3822280	guarantee the reproduction of capitalism. So to frame it a bit more clearly, hopefully,
3822360	3832120	what kinds of mechanisms of reproduction of reproducing itself would communism need to have
3832120	3840200	in order to produce this stability and yeah, in order to reproduce itself maybe,
3840200	3848360	because I think we could go one by one through violence, ideology and economic power and ask
3848360	3856360	ourselves, okay, now this is in capitalism, this is handled through these three powers,
3856360	3861560	so to speak, but which kinds of powers would communism need to have in order to reproduce
3861560	3872040	itself? Well, I think that there would not be something similar to violence in communism,
3872040	3877000	because I mean, capitalism relies on violence, especially the violence of the state.
3878520	3887960	Without a state that guarantees private property, for example, through the use of violence in the
3887960	3894280	form of police and military, capitalism would not be possible. So in capitalism we have a
3894280	3899400	situation where the economic system is dependent upon the constant use of violence or the threat
3900200	3908120	of violence for reproducing itself. That would not be necessary in a communist society, but
3908120	3911960	that does not mean that I don't think that there would be any form of violence in
3912600	3918760	communism. I think there would still be all sorts of aggression between people and we would
3918760	3925000	have to find a way to take care of that and that would probably mean also that we would have to
3925000	3932520	accept that the commune would be able to use violence towards individual people in order to
3932520	3937560	force them to stop doing something like beating someone else, for example.
3938440	3947800	Private relationships or violence in that way, but that is not the same as violence as an
3947800	3956280	integrated element in the economic system. There wouldn't be anything similar to that in
3957800	3966280	communism. Regarding the question of ideology, I think that's very different. Your question
3966280	3977080	reminds me of a quote by Louis Althusser in his essay about Marxism and Humanism,
3978360	3986600	which I really like. There's a passage about ideology where he speaks about what is the role
3986600	3992600	of ideology and would there be any kind of ideology in a communist society, in a classless society?
3993240	3997240	I think he has a very nice way of putting that, so I'm just going to read that quote
3997240	4003960	because I just found it. He writes that, and I quote, in a class society ideology is the
4003960	4009960	relay whereby and the element in which the relation between men and their condition of existence
4009960	4017080	is settled to the profit of the ruling class. In a classless society ideology is the relay whereby
4017080	4021400	and the element in which the relation between men and their conditions of existence is lived to the
4021400	4033400	profit of all men. So I think that ideology is in a sense, ideology is something that will always
4033400	4039720	exist. The thing is that ideology is, and he's using a broad notion of ideology here because
4039720	4045720	this implies that ideology is not necessarily always a form of domination. It can also be
4046280	4052760	a concept that merely describes how
4056520	4062040	the way we understand ourselves and our surroundings are affected by our social world
4062040	4069640	and that can also contribute to reproducing social forms that are not domination or
4069640	4078040	hierarchies or something like that. So in a class society and in capitalism ideology has the
4078040	4085640	function of reproducing class society, reproducing capitalism, but we could definitely imagine that
4085640	4090200	in a communist society there would be ideological forms that would
4092600	4098600	help reproducing a free society and avoid re-erecting class society.
4099640	4104040	And then there's the question of whether there would be something similar to
4104840	4113080	economic power in communism. And I think that when I talk about economic power in capitalism
4113080	4119320	it's always a form of domination. And in that sense the whole point of
4119320	4125480	abolishing capitalism and building communism is to get rid of domination. But economic power
4125480	4130440	reveals something about a unique capacity that human beings have to organize.
4131560	4138600	We can organize our material surroundings in a way that helps to reproduce certain social
4138600	4145240	relations. In capitalism those social relations are relations of domination. But it's possible to
4145240	4152760	think about how in a communist society we could organize our material surroundings in a way that
4152760	4161880	could help reproduce communism. Or we could think about how could we organize our
4163320	4171080	material conditions of existence in a way that counteracts tendencies towards domination or
4171080	4178600	concentration of power, for example. That could be, for example, as we talked about, ensuring a high
4178600	4187000	degree of local autonomy or autonomy in each commune by giving priority to that above,
4187000	4193720	for example, productivity and division of labor. Because a high degree of division of labor would
4193720	4199480	maybe mean higher productivity, less working hours for everyone, less work for everyone.
4199480	4205560	But it could also have the consequence that it would make society more vulnerable to power
4205560	4209640	concentration. So there would be a trade-off and we would have to make some
4210600	4219160	sort of decision about that. So in that sense, if we think of economic power in a broader way as
4219800	4225400	externalizing social relations in our material conditions of existence or material and social
4225400	4231960	surroundings, then there would be something similar to that. We could think of using that
4231960	4241720	capacity, that unique capacity of human beings to work for communist ends in communism.
4241720	4246280	And then, Sören, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests and it is,
4246280	4249000	if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
4251000	4254920	It makes me joyful to imagine how daily life could be under communism,
4255800	4261720	to imagine, to work much less and also to imagine that we could have a totally different way of
4261720	4268120	organizing the division of labor, where maybe I wouldn't just have one function or one job
4269000	4277880	my entire life. Maybe I could have more than one function at the same time. So one day a week I
4277880	4283320	could do one thing and then another day in the week I could do something else. And I would maybe have
4283320	4289160	the opportunity to specialize in something new after a couple of years or do that throughout
4289160	4301720	my life. And then, of course, it makes me joyful to imagine not to never have to be worried about
4303000	4314920	money and to know that I would have a secure basis of existence, that I would have a place to live
4314920	4321320	and something to eat and everything that I would need in order to have a good life without
4322360	4327960	having to worry about how the economy is developing and what will happen in the next crisis
4327960	4332360	and whether I will lose my job and will I be able to pay my rent and
4332920	4336520	stuff like that. That makes me very joyful to think about.
