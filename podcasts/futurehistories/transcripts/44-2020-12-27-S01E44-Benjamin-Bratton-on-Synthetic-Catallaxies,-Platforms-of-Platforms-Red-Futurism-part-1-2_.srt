00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and today's episode is a very special episode.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Not only is it the last one of the year 2020, but it also is a new Future Histories live episode.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This time, Mattia Paganelli invited me to hold a guest lecture at his seminar on computational arts

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
at the Goldsmiths College in London, which I of course happily accepted.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And since the guest lecture was three hours long, I proposed a format in which I would hold a short presentation

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
on podcasting as a form of extended research and then afterwards record an episode of Future Histories live in front of the students.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm absolutely thrilled that Benjamin Bratton agreed to be the interviewee for this Future Histories live episode.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will introduce him at the beginning of the interview and so I will restrain myself to saying that

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
for me, Benjamin is one of the most interesting thinkers of our time.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
His book, The Stack, is rich beyond belief and his work tries to bridge a gap that absolutely needs to be worked at

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and that is the bridge between political theory and the techno-social realities and possibilities of our time.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My warmest thanks go out to Mattia for the invitation to hold the guest lecture,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to Benjamin for taking part in the interview and the discussion afterwards,

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and to the students of the seminar on computational arts for their participation.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We talked quite a bit and so I split the interview into two parts,

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
of which you will hear the first one today and the second one in two weeks' time.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This will be in 2021, which leads me to wishing all of you a happy new year.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you for your interest in Future Histories, your thoughts, mails, tweets, your suggestions for guests and topics.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I know 2020 has been shitty, but there are good things too and I thank you all for that.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But now, enjoy today's episode of Future Histories with the great Benjamin Bratton

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
on Synthetic Catalyxies, Platforms of Platforms and Red Futurism.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, welcome to Future Histories.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My name is Jan GroÃŸ and I am very excited to welcome Benjamin Bratton as a guest in today's episode.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Benjamin is Professor of Visual Arts and Director of the Center for Design and Geopolitics

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
at the University of California, San Diego,

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
as well as Program Director of the Terraforming Program at the Strelka Institute in Moscow.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Welcome, Benjamin.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Thank you very much for having me. Pleasure to be here.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There are multiple episodes of Future Histories that are, in one way or another,

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
concerned with the topic of cybernetic plant economies in the age of their technical feasibility.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You have talked and written about this topic and you introduced a term that might be helpful

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to understand what we are dealing with, synthetic catalyxy.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What are synthetic catalyxies and what openings do they possibly provide?

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So, yes, thank you for the invitation to speak with you.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This term, synthetic catalyxy, is probably a good place to start.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
On this question of a planned economy versus an unplanned economy,

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and maybe as a way of also perhaps beginning the conversation with some consideration of what we mean by a plan,

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
what we mean by unplanned, and maybe even what we mean by economy in this way.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So the term, the catalyxy originally, the reference that I'm drawing this from is in reference to the work of Hayek,

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,000
who uses this term catalyxy as part of his argument against socialist planned economies

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and the mid-20th century model of a socialist planned economy, which we should be clear right away.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When we're thinking about what a planned economy might be for the 21st century,

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the models of a planned economy from the mid-20th century may not necessarily be the model reference that we should be building on.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But suffice to say, for Hayek, he sees markets themselves,

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and it should be maybe clear not necessarily capitalism as a whole, but markets, at least in theory,

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
as not only a space or a place by which supply and demand might meet each other,

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but also as a kind of calculation machine, as a kind of collaborative calculation machine

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that has capacities both for feats of tremendous abstraction,

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but also for the sort of direct fulfillment of supply and demand in the simplest sense.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But the catalyxy then refers to this capacity of markets to be pricing mechanisms,

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that markets find prices, that how much the bananas should cost or how many desks and chairs should be produced

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is in essence calculated itself through the dynamics of the market.

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so it's an understanding of the market as a kind of, not just something about which computation might be interested

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
or something about which computation might be used to organize, but that the market itself has computational capacities,

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that it is a kind of computational apparatus.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now, as I'm sure you are quite aware because of all of the other, the discussions that you've kind of had,

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
he's proposing this in contradistinction to the classical socialist pricing problem,

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
which argues that no planned economy can possibly provide that calculative function that a market does

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
as quickly or as efficiently as the market can itself.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And you might imagine it sort of like if you have 10 people sitting in a room

61
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and they want to have a conversation with each other and negotiate something,

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
like how should we rearrange the furniture in this room?

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And in order for the furniture in the room to be reorganized,

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
all those 10 people would have to, let's say, write down their interest on a piece of paper

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and then send it to the office across the street.

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And then the office across the street will get all of these pieces of paper

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and then send pieces of paper back to every one of these 10 people one by one.

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And you imagine what this conversation would be like if every time anybody needed to say anything,

69
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you have to send what you wanted to say across the street to an office who then makes this plan

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and then sends it back to you.

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You would say, well, it would be just simpler if we just let, we had the conversation ourselves.

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So in any event, I'm not an Austrian, this isn't my approach,

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but just to give a sense of what the idea comes from.

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, one of the points that was made, and I'm sure you've raised this in some of your other podcasts,

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
even back in the 60s and 70s was that, well, fine,

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but the capacity for computation and particular network computation,

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
artificial computation, not the natural, let's say the natural computation of the market,

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
but the artificial computation that when we think of computers and computer networks,

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you know, silicon-based computation, to send and receive information from one point to another point,

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they already sort of understood that this was increasingly fast

81
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and again, sort of in the height of the Cold War, 60s and 70s here,

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and the capacity of synthetic calculation through silicon-based computation

83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
was also becoming increasingly fast.

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And so this argument, and then even the metaphor that I'm using of the piece of paper

85
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
walking across the street and stuff, this kind of bureaucratic model of,

86
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
this particular kind of bureaucratic model of a planned economy,

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
was probably out of date to a great extent.

88
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And that the scenario people would ask is like, okay, but what if you could,

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
what if those messages of interest that everyone had in that rearrangement of the furniture

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
could be said essentially instantaneously across the street,

91
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that it could be mapped against a thousand different ideal models of furniture rearrangement

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and then instantaneously sent back.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Would not this allow for actually an acceleration in the capacity for that conversation

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and that negotiation to take place in such a way that this would work?

95
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And that not only could artificial computation operate to produce things like pricing signals

96
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and structure models that was equally fast to the kind of emergent processes of the market,

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
but perhaps even faster, and perhaps could draw upon models and again, best practices

98
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and other kinds of things and goals and larger sort of macro programs

99
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that would not be available to just a small group of people doing this negotiation.

100
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so this became, as you've all been discussing,

101
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the basis of sort of the first wave of an interest in a kind of socialist cybernetics economics

102
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that ended up, you know, was animated the work of, you know, people like to refer to Stafford Beer,

103
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but also, you know, even in others, in certain sense, even across the political spectrum,

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
but certainly gave the rise to a kind of a different kind of idea of the mixture

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
between computation, socialism, and the planned economy here as well.

106
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So the term synthetic catalacticy that I use, that I mentioned in the book, The Stack,

107
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
going now back to your original question, is a term that would refer to that process

108
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
by which the natural capacity for a market to find price signals, for example,

109
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
or to organize the relations between its negotiated participants

110
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
could produce this kind of what the Austrian school and its descendants like to think of

111
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
as a kind of spontaneous order, could produce this process of a spontaneous order at a great distance

112
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and could do so at a scale, by using very large-scale computational systems,

113
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
planetary-scale computational systems, that that spontaneous order could be produced at a scale

114
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that would be otherwise impossible to do just through the incremental aggregation

115
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
of lots and lots of different supply and demand signals,

116
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
could do so with a speed that would be impossible otherwise, and in principle could do so

117
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
with a capacity for reflexive collective reason that would be impossible otherwise,

118
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and would be able to do so with some degree of recursive piloting or planning,

119
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and this is where the cybernetic comes in, the kind of piloting function of the whole dynamic

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
in ways that would be impossible to happen just spontaneously.

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now, as you are all probably aware, Hayek sort of pooh-poohed this whole idea,

122
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and indeed it was some of the Chicago school boys who were enthusiastic about the coup in Chile in 1973

123
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that moved Allende and Stafford Beer's CyberSign project out of the way,

124
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
who later ended up becoming quite interested in the idea of the capacity for computational systems

125
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to have these kinds of recursive market effects.

126
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And so the last point I'll make before we move on from this with this and also to maybe introduce,

127
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
frame part of our discussion around the planned economy in relationship to socialism and capitalism per se,

128
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
is that perhaps one of the historical ironies of all of this is that we do have planned economies today.

129
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We do have large-scale synthetic catalaxies in the scale that I'm describing,

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
in that this is how Walmart works, this is how Amazon works,

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
this is how Google works in terms of its pricing of words and semantics and page views and the rest of this as well,

132
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is that many of the large capitalist platforms that increasingly, in a de facto basis,

133
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
have taken on many of the roles that had previously been assigned to states,

134
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:24,000
themselves are in ways that would absolutely be recognized as such in the high X era of the 60s and 70s, planned economies.

135
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And they work because they are planned economies.

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They work because they are able to calculate prices by integrating signals

137
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with a speed and scale and complexity that would be impossible to do otherwise,

138
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
which allows them to do long-term planning, long-term recursive investment,

139
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
infrastructural investment and so forth and so on, all the things that the socialist cyberneticians were interested in,

140
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
in ways that they too would recognize as basically, yes, that's what we meant.

141
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And this, again, is kind of the irony, that you can imagine plucking some of the socialist cybernetician economists from the mid-60s

142
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and explaining to them how Amazon works, this very, very large scale global network that doesn't actually produce anything,

143
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
but matches buyers and sellers and is this massive logistical enterprise,

144
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but whose real function as a social economy is the production, is the calculation and the computational calculation of a price

145
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and then the logistical mechanism for the deliverance of this, yes, yes, yes, that's exactly what we mean.

146
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And this is also then I think part of where maybe the interest discussion is that some of the more conventional Cold War left-right distinctions

147
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
of what is planned, what's not planned, what's centralized, what's decentralized

148
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
don't line up real well when we actually sort of investigate these processes that we're talking about

149
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
as technical systems and as institutional systems.

150
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So in any event, that's my long answer to your simple question about what is synthetic catalectics.

151
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That means we do indeed have synthetic catalectics, even though these are up until today capitalist ones.

152
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I am very much interested in the possibilities of synthetic catalectics to come.

153
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I would like to build a bridge actually between a proposal by one of my other guests, Daniel E. Seros,

154
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and your analysis of what you have called platform of platforms.

155
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And you actually described Amazon as such a platform already.

156
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I think what Dan Seros describes in his book Information Technology and Socialist Construction

157
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
indeed is a different kind of proposal for a platform of platforms.

158
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And I think it absolutely confirms an intuition you have articulated in the stack about how governance,

159
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
namely planning and programming, and I quote here, may be situated at if not originate from the interface layer.

160
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There's a lot to unpack here. Let's do this step by step and start with a definition of platforms.

161
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What are platforms and what could a platform of platforms that is different from those that we already have look like?

162
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, it could look like it could look lots of things.

163
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The platform, as I model it in the stack and discuss it in the stack,

164
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't mean it in a way to sort of evangelize platforms or to argue that platforms are in themselves good or bad or whatever,

165
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but rather to try to make the argument on behalf of, you know,

166
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
for a kind of future old political science or economics or indeed international relations or computer science

167
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and most likely the way in which those approaches would need to kind of converge and understand each other a bit more,

168
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
particularly the computer science and political science.

169
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
To understand platforms not just as a kind of technical arrangement, but as an institutional form as well

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and one that has logics that are different than states, that are different than markets,

171
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
that their political structure is different and indeed their economic structure is different.

172
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So whereas a platform in the simplest sense can be understood as a kind of a set of generic,

173
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
a kind of a set of generic schematic arrangements that allows for the organization

174
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
of other forms of conditional participation within that schema to interoperate with one another

175
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
in ways that wouldn't have been possible without their participation within that platform.

176
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And so the platform in this way has the capacity to, as a kind of translation mechanism,

177
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a capacity as a kind of scaffolding system by which different kinds of actions and actors and participants

178
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
can organize in relationship to one another.

179
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So lots of technical definitions of platforms.

180
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
One of my PhD students, Stephanie Shermans, currently writing a book on the kind of early history of platforms

181
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
in the industrial era with an emphasis on Fordism.

182
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So it's also, I think, important to say just for your listeners that when we're talking about platforms,

183
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
we're not just talking about things like Airbnb and Uber and these contemporary versions of platforms

184
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that, for example, Nick Terncheck writes about in Platform Capitalism,

185
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
where Nick is focusing on sort of the sort of contemporary face of many of these platforms.

186
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We can also think of platforms going back to the beginning of the urban grid as a kind of platform.

187
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Some would argue even the tetrahedral body plan as a kind of platform.

188
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But the platform as an organizational and technical logic has a historical scope

189
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
that precedes computation and precedes planetary scale computation.

190
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But it's one in which the planetary scale computations, we define it,

191
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
never would have happened if it was not organized through, as we understand it,

192
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
never would have happened if it wasn't organized through platforms.

193
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So we can talk about things like the search engine as a kind of platform

194
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in that a search engine doesn't make any of the content that's on the Internet.

195
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It simply organizes the content that other people put on the Internet in such a way that in theory

196
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
it makes that content more valuable both for the producer and the receiver of that content.

197
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So you put your website or your photos or whatever on the platform,

198
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
there's now thousands or if not millions of people who will see this information,

199
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
which in a way somehow makes it that now those items are more valuable for you

200
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because you've placed them on the platform.

201
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They're more valuable for the receiver to place on the platform.

202
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And so this is all obviously in theory.

203
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But here's that key idea around the economic difference

204
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and where they differentiate from states and markets.

205
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If states reproduce themselves, are able to in essence pay for their provision of public services

206
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
primarily through taxation, that they identify kind of choke points within value chains

207
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
such as a port or where goods are coming in and out or something.

208
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And they identify these kinds of choke points within value chains

209
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and then they absorb some of the value from these choke points in the form of taxation,

210
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
which then pays for the long-term provision of the public services that made the production of that value possible

211
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
in the first place and so on and so forth.

212
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But it's through taxation in essence that they reproduce themselves.

213
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Whereas corporations in the normal way of understanding them as capitalist structures

214
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
reproduce themselves through commodities and transactions,

215
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that you produce a commodity, you pay charge more for the commodity

216
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and there's difference in this surplus between the two in the form of profit

217
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
constitutes this ability for the corporation to reproduce itself.

218
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Platforms don't work either way.

219
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They don't tax you and they don't charge you.

220
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So how do they work?

221
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They work fundamentally through the rationalization of the information

222
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that populates the platform in such a way that that information becomes more valuable

223
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
for the users of the platform.

224
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It rationalizes the information that populates the platform

225
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
such that that information becomes more valuable for the users of the platform.

226
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And that differential between, let's say, the value of the information before it's concluded

227
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and after it's included in the platform is the basis of how they reproduce themselves.

228
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Currently, many of those are then dependent upon

229
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
a sort of a secondary dependence market upon advertising.

230
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But I would argue that that's sort of a contingent arrangement

231
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that you can have and indeed have had lots of platforms

232
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
that are, that produce, that actually reproduce themselves

233
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
from many other kinds of ways besides that.

234
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So first of all, just as a sort of a definitional basis of platforms

235
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
from the basis of our discussion.

236
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So a platform of platforms, as you've asked me sort of here as well,

237
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
would refer to some other kind of meta-infrastructural mechanism

238
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
that allows for multiple platforms to interoperate with each other.

239
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And so you can think of it a bit as a kind of first order platforms

240
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
that are structuring and scaffolding structural systems

241
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
that allow for the rationalization of information that's included in them.

242
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And then you can imagine sort of an aggregation of multiple platforms

243
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that in essence allows the platforms themselves to interoperate with one another

244
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
in such a way that they have this, in principle that you have an even more,

245
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
that you have other kinds of deliberate or emergent effects

246
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
situated one way or another.

247
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Now, to the question about the interface layer that you asked

248
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
about where the politics sits within this.

249
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I think in many ways the politics of the platforms

250
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
is situated in many different places.

251
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And all the different points of description that I've argued here

252
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
are all places that are ones that are interesting

253
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
because they mediate power in some kind of way,

254
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
that they are relevant, platforms are relevant as social technologies

255
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
because they organize power in some way.

256
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
To me this isn't a reason to exclude them,

257
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
but rather to in essence to be interested in them

258
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and to try to understand how they can function as means

259
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
for collective reason and societal self-composition.

260
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And to be quite concerned about the ways in which they

261
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
are not living up to that assignment today

262
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
because we should expect that of them.

263
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And because they may not be doing so today

264
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it's possible to criticize them for this fact

265
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because indeed this is something that should be expected of them.

266
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The question of the interface layer,

267
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the interface layer as I defined it has to do really with,

268
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the interface layer is the semiotic layer within the system

269
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
that allows for the translation between users that are participating

270
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
in the larger system and that system itself.

271
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So in the simplest sense you're using your computer,

272
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you're seeing all the buttons with words on them on the screen.

273
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Of all of the possible things you could do with your computer,

274
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
of all the possible things your computer could do

275
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
now that it's connected to the internet,

276
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
all of those trillions and trillions and trillions of possibilities

277
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
are reduced to a composable array of several dozen menu items

278
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
that you can sort of choose between.

279
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That map reduction of all of those possibilities

280
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
into this composable array of menu functions

281
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
is unavoidably ideological, is unavoidably political

282
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
if you want to think of it in those terms,

283
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
constriction or collapse of the space of possibilities

284
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
into a range of options.

285
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I would also argue though in a certain sense

286
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
that this is to a certain sense unavoidable as well

287
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
in that it has, when I call it a map reduction,

288
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
this is exactly what it is.

289
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
In the same way in which you don't want a map of your city

290
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
that is one-to-one with your city,

291
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
you don't want a map of the city

292
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
that includes absolutely everything in your city on it

293
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and would be in essence the most accurate map possible of your city.

294
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You want a map that only includes,

295
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that gets rid of 99% of everything that's there,

296
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that only shows you that 1% that might be the most relevant

297
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
for the purposes of the abstractions of navigation.

298
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Interface layer functions in a similar way.

299
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's a kind of reductive abstraction of the space

300
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of the vectors of navigation through the space.

301
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And because of this function of simplification,

302
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
it also allows for the network effects of the millions of people

303
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
for whom this map is legible to actually use the system,

304
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
to participate in the system, to generate value for the system,

305
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
to have value generated for them from the system

306
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
because of its simplification and its arrangement

307
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
in the same way in which a simple map

308
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
makes the city navigable for more people.

309
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
On the one hand, you can see this as having a kind of democratizing effect,

310
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but there's a political valence of that.

311
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
There's a political valence in the map reduction problem itself

312
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and the ideological constraint.

313
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
There's also a political function of this

314
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in that in the network's effects of participation,

315
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:41,000
you have the kinds of aggregations of user participants in such a way

316
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that they themselves enter into social relations

317
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that they wouldn't have been able to do so otherwise.

318
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So we're still kind of setting the groundwork, I think,

319
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
for maybe the meat of our discussion,

320
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
but if that's helpful in terms of kind of the definitional terms

321
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
for how from not just a computer science perspective,

322
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
but indeed from a sociological theory or economics or political science perspective,

323
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
how it is that we can understand the terms of these interrelations

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and what is specific about platforms,

325
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
what is generic about platforms in terms of how they function in these ways,

326
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
then perhaps that's helpful.

327
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes, absolutely.

328
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This is super helpful, I guess,

329
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and it's super important that we get to understand this in a different form.

330
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And you have already touched upon how...

331
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm sorry, your question was about what other kinds of platforms could happen.

332
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So the reason I answer in this way is that defining platforms in this...

333
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I first would say there's lots of kinds of platforms that only could happen.

334
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I want to point your listeners' attention also historically

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
to look at all of the kind of histories of platforms that in fact have preceded us

336
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and to understand some of the structures there.

337
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So I'm sorry, please go ahead.

338
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
No, I just wanted to say that we already touched upon

339
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
how this idea of platform of platforms might be able to address

340
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
what has been called the socialist calculation problem

341
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
or the socialist pricing problem, you call it.

342
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But in your texts you also point that it might be able to solve

343
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
the capitalist pricing problem.

344
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And maybe let's just point out what that is

345
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and how a platform of platforms might be able to address this one.

346
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Sure. Yeah, and there's lots of other pricing problems as well

347
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
besides just those two.

348
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In some respects, I think we may want to...

349
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Going forward, I think we'll probably want to open up the space of possibilities

350
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
beyond this sort of simple Cold War dynamic of that as well.

351
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But yeah, to your point, I argue in the book that in many ways

352
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
it's the capitalist pricing...

353
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The capitalist pricing problem, as I call it,

354
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
that it maybe is the more pressing issue now.

355
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So if through whatever bending arcs of historical irony

356
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
it ended up being Walmart and Amazon that proved that Hayek was wrong

357
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and that the socialist cybernauticians were right

358
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and that these big capitalist companies solved the socialist pricing problem

359
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
in whatever strange way,

360
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
the capitalist pricing problem, as I define it,

361
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
really has to do in terms of...

362
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
is a way of thinking about pricing systems

363
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
in relationship to negative externalities.

364
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And in a larger sense, I see this as part of the question

365
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
of the more important question of

366
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
ultimately what is planetary scale computation for?

367
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
If the stack was a book that was about

368
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
what is planetary scale computation and how does it work,

369
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
the next book is really more trying to speak to this question again.

370
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What is planetary scale computation for?

371
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
How do we would see it in longer historical terms

372
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and maybe even in geologic terms,

373
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
in sort of anthropocene scale kinds of terms.

374
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What does it mean now that it's possible for human societies

375
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and indeed human societies to calculate their own,

376
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
to model and calculate their own processes

377
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
with such speed and clarity,

378
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
but also in many ways how it's possible for,

379
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
if you think of the entire apparatus itself,

380
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
of the satellite systems, the transoceanic cables,

381
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
the data centers, this entire planet,

382
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
this entire kind of artificial crust

383
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
that we have produced around the surface of the planet,

384
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
what it means for also to create for a planet

385
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
to be able to model itself and act back upon itself

386
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
with such sophistication.

387
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
How do we understand this even in geological terms

388
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in terms of the arc and history of the planet?

389
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And so there's some questioning then

390
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
of how to locate the question of planetary scale computation

391
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
within some of the philosophical questionings

392
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
after planetarity itself and how this would function.

393
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Now, to the question of the capitalist pricing problem,

394
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
back to this, the capitalist pricing problem,

395
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
as I define it, and again, it's rather schematic,

396
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
has to do with the negative externalities

397
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
within economic transactions

398
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and this trying to locate the question of economics,

399
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the ontology of economics within that of ecology more broadly.

400
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Excuse me.

401
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So the question of the ontology of economics,

402
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
that is, what is value? What is valuable?

403
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And how can something be identified as valuable

404
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
in whatever sense is, in theory, represented within the price?

405
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That if there is, in theory, 10 euros of value within this item,

406
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
that the price of this will be 10 euros,

407
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and that the capacity for calculation,

408
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the markets to calculate this or central computer to calculate this,

409
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that there is some either correspondence

410
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
between the price and the underlying value

411
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
or distortion of correspondence

412
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
between the price and the underlying value.

413
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so for Hayek, the socialist pricing problem

414
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
represented a distortion of value

415
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
in that it could never really know

416
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
whether something was overpriced or underpriced

417
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because it couldn't calculate it fast enough.

418
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What many of those, it's not my idea,

419
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
but many of those working in fields of ecological economics

420
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
have identified is that there's a different kind of distortion

421
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that's happening within the market price

422
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
in that there are underlying social and ecological costs

423
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
to the production and transaction and consumption of commodities

424
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
that are not reflected in the price.

425
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
These are called negative externalities.

426
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
They would include, so if that $100 barrel of oil,

427
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
if it costs $100 because the amount that's available

428
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
on the world market at any point in time

429
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
would suggest that this is the price of it,

430
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
what that price signal does not include, for example,

431
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
are the immediate and or long-term costs of burning that oil,

432
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
of releasing that, of liberating that carbon into the atmosphere,

433
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and the costs of its ramifications,

434
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
whether those are immediate health costs

435
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
or long-term subtraction costs.

436
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We were having a lot of discussions with colleagues

437
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
around negative emissions technologies

438
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and the need for not only the decarbonization,

439
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
not putting more carbon into the atmosphere,

440
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
but the subtraction of existing carbon from the atmosphere

441
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
in order to keep it 2 degrees Celsius.

442
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The real question of this is how do you pay for it?

443
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, part of the reason you can't pay for it

444
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
is because the cost of the production of that carbon

445
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
in the first place was not reflected

446
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
in the price signal of the oil that produced that carbon

447
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
in its first instance, as you see.

448
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And so this represents a distortion of the pricing.

449
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The question then for going to this question

450
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
of what planetary scale computation is for

451
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
is to ask the question is,

452
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
would it be possible to undistort this signal?

453
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Would it be possible for there to be a price signal

454
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that was in essence not distorted in this way?

455
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It would have to be a price signal where, for example,

456
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
the price of that barrel of oil would somehow be able to count,

457
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
be inclusive of not just the transactional value,

458
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
but ultimately all of the secondary and tertiary costs

459
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and value that would be associated with that item,

460
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
such that it would be the cost of the barrel of mine

461
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
being $500 a barrel or $1,500 a barrel,

462
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
if that's what it would cost to actually deal with this.

463
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Now, what I sort of hypothesize in the book a bit

464
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
more of as a thought experiment

465
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
than as a policy recommendation

466
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
is to ask them what you would need then is some ability

467
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
for some kind of economics calculative substrate

468
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
that was able not just to identify

469
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
the immediate transactional relations,

470
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
but to hypothesize a futural value of that,

471
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
to imagine in the future what the cost of that would be

472
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that has not happened yet.

473
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So you burn the barrel of oil in the future

474
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that will be these costs that are associated with it

475
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
in the form of negative externalities,

476
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but how much is that for one barrel of oil

477
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
or for 10 barrels of oil or for one bicycle

478
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
or for one lunch or for one whatever?

479
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
There would be a future cost that hasn't happened yet.

480
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
There would have to be a way, in essence, to price the future.

481
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
How would you calculate the pricing of the future

482
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
into the transaction in some kind of way?

483
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So this sort of led us to some of the questions

484
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
about the ways in which planetary scale computation

485
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
has already been used as a method for futural modeling

486
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and the production of models of the future

487
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
that can or should have some recursive capacity

488
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
to govern the present.

489
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And that's really what I think this question

490
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
of the capitalist pricing,

491
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the de-distortion of the capitalist pricing

492
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that it comes down to,

493
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
how can objective empirical statistically valid models

494
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
of the future govern the present in some kind of way?

495
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So that includes, there's a lot of other discussions

496
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
about just the general capacities of prospection,

497
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
of how it is that the predictive structures of the future

498
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
as part of human cognition play into this,

499
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
the ways in which the kind of preemptive logics

500
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
of the biopolitics of planetary scale computation

501
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
play into this.

502
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But we were looking at basically two things.

503
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
One was climate science.

504
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And one of the, I think the key points for this

505
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
is that I make the argument that climate change itself,

506
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
not the physical geophysical fact of climate change,

507
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
but the concept of climate change,

508
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the statistical regularity that the earth is warming,

509
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
is itself an epistemological accomplishment

510
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
of planetary scale computation.

511
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That without this sensing, calculation, simulation,

512
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
modeling apparatus of planetary scale computation,

513
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the very idea of climate change as a kind of

514
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
reductive statistical regularity of a hockey stick arc

515
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
of all of the things that are going on in the planet

516
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
could not be possible.

517
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And one of the things, it wasn't possible to calculate.

518
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
This is a better example of what planetary scale computation

519
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
is for, if you ask me, and a different kind of model

520
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
of its ultimate social, technical,

521
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and ecological potential.

522
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But it's also one that is based on this,

523
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
of a kind of a temporal and historical differential

524
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
between the past and the future.

525
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's used not only to mark a present moment,

526
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
but also to sample moments in the past

527
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
through ice core sampling or other kinds of things

528
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
to try to understand the kind of the calculus,

529
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the statistical differential arc of this

530
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
over a long period of time,

531
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
and also to produce valid computational simulations

532
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
of what the next 10 years, or 20 years,

533
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
or 30 years, or 40 years are being like.

534
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And so when we look at all the IPCC scenarios,

535
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and they're forking into the future,

536
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
depending on what happens,

537
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
these are computational simulations

538
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
dependent upon different presumptions and first principles.

539
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But they are models of the future that we can

540
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and should be using to govern the present.

541
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That's what climate science is going to do for it.

542
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And so this is one example by which, yes,

543
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
we can imagine ways in which we have models of the future

544
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that we wish to have recursively come back

545
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and model the present.

546
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The other one, a bit more prosaic that we've been

547
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
experimenting with is around, of all things, insurance.

548
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Insurance is another way in which the future is priced,

549
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and that it's priced in a way that acts back upon

550
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the changes, the price signal of something we do in the present.

551
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So if you're, one of my favorite magazines of all time

552
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
is a magazine called Schaden Spiegel.

553
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's the magazine of the German Reinsurance Agency.

554
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's basically like disaster monthly,

555
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but it also has some of the most amazingly sober

556
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
descriptions of the implications of climate change

557
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
on large-scale infrastructure that you'll be able to find anywhere.

558
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Because they're the ones on the hook for a lot of this,

559
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
ultimately, of where this would go.

560
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And so if you wanted to build that piece of infrastructure,

561
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
not only does it need to be insured,

562
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
but the insurance company needs to get reinsurance against it.

563
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And if the reinsurance company realizes that that thing

564
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is going to be extremely vulnerable to climate irregularities,

565
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
you can't get it insured.

566
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Or if you get it insured, the price of doing it now

567
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
is going to be so much higher because that insurance policy

568
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
will be so expensive that it actually changes the price signal

569
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
of whether we should build that infrastructure thing in the first place.

570
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So you see where I'm going with this.

571
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That if you can actually think about what the long-term climatic ramifications

572
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
of some kind of action or investment would be in the future,

573
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
such that those negative externalities are not only not excluded

574
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
from the price, but are formed the basis of the model

575
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
by which the price is produced in the first place.

576
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Then you go some distance towards at least de-distorting

577
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that initial price signal in such a way that you have a transformation

578
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
to some extent what we even mean by price in the first place.

579
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You introduce a different temporality to economic ontology,

580
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and that what constitutes value is being produced

581
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
in relationship to not only future value in the same way

582
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
as stock price is related to future value,

583
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
but also related to future costs in ways in which that are inclusive in this.

584
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
This is a bit what we mean by that idea.

585
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Obviously, some of the open questions here is how total of a system

586
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
is necessary for this to work.

587
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Is there a way in which does this have to be entirely some sort

588
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
of massively centralized mechanism, but through which other forms

589
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
of valuation can't escape, or is there some kind of way

590
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
in which even the organized participation

591
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
within a kind of economics of this sort that is futureal in this way,

592
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
that is inclusive of what are present externalities in some sort of way,

593
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is there some kind of way that participation on this can be incentivized

594
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
in a way in which it itself becomes a kind of catalytic institution,

595
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
a kind of bottom-up institution rather than necessarily one

596
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,000
that requires some kind of Skynet system to enforce itself.

597
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I think that's kind of an open question,

598
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
which means that in a certain way we're back to where we started.

599
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Is that if all of this started in a debate between is it possible to have,

600
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
can we only have bottom-up organization of this and will it work itself out,

601
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
or do we need some kind of centralized top-down piloting function

602
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
to make all of this work properly?

603
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
If that's where this argument started in the 1950s,

604
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
even when we're talking about how you incentivize participation

605
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
within this situation I described,

606
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
that question doesn't present itself as already solved.

607
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
This is super interesting and I think there's a different layer to it,

608
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
which is quite important as well,

609
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
because actually I think what you're kind of saying is that

610
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
the future is already priced, but it could be priced much better.

611
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And this kind of stays within the realm of pricing the future

612
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and argues for better models and the incorporation of externalities

613
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
specifically into the question of pricing.

614
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
For example, yes.

615
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But there is a different level,

616
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and maybe this is the homo sapiens level at the end,

617
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
there's a different level to this.

618
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And Evgeny Morozov writes about it in his essay

619
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
in the New Left Review on Digital Socialism,

620
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and I'd like to quote him here,

621
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
When Austrian economists respond to today's defenders of central planning

622
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
by noting that any non-capitalist system,

623
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
even one rooted in the power of big data,

624
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
could only beat the efficiency of the price system

625
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
if it also created new behavioral modes and frameworks of meaning,

626
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
they have a point.

627
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I think this is super important

628
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and I think it's relevant for what you just said as well,

629
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and at least in two key aspects,

630
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
it's relevant for the question of synthetic catalectsies to come,

631
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
specifically if they are embedded in some form of red futurism.

632
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
The first one would be, and this is implicit in Morozov's quote,

633
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
that prices are not just numerical, but social,

634
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and that it is therefore not enough to find a different method

635
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
of quantification or weighing.

636
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So this would kind of mean that it's not enough

637
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
to price the future even better,

638
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
because there's still the question of new behavioral modes

639
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and frameworks of meaning,

640
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
which are kind of an obstacle and a chance, I guess.

641
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And the second one is that markets are not equal to capital

642
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and that capital does not necessarily need markets,

643
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and that therefore the force of capital as such

644
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
would need to be abolished if one wanted to be serious

645
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
about synthetic catalectsies as red futurism.

646
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And this is a specific form, you know?

647
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So I think those are probably two questions,

648
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and maybe if I just, so I can keep them in my mind at once,

649
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
maybe we ask them, I'll try to answer them one at a time,

650
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
and maybe you can ask me the second one again after this as well.

651
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So I would say that I don't disagree,

652
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I probably don't disagree essentially with the point that

653
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
that simply another,

654
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
just a different means of calculating price

655
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
about the same thing would be sufficient.

656
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What I'm calling a kind of a shift in economic ontology

657
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
goes to that question of what value is

658
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and what is even being priced in the first place.

659
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So it's not just when we're talking about a barrel of oil,

660
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
it's not just this particular assemblage of molecules

661
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
that is transacting owners,

662
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
but it's understood to be a whole other set

663
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
of past, present, and future dynamics

664
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
that one has illegal liability in its relationship to

665
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
that becomes part of the price.

666
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And I think another way in which this goes back to this question

667
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
of insurance and another future thing,

668
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
part of the question about price has to do with,

669
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and another kind of externality is a political externality

670
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
in that it is the institutions that allow in essence

671
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
for the renunciation of liability in relationship to something.

672
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And you can just think, I mean, in the simplest possible sense,

673
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
think of this in terms of like trash.

674
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So like you've got something in your house

675
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and you put it out in the garbage can

676
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and like someone comes along and takes it and says,

677
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
well, this isn't yours anymore

678
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
because you put it in the trash, right?

679
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And somehow in the act of like getting rid of it,

680
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
you're not only renouncing property claims over it,

681
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
you're also renouncing liability claims over it as well, right?

682
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And so part of the process of the reason

683
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
why negative externalities can even work in this way

684
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
is because we have this magic function

685
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
by which the renunciation of private property

686
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
constitutes the renunciation of liability.

687
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So I can spew all of the carbon dioxide

688
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
into the atmosphere once I want.

689
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And once it's sort of above the airspace property line

690
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
of my factory, it's no longer my carbon dioxide,

691
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and therefore I'm no longer liable for this carbon dioxide.

692
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So you see the point about this renunciation of liability

693
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
in this space as well.

694
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Now, what I'm talking about as the shift

695
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
of a kind of economic ontology has to do some ways

696
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
in which that magic function of renunciation of liability

697
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and renunciation of sort of embeddedness

698
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
within these socio-molecular relations

699
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
is not something that can be so easily renounced,

700
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
that is in fact part of what you're buying

701
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
when you enter into the relations

702
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
with that barrel of oil in the first place.

703
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So that is part of what I mean.

704
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So that is a bit where it seems like

705
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I probably agree with Evgeny in the sense to which

706
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
it's not just a matter of finding another mechanism

707
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
by which we measure the same thing.

708
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's a matter of changing

709
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
what we're measuring in the first place.

710
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But where I would say, where it may be disagree,

711
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
when he says something like,

712
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I think your line was a measure,

713
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
it's not just a matter of measuring and calculating

714
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
something but rather something else

715
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
because these have social relations.

716
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I think my point is that measuring and calculating

717
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
are social relations.

718
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
What he's saying is it can't just be

719
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
these measuring things because it's social.

720
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm saying that is in fact what the social is.

721
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Measuring things and calculating things and weighing things

722
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
not only have social functions,

723
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
they are social functions.

724
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They are sort of the key social functions

725
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
as part of this whole kind of dynamic as well.

726
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And so it is for sure something that needs to go deeper

727
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
into this question of how we identify

728
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
not only how we value the thing

729
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
but what the thing is in the first place.

730
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So agreed.

731
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Now whether or not this constitutes

732
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
a kind of behavioral change, it would.

733
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It's a matter of, it's an open question though

734
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I think whether or not the behavioral

735
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and psychological transformation would be the cause

736
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
or the effect.

737
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And honestly there's sort of different approaches

738
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and schools of thought to this.

739
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And this probably goes to a more deeper

740
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
sort of approaches to ecological politics

741
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
and indeed just the kind of dynamics in general.

742
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
For those whose alliance,

743
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
whose those sort of like way of seeing the world

744
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
is one in which large scale change happens

745
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
through the accumulation of virtuous acts.

746
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
That if enough people do enough virtuous acts

747
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and those virtuous acts assemble into millions and billions

748
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and trillions of virtuous acts,

749
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
then there will be an infrastructural transformation

750
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
will ensue through this deliberate conscious

751
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
psychological moral shift in paradigmatic worldview

752
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and then the accumulation of virtuous acts.

753
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And then there's others.

754
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And I would be on the second side of this a bit more

755
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
that would suggest in many ways the history of technology

756
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and the history of society are not only intertwined

757
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
with one another, but in many respects,

758
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
shifts in social systems and in cultural systems

759
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and indeed in political and economic systems

760
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
usually happen more as an effect of transformations

761
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
within underlying technological systems.

762
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This is in a certain sense

763
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
based a superstructure kind of approach

764
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
that in transformations not just in the means of production,

765
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
but indeed in the mode of production

766
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
that you then see shifts in culture

767
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and shifts in psychology as a result of these.

768
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And so I think in many respects,

769
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
my inclination would be to look at ways

770
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
in which you'll get greater leverage faster

771
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
by looking at ways in which there would be shifts

772
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
in geotechnology and shifts in geoeconomics

773
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that would bring about shifts in geoculture

774
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
rather than trying to bring about a spiritual transformation

775
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that would subsequently down the line

776
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
transform those geotechnologies.

777
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's really not because of an aesthetic preference

778
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
of this so much, but rather than just,

779
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I think that the history of economics

780
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and the history of technology suggest

781
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
that that's the more likely path.

782
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But at least as far as I understand it,

783
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
the question that he's aiming at when he's saying

784
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
new behavioral modes and frameworks of meaning,

785
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
it's more about what are the crucial points

786
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
that are not only concerned with these technical aspects

787
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
of, for example, how to price the future any better

788
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
because these ideas of externalities

789
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and how you can behave with your property,

790
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
this is ingrained in the very concept of property as such.

791
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So if you are not able to change this idea of property

792
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
as a form of behavioral mode and a framework of meaning,

793
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
then you won't get to a point where you will be effective

794
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
in bringing people to a point of not treating it

795
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
as an externality.

796
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Do you see what I mean?

797
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I think there's a way of approaching it

798
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
from the perspective of, okay, we need to find

799
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
a more effective pricing mechanism for these externalities,

800
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
or we need to find a way to address this social institution

801
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
of property as such because the property as such,

802
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
as a social institution and a framework of meaning,

803
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
is one of the root causes for the ways we do address

804
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
these questions on a large scale.

805
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And this is not coming from a moral perspective,

806
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
but as well from a perspective of effectiveness, I guess.

807
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Possibly.

808
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I agree with you everything up to the point of the phrase

809
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
root cause.

810
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I see it as root effect.

811
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I completely agree with you that ultimately you can't have

812
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
one without the other.

813
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't argue with this at all.

814
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
If there is a changing in somehow, even at the level

815
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
of some shift in the geotechnology of pricing

816
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and organization and the ontology of property

817
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
that has some kind of planetary scale legal binding structure,

818
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
if this isn't, in fact, become part of the culture

819
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
of our relationship to object and molecular assemblages

820
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
around us and our socioeconomic environment,

821
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
if it doesn't actually become a social infrastructure

822
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and doesn't actually become the basis of the way

823
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
in which we plan, conceptualize, model,

824
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and recursively organize our relationship

825
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to the material world, then it's nothing.

826
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It's not even a technology because it's not being used.

827
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There's no argument.

828
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I absolutely agree.

829
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And then part of the question is, how is it

830
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
that at societal levels that the kind of models

831
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that we have, cognitive models, at an individual level

832
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and at a group level, cognitive models that understand

833
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and calculate advantage, calculate the future,

834
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
calculate our interests, calculate our interactions

835
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
with these kinds of things are done so in relationship

836
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
to these differential systems.

837
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
If that isn't part of how we are rethinking the world,

838
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
then these technologies are, in fact, not even technologies.

839
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I would agree with that because they're not

840
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
being used in this way.

841
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
What I'm simply suggesting is that there is a presumption,

842
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
and I think, honestly, I think it's one that's rather deep

843
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
in a Western liberal individualist framework,

844
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that first there is a cognitive psychological transformation

845
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that then is made manifest upon the world,

846
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
that somehow the agency and subjectivity are the same thing,

847
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
that our agency in the world is ultimately

848
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
a function of our subjectivity.

849
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And what I'm suggesting, honestly, I think I'm making

850
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
more of a Marxian argument that in many ways

851
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
that the transformations in the mode of production,

852
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and I would include these shifts in economic ontology

853
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
as a shift in the mode of production,

854
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
ultimately transforms the culture in its image more so.

855
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You can't have one without the other,

856
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
but in terms of where it is that we should,

857
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
where I would place my bet, now speaking of the future,

858
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
so placing my bet on which is more a cause of the other,

859
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm going to vote that base causes superstructure

860
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
more than superstructure causes base.

861
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Nice, super nice.

862
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I love this answer, and it already touches upon

863
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
one of the next questions which is concerned with the individual.

864
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
This has been the first part of the Future Histories Live event

865
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
with Benjamin Bretton.

866
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I hope you enjoyed it, I certainly did.

867
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
If you want to support Future Histories,

868
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
then you can do so via Patreon or through a simple donation.

869
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And if you're not able to support Future Histories economically,

870
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
then this is absolutely fine,

871
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
because there is a fantastic money-free way

872
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
to support the project too,

873
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and that is by telling a friend about the show

874
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
who might be interested in the topics we discuss here.

875
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Thank you all, and hear you in two weeks.
