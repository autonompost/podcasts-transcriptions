00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,920
Yevgeny Matosov in today's episode.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,120
He is a researcher and writer as well as founder of the knowledge curation platform The Syllabus.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,060
Regular listeners will know that I highly appreciate his work.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,960
Time and time again, Yevgeny succeeds in pushing our thoughts further through his very thorough

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,400
research and sharp thinking.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,640
So you can imagine that I was and still am quite excited to have the chance to welcome

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
him as a guest in Future Histories.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
In many ways, this couldn't be more fitting.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,960
And there is an exciting announcement to make related to me and Yevgeny recording this episode

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,560
because a transcript of this episode will be featured in an upcoming book I co-edit

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,240
together with Christoph Sorg.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,840
It's an edited volume called Creative Construction, Plant Economies in the 21st Century and Beyond

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
and it will be published with Bristol University Press.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,440
I am absolutely thrilled about the fantastic group of people that are coming together for

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,440
this edited volume.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,800
There are contributions by Laura Horn, Jakob Heyer, Samia Mohamed, Nick Dyer-Witherford,

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:40,120
There will be a chapter by Elena Hoferbeth, Matthias Schmelzer and Cedric Durand.

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Christoph Sorg will of course provide the chapter as will I myself.

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,160
And there will be transcripts of two conversations, one between Nancy Fraser and Christoph Sorg

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,000
and one, you guessed it, between Yevgeny Morozov and myself.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,560
I can promise you that this is not the last time you'll hear me be absolutely excited

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,100
about this book.

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,640
Right now the release is scheduled for May 2024 and be assured I'll keep you updated

25
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,960
on that.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,920
Now that I have so shamelessly indulged in self-promotion for the last few minutes,

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,800
let me be equally excited about an upcoming project by Yevgeny.

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,880
It's a podcast series written and presented by Yevgeny himself and it's called The Santiago

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,660
Boys and it's described as a wild tale of how Salvador Allende's engineers dared to

30
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,820
challenge corporations and spy agencies and almost won a battle for the very soul of

31
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,220
information technology.

32
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,680
You'll find a link to the very stylish website of the Santiago Boys podcast in the show notes.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,740
On the website you'll find a trailer and in order to stay updated until it's released

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,540
this summer, you can subscribe to newsletter.

35
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,980
Yevgeny has worked on this podcast series for quite a while now and has already been

36
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,940
an expert on the topic before that so we can all look forward to a surely exciting approach

37
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
to the topic.

38
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,260
I for once am thrilled and looking forward to listening to this podcast this summer.

39
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,220
Before we finally start, I would like to welcome Saskia as a patron of future histories and

40
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,660
I'd like to thank Urs, Lukas, Wilfried, Fabian, Georg and Karl for their kind donations.

41
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:46,540
And now please enjoy today's episode with Yevgeny Matosov on Discovery Beyond Competition.

42
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
Welcome Yevgeny.

43
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,500
Glad to be here.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,860
There's a lecture you gave at Berkeley titled Beyond Competition, Alternative Discovery

45
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,700
Procedures and the Post-Capitalist Public Sphere and you start the lecture by hinting

46
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,500
towards the, and I quote you here, inability of the left to make sense of digital technologies

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,000
and what to do with them and then you continue that in your view the left has a problem with

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,280
making sense of its own project and related to that you ask, and I quote you again, what

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,820
should their future be other than just defending the welfare state and insisting that they

50
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,200
can humanize capitalism, end quote.

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,020
So I'm of course very much interested in both of these tasks, making sense of a possible

52
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,020
broader project of the left as well as making sense of the role of digital technologies

53
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,820
for such a project.

54
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,180
What are the main challenges surrounding both of these tasks and how are they related to

55
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,420
each other?

56
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:51,180
Well, it's a lot to bite, so I'm not sure how we're going to tackle it.

57
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,260
So probably these issues will pop up as we speak, but so that lecture I think was almost

58
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,940
two years ago that I gave it.

59
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,460
So I think, you know, my thinking always evolves and it probably has evolved since then.

60
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,620
I haven't gotten back to celebrating the left as the kind of the source of forward progressive

61
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,300
thinking on matters of technology, so that hasn't changed.

62
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,040
But to answer your question, I think let's try to tackle them separately.

63
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,640
Let's first tackle some of the problems of the left and then we can talk about technology

64
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,640
because I think ultimately the reason why the left has not been able to come up with

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,960
a more exciting plan for how to use technology and technologies is because it kind of got

66
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:47,900
stuck in a certain intellectual, political trap, if you will.

67
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,140
So before we get it out of that trap, I don't think that any forward thinking about technology

68
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,260
would emerge.

69
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,400
So do you want me to, I mean, like I can go on.

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, of course.

71
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,600
You know, like do you really want me to try to lay it out?

72
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,760
Yes, of course.

73
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
That's why I'm asking.

74
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,400
No, no, because it's a huge question.

75
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,540
I mean, it's a question about which you can borrow the right 10 books and you can have

76
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,440
an entire book imprint of Verso books dedicated just to that question.

77
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:26,020
So fine, let me start because it's so abstract that I feel like I might not land if I jump

78
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
off that plane.

79
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
You can try.

80
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Fine.

81
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,100
So let me try to outline it.

82
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:40,340
So traditionally, I think the left has inherited this idea, or at least the radical left that's

83
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:50,280
liberal Keynesian left has inherited this idea that somehow its task is to figure out

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:07:01,120
how to deploy the tools of planning and all the associated knowledge techniques and repertoires

85
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:11,940
in order to show that the market does a suboptimal job at allocating resources.

86
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Right.

87
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,740
So the project of the left has been essentially, and again, I'm not talking about Keynesians.

88
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,500
I'm talking about kind of hardcore left.

89
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,340
The project has been to show that you can build alternative rationalities of allocating

90
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,800
goods and resources that would beat the rationality of the market.

91
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,360
And to some extent, you know, it has been done with various success in places like the

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:50,320
Soviet Union, partially, of course, by relying on all sorts of techniques like input output

93
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,680
methods and whatnot.

94
00:07:53,660 --> 00:08:02,820
The temptation within that tradition, of course, is to think that now that we have more tools

95
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:10,340
and techniques of organizing knowledge, including those of big data and artificial intelligence,

96
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:19,100
we should essentially try to recover that focus on allocating goods and resources and

97
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,040
turbocharge it essentially with these new techniques and to show and prove to the liberal,

98
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:33,400
to the neoliberals, if you will, who have shifted this debate into this knowledge-intensive

99
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,760
dimension thanks to people like Hayek and before he meets us.

100
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,960
And the objective is to show them that essentially they got it wrong, that market is suboptimal

101
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,180
and that there is a better way to do it.

102
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:54,260
And we can have a better allocative rationality if you want to put it that way.

103
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:05,460
This is what I think is what some of the most tech-friendly leftists imagine the task of

104
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,620
the left to be.

105
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:23,200
I, for one, remain skeptical that this task should retain the focus that it has retained

106
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,960
within that cohort.

107
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,200
I don't even think that it's a mainstream focus of the left, to be honest.

108
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:38,440
I think that the left that has not opted for Keynesianism has opted for some kind of Hayekian

109
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,640
view that markets are better at organizing knowledge and that maybe we should just focus

110
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
on somehow cleaning up afterwards.

111
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,560
And the left that is still thinking about something that goes beyond the market or some

112
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:02,520
kind of Keynesian multiplier is trying to recover and improve and turbocharge the toolkit

113
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,960
of Soviet planning.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Me, I've been thinking about these issues for quite a few years now and the conclusion

115
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,880
I've reached, which I don't think I'm going to lay out in full in this conversation because

116
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm still working on finishing a book, I've started on this, so it's kind of thinking

117
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
in progress.

118
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,920
Even though I know the answer, I will keep the suspense and not give you what I really

119
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,400
think about all of these issues.

120
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,680
Ultimately, the conclusion I've reached is that there is so much more for the left to

121
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:42,360
do with this technologist if only it slightly tweaks the initial question with which it

122
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,480
starts this operation.

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,240
And the question with which it starts this operation now, I think, is still primarily

124
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,160
focused on how do we satisfy human needs and the needs that are basic.

125
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,060
How do we make sure that people get fat?

126
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,740
How do we make sure that people get enough adequate housing?

127
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,580
How do we make sure that all of these basic needs are satisfied?

128
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,100
There is, of course, a huge debate on the left.

129
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,660
How do you count needs?

130
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,500
How do you quantify them?

131
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,860
How do you qualify them?

132
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Are they trans-historical?

133
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
Are they permanent?

134
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,060
Do they change?

135
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,900
That's a whole debate of its own and I don't want to take any position in that debate in

136
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,620
this conversation.

137
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:30,860
But ultimately, I think as long as you retain your focus within this needs paradigm, if

138
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,100
you will, you are not going to ask truly exciting questions that will allow you as a leftist

139
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,740
to win over the neoliberal camp and their vision of the market.

140
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,300
Because their vision of the market is no longer about allocation of goods as it was at the

141
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,220
beginning of this debate, which some of us and people on your podcast would know it probably

142
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,180
already fairly well, which is the big event that starts it as the so-called socialist

143
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:08,340
calculation debate, where the discussion is primarily about which of the two systems does

144
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,580
a better job of satisfying the needs of the populace, whether it's the market or whether

145
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,860
it's the plan.

146
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,540
I don't think that the neoliberals are still arguing about needs, even though the leftists

147
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
still are arguing about needs.

148
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,060
For neoliberals of the most sophisticated kind, the market became something else entirely.

149
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,780
It's a way of organizing the journey into the unknown, as Hayek writes about competition

150
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,340
in one instance.

151
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:44,460
It's a way of assuming and allowing more complexity into our social affairs.

152
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,820
For someone like James Buchanan, it's even an instrument of becoming and allowing people

153
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,780
to discover who they really are and who they want to be.

154
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,380
It's no longer about satisfying basic needs.

155
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,660
This I would argue is what accounts for the buy-in and legitimacy of the market as a tool

156
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,940
of organizing society.

157
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,340
Because for the more sophisticated end of the neoliberal debate, markets are not tools

158
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,940
of organizing economies.

159
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,780
They are infrastructures of organizing civilization.

160
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:28,900
As long as the left doesn't present an equally powerful vision of its infrastructure for

161
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:37,940
organizing civilization and not just allocating raincoats and beds, it will never be able

162
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,940
to defeat neoliberalism, at least ideationally.

163
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
This is the background.

164
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,540
We can jump into any of these points, but this is sort of how I see it.

165
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:54,140
I didn't yet give you any hint, at least in these remarks, as to what this alternative

166
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,300
project of the left might be.

167
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:03,060
But I do think that the fight that the left is fighting, it has no opponent because the

168
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,660
neoliberals have moved on and so has probably the general public.

169
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,020
Much of this discussion about how you can satisfy basic needs using AI and Walmart and

170
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:22,420
Amazon-like planning, it's a debate that I'm not sure anybody on the right, of the sophisticated

171
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,980
neoliberals who have engaged with socialist calculation debate, even needs to hear.

172
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,560
Because these people, if you read them, if you read even somebody like Buchanan writing

173
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,460
about computers in the early 1990s, he will tell you point blank, yeah, sure, computers

174
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,100
can maybe arrive at a perfectly planned economy, but computers will still not give you the

175
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,900
possibility of exploring who you truly are and of unearthing this becoming and discovery

176
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,540
element that the market does.

177
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,340
And this is why socialism will never win.

178
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,820
I mean, this is their argument.

179
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,940
But what I'm saying is that the answer of the left with regards to big tech and AI and

180
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,700
cloud computing and infrastructures has to provide an answer to that critique and not

181
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:20,380
just to the critique of, well, we can allocate rain codes better by using Amazon-like warehouses

182
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,740
methods.

183
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,060
That to me, it's not that relevant.

184
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:34,340
Okay, maybe let's try to pick this apart a bit because I'm wondering to what degree we're

185
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:40,540
talking about a successful myth, so to speak, a narrative on the part of the neoliberals

186
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,300
and to what degree we're talking about an actual ability to bring about something new.

187
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,340
Because depending on what we're talking about, we have to address or we might have to bring

188
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,740
up different alternative solutions.

189
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,460
Because I'm to a certain degree wondering why we should accept this Hayekian myth as

190
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,460
a starting point in the first place, since it's so extremely narrow and somewhat kind

191
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,580
of easy to disprove, I would say, by pointing to the many inventions that are not really

192
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,700
based on monetary incentives and market competition, et cetera.

193
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,180
And when it comes to the public imaginary, for example, it seems that non-market based

194
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:31,180
discovery is somewhat firmly being recognized within a broader public imagination as well,

195
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
I would say.

196
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,020
The stereotype inventor in novels, films, and comics, et cetera, used to be more of

197
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:45,040
a intrinsically motivated nerd figure and not the business type who primarily seeks

198
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
profit.

199
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,460
And I would say that this business type in the liberal version of things only comes into

200
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,780
the picture afterwards when the invention kind of has to be brought to the market, so

201
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
to speak.

202
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,260
But if this is the case, but if discovery is not really the problem because we have

203
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:12,860
these intrinsically motivated nerd types, then this would mean that what we need most

204
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,580
is not so much a new mechanism for the discovery of things, but an alternative mode or alternative

205
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:24,700
modes of allocating funds and democratizing investment, et cetera, in order to then bring

206
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:31,380
about effectively the huge potential for the new, so to speak, that seems to be a somewhat

207
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,180
inherent feature of human potential.

208
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:41,420
And on a worldwide scale, for example, this potential is extremely untapped since, for

209
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,260
example, venture capital has a extreme bias with regard to flowing money to their own

210
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,340
kind regardless of actual ability.

211
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,740
So I would be interested.

212
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,860
Is it a narrative that we are combating in this case, or is it an actual ability of market

213
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,660
competition to really bring about the new?

214
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,860
I mean, you're framing it in a certain way, and I'm not sure that these are the only

215
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:18,260
options in this debate, meaning that I understand what you're saying, but I don't think that

216
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:25,140
the focus on invention is necessarily the correct one, because the whole point of linking

217
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,860
it and lumping it with becoming is that you can also account for the consumer side of

218
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,620
things and not just for the inventor side of things.

219
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,980
So on the consumer side of things, the argument that neoliberals would make is that having

220
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,140
the market as the infrastructure of modernity is what precisely allows you to discover what

221
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,020
you really want, to express your needs and to eventually have them satisfied in a way

222
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,860
that has not been done before, because these needs were not even in your head.

223
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,820
So you can, of course, argue that there are all sorts of ways to do it differently.

224
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,220
And of course, there are.

225
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,820
I'm just saying that it's not just the story of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur

226
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,700
inventing something in the garage.

227
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,540
I mean, there are bigger things at stake here.

228
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:17,060
I think with regards to the story told by neoliberals, if you account for both the consumption

229
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:23,300
side and the production side, and if you account also for a very important element of it, which

230
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,900
is scale, because ultimately the story that somebody like Hayek would tell you is that,

231
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,380
sure, you can have solidarity and altruism in a small community in a village where everybody

232
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,340
knows each other, but as you start scaling things up and you have urbanization and

233
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,740
modernization, it becomes very hard to scale this stuff.

234
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,340
So the additional factor in the neoliberal story, of course, is the process of modernization

235
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:54,940
that, yes, you have what Hayek would say the cash nexus that now penetrates and intermediates

236
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,580
everything in a way that wasn't there before.

237
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,020
But it brings with it certain benefits of which this ability to live in a modern world

238
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,220
where things are discovered and where there is new that's produced by the behavior of

239
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,780
both consumers and entrepreneurs, it's there.

240
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,660
Do I think this story is partly accurate?

241
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Yes.

242
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,780
Do I think that's the only way in which you can account for different alternatives to

243
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:31,940
different possibilities of becoming and discovery and scaling up the process of modernization

244
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,700
in a way that bypasses the market?

245
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,860
Of course, I think it's possible.

246
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,980
But the way I think to go about it is not to dismiss the story told by the neoliberals,

247
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,940
is to instead to historicize it and to say that, look, guys, you have a story that emerges

248
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,860
from the Cold War.

249
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,180
You set up your two punching bags or your punch one punching bag in this case, which

250
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:59,060
was the state or the central state and sort of Keynesian liberals play the supporting

251
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:05,820
Castro every now and then because you could always pick them, pick on them and say, look,

252
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,500
these guys are almost communists, so you can let them play with their monetary policy.

253
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,660
And if you let them play with government spending, eventually we'll all be like the Soviet Union.

254
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,620
So it's kind of one and a half punching bags, if you really want to be accurate.

255
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,540
But why are they the only options?

256
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:31,980
And this is where you really start understanding that you can have a more sophisticated type

257
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,420
of society, so you can have more complexity, you can have more social coordination among

258
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,820
people and actors and institutions that were not in touch before.

259
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,300
That doesn't at all require any mediation by the price mechanism and the price system,

260
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,740
because if the argument made by the neoliberals is that essentially you need the price system

261
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,740
so that people can come together and start coordinating things and coordinating their

262
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,620
needs and understanding what's available, what's not available.

263
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,380
Why not just do it directly?

264
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,220
And if you can do it directly, and we do that actually all the time, we do that actually

265
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,300
in families, you know, when you need to coordinate with your spouse or partner about picking

266
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,340
up kids from a kindergarten, you don't organize an auction and you don't appeal to intellectual

267
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,260
property rights and you don't create a market and that behavior, you just send a message

268
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,660
over WhatsApp or any other type of infrastructure and you basically coordinate how to make something

269
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,820
happen that before that was just a virtuality or was just a hypothetical possibility and

270
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,140
with some basic information exchange, it becomes a reality and an actuality, right?

271
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:48,620
It happens all the time and that should prompt some questions in our mind as to what are

272
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,060
the prerequisites and possibilities for scaling this up and making them richer and making

273
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,940
sure that the types of social coordination that are possible in the market are also possible

274
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,940
in other domains of life and maybe they need the funding and the infrastructures and the

275
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,780
kind of risk-free environments in which to develop.

276
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,380
But this is what I think needs to be essentially, this is the argument that needs to be used

277
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,660
against neoliberals.

278
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:21,740
It's not to say that the market doesn't do it, but what I think we should do is to essentially

279
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,380
accept it and say, yes, the market does it, but it does it with huge costs, first of all,

280
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:33,020
and these costs are not fully accounted for by the neoliberals themselves, very often,

281
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,900
and it's not the only way to do it.

282
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,900
And the organizing religious myth at the core of neoliberalism is that you only have two

283
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,900
options, the market and the state, and there is nothing else in the twin, and if you don't

284
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,540
do the market, you'll eventually end up in Gulag, and that's just not the story, right?

285
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,700
And then, of course, you have all sorts of perversions, yes, you can have Elon Musk taking

286
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,140
a lot of money from the government and blah, blah, blah, but ultimately, you're never going

287
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,700
to win that rhetorical fight, because I think broadly, the story, with a few bad exceptions

288
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,420
that receive a lot of bad press, the story told by neoliberals, to some extent, is partially

289
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
correct.

290
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,420
Yes, you can have a bunch of small entrepreneurs who essentially don't really, who can treat

291
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,700
everything as a black box, because the market system and the price system allows them to,

292
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,420
they don't need to know why there is an earthquake in Sri Lanka or why there is suddenly a bunch

293
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,700
of refugees landing and driving up the prices of shelter accommodation, they don't care

294
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,340
why, they just need to know where the price will be moving, and since the price will be

295
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,340
moving, they can take action and other counterparts can take other action, and yes, you can run

296
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,740
society as a black box, and by running it as a black box, you can essentially coordinate

297
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:55,180
effectively with all sorts of, to use in your classical economics, externalities, and do

298
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,020
we really need them, and maybe we don't, and if we don't need them, then the question

299
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:06,140
becomes what other alternatives and possibilities and infrastructures of social coordination,

300
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,900
discovery and becoming do we need?

301
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,820
Once you pose the question that way, then you really need to have a good answer as to

302
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:20,540
why that program should be a priority and not the program of satisfying basic needs

303
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,660
by giving everybody a coat and a bad bank.

304
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,580
Okay, so I guess now the obvious question is what are the mechanisms, Elkeny?

305
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,940
What are the mechanisms, the infrastructures, etc., that we need to bring about in order

306
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:43,100
to provide for this type of coordination that is able to also be attractive as an alternative

307
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,900
and also, of course, function at this level of abstraction that you are describing?

308
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,700
The question should be why, like why do you want to do that?

309
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,380
Because I think it's a big question, because if, what is the goal?

310
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,540
The goal, one goal might be because you want to generate alternative ways of,

311
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,700
you want to create alternative ways of generating value, right?

312
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,380
Or kind of socialist value that's not capitalist, and you think that you would be able to somehow

313
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:19,500
have people who engage in social coordination with each other, whose social being, if you will,

314
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,220
is productive, but in a non-capitalist way of something that can then be valorized by

315
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,980
society as such, and that be used for satisfying the very basic human needs

316
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,460
that they're now satisfying through the market, right?

317
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:42,620
So that would point towards a more, I don't want to say,

318
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:50,140
economistic, but a very, let's say, social reproduction-like rationale, right?

319
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,780
So you want to, because unless you pose the question why,

320
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,100
I think you're not going to get a very solid answer.

321
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,820
That alternative might be because we think that by facilitating all these

322
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,180
ways of engagement, collaboration, coordination, and so forth, we are advancing society forward,

323
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,580
and we believe in progress because we are progressive, so some of us are,

324
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,820
and we think that it will result in a society that will be many steps

325
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:25,500
above where it was before because you would be able to cure cancer or avoid the next COVID,

326
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,860
and so forth. This is a somewhat different argument for why that needs to be done,

327
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,140
and you can have even other arguments by saying that, well, we think that people should have

328
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,340
the capacity to form whatever groups and communities they want and pursue whatever

329
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,700
styles of life they want, and we should facilitate that, and part of facilitating that would be

330
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,620
providing them with the infrastructure and some kind of opportunities to engage in those different

331
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,220
life forms and lifestyles and to pursue them at scale, which to me would be yet a different

332
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,900
reason, which would require a somewhat different set of interventions, and to some extent,

333
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,900
in neoliberal thought, even though they don't do it a very thorough job of explicating that,

334
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,420
the market serves all these functions. It's an allocative device because it allocates goods,

335
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:25,180
however imperfectly. It's a device and an infrastructure of seeking and allowing for

336
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,700
greater complexity of social interaction, and it's a device which, for better or worse,

337
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,380
allows people to withdraw, if you will, and form their own communities and live as they will,

338
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,500
with all sorts of constraints and restraints. There are probably many other functions,

339
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,460
and I think that when people on the left are posing this question,

340
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,060
they need to understand what part of it they are trying to address. Maybe they want to address

341
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:59,180
all three or four, but I'm not going to give you an answer that from the get-go is going to

342
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:07,180
solve all these problems. All I can tell you is that it seems obvious to me that the basic

343
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:15,100
story accepted by the neoliberals, but also by many people on the left, that the choice between

344
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,100
more market or more state is incorrect. There are plenty of ways we coordinate,

345
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,460
and you don't even need to look at the examples I gave with parents and spouses coordinating over

346
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:33,740
WhatsApp. If you look at a basic school, there is a lot of complexity because there are a lot of

347
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,820
pupils and students and teachers and rooms, and that problem of complexity is solved with a very

348
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,980
simple device called the timetable, which, as far as I'm concerned, is neither an example of the

349
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,020
market nor an example of the state. It's essentially a part of tech infrastructure

350
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:59,500
that greatly reduces complexity and allows for social coordination when none was possible before.

351
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,460
We have hundreds of such devices in everyday life, and we have maybe even thousands of them,

352
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:11,180
and the question then is can we have more? Yes. Can we be more advanced? Yes. Would our life

353
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,420
be more complex, more interesting, more sophisticated, and not depend on the market

354
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:23,020
if we had more and if they were more advanced? Yes. Once you answer yes to all of that,

355
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,980
then you can start asking questions about how our broader tech infrastructure should look like,

356
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,100
what legal facets should it have, what property regime should govern it, how much money should

357
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:39,340
be put into it. These are the kind of questions I would be asking. To be asking a question of

358
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:46,620
what should replace it in the abstract, to me, doesn't make a lot of sense without first posing

359
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,940
the questions about why, for whom, and with what purpose. You already mentioned different functions

360
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,980
of what markets supposedly can do. What are the functions that you think that should be replaced?

361
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,580
I think you already hinted towards that maybe all of them could be replaced, but what are the ones

362
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:11,420
that we should pick up first? And what then are the concrete infrastructures, the concrete

363
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:19,340
modes of engagement that we can develop in order to bring about alternative mechanisms? Maybe you

364
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,100
could give us examples for alternatives that go beyond the timetable that we already know,

365
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:32,380
but maybe a hint towards examples that, for example, can be scaled in different forms in

366
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:40,460
order to provide modes of engagement that are able to replace certain functions of the market.

367
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,580
Maybe you could guide us through different aspects of this.

368
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,100
Sure. Look, from the three functions of the market I've outlined and mentioned,

369
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:00,220
it's obvious to me that I am that opposed to making the market the overall infrastructure

370
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:06,220
of modernity, if you will. So I don't want the market to be the tool through which we

371
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:13,660
move and advance forward. I think it's a completely mad bet to do it this way. So clearly,

372
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:21,100
markets should not be instruments of reducing complexity, of organizing different types of

373
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:28,460
coordination among social groups, of allowing new things to be discovered in a structured way.

374
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:36,700
Now, am I against markets as allocative devices in certain limited cases? No, I'm not. I think

375
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:44,220
markets, once they are well-designed and once they are supervised, controlled, and

376
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:51,100
monitored, they can deliver. And you know what to expect of them once you know what to expect of

377
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,220
them. And once you monitor for how well they're functioning, you can have them all you want.

378
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:08,300
With this very limited, if you will, focus, this very limited agenda. Now, beyond that,

379
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,780
I don't have the great technocratic

380
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,500
vision, because I don't think that division here should be technocratic. I think it should be

381
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:31,180
managerial. And this is kind of another dimension that I didn't really make clear in my previous

382
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:39,740
essays, which I will make clear in the book. So I think of traditional socialist in the European

383
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,580
sense of the world at least, and the kind of European, traditional European social democratic

384
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:52,300
movement, socialism, this workers movement and communism as well. I think of it as a movement

385
00:33:52,300 --> 00:34:01,180
that in the economic sphere seeks simplicity. And planning is one way to get at it. So you

386
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:09,180
really want to make sure that things are under control and that you kind of know what goes where

387
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:15,500
and control the inputs, you can monitor the outputs. It's a system that you might think is

388
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,180
complex, but you're trying to make it simple. And you're using all sorts of tools, technologies,

389
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:30,220
techniques of knowledge and so forth to arrive at that simplicity. Capitalists, even Keynesians,

390
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:39,100
don't have this view. They accept by and large that the system is complex. And they think that

391
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:48,700
you can find ways to strive in the complexity. Corporations do that by essentially hiring

392
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:55,660
managers who go through, I mean, I know everybody, people think corporations are under idiots. I

393
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:02,460
don't. I think that good management is a craft and you have to learn it. And it requires all

394
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:09,420
sorts of techniques. I mean, try building a complex tunnel somewhere if you do it. I mean,

395
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,860
of course the government does it too. That's not the point I'm making. All I'm trying to say is

396
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:21,260
that something like project management requires a certain skill set, which you develop and then you

397
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:30,460
deal with complexity. But you deal with complexity without trying to make it simple by reducing it

398
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,660
into chunks that your system can digest, which I think is the default socialist temptation.

399
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,580
So whatever alternative system you would be building, I would suggest it becomes much more

400
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:54,780
managerial in its outlook than whatever the other equivalent was this insistence on simplicity is

401
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,540
and would be. And that means that the infrastructures we would need would need

402
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:08,140
to make it easier to manage things. So it might need infrastructures of prediction, of modeling,

403
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,820
of running simulations, of understanding how the world might be, because that's what managers do.

404
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:20,300
They try to anticipate the world as complex as it is without making it simpler. And I would

405
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,700
argue that the socialists have to go even further than that. They have to deliberately

406
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:31,020
make it more complex. So they have to take it upon themselves to make sure that the world is messier,

407
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,980
more chaotic and crazier than it is before they started working. I mean, many socialists succeed

408
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,020
in that just because of bad management. But I would argue that that has to be done structurally.

409
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:49,020
And this is what socialism is about. It's about allowing people who want to live in ways that they

410
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:55,660
want outside of the market, outside of whatever mentality and subjectivity is imposed on them by

411
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,980
this invisible Leviathan, as some people call the market, to pursue their projects without hopefully

412
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:11,500
hurting each other, but in a way that allows us to have all this immense variety of behaviors,

413
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,060
lifestyles, forms of lives, however you want to call it. And still making sure that the ship doesn't

414
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,660
think and making sure that the ship doesn't think is what really makes it complex. But this is really

415
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:32,780
where technology, big data and everything else can help, but not help by planning in the old

416
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:41,580
sense of the world, but predicting and managing and then delegating the functions farther down

417
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:49,580
the line so that you don't have to centralize all the management in the hands of the Politburo.

418
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:57,020
Now, this is how it works in the abstract. I'm not naive enough to think that in today's geopolitical

419
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:05,020
milieu, you can have as much decentralization as I would wish personally, because even developing

420
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,700
all these infrastructures of prediction, anticipation and management would require the pursuit of

421
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,180
probably a far more autonomous technology and science policy that

422
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:27,740
hegemonic powers of today would be happy with. So it will be a trade-off. So I'm not naively

423
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:33,420
proposing that we just have a bunch of communes interrelated with each other through a giant

424
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:40,620
network, but I think as a kind of as a horizon of where we want to be, that's not a bad vision.

425
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,060
In preparation for our conversation today, I listened to all of the six

426
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:55,180
Macy lectures by Stafford P. on designing freedom, and a lot of what you just said

427
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,900
kind of resonates with some of the ideas that we know from the work of Stafford P.

428
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:07,020
And I would like to kind of make a link to that, because when it comes to examples for

429
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,460
large-scale techno-political infrastructures from the left that have tried to provide alternatives

430
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,260
to both capitalist market economies and hierarchical central planning, one particular historical

431
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:25,500
experiment, of course, sticks out in different ways, and that is Project CyberSyn. You've worked

432
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,460
on the topic extensively in different formats, among them a soon-to-be-released podcast series

433
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:39,260
that I very much look forward to hearing. I guess many of the future history's listeners know about

434
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,660
Project CyberSyn, but some might not. So could you for a start give us an overview of what Project

435
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:52,460
CyberSyn is, and then go into how it is relevant for your thinking about alternatives today?

436
00:39:52,460 --> 00:40:02,300
It's a good question. I don't think, well, I mean, I'm going to disappoint you.

437
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,260
What?

438
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:13,260
So I don't think that Project CyberSyn itself is necessarily very relevant, because essentially,

439
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,500
I mean, if you really want to be honest historically, you have to take it for what it was.

440
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:26,380
And what it was, was a system that would allow a ministry, essentially, or a state-run

441
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:33,020
state corporation to run a bunch of companies that were being nationalized in a way that would be

442
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:41,020
scalable. So that's all it was. And it wasn't some great insight that we need to move from

443
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:48,460
central planning to managerialism of the kind I was describing. It was just the circumstances

444
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:53,180
were like that. They couldn't move to central planning, even if they wanted to, and they couldn't

445
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,900
exit the market because of the political conjuncture on the ground in Chile. So they were stuck with

446
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:04,620
these companies buying and selling things on the market, but being state companies that needed to

447
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:12,220
be managed in a way that would soon involve the workers, and nobody really knew how exactly that

448
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:21,100
would happen. So this is CyberSyn. This doesn't mean that the ideas circulating in that milieu

449
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:29,180
don't have anything to recommend us. I think they do. Not necessarily ideas about cybernetics,

450
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,220
but ideas about technological dependence and the way in which technology plays a

451
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,260
certain role in geopolitical order. And this is actually the focus of my Morrison work,

452
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:48,060
looking at Chile and, to some extent, Brazil of the 60s and 70s. But in Stafford Beer himself,

453
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:58,700
there are many elements that are interesting and that I think can and should be integrated

454
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:06,940
with a certain type of socialism. But it's a certain type of socialism that I think itself

455
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:14,140
is in a minority position. And it's a socialism that really looks at

456
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:27,420
complexity as a good thing. And it tries to embrace non-neoliberal complexity

457
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:35,580
and live with it and profit from it. And I would say that people like Raymond Williams, for example,

458
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:41,260
who is one of the people who has actually written about complexity in socialism and how socialists

459
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:50,460
shouldn't system complexity, is somebody who could have had a very interesting engagement

460
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,900
with cybernetics. And to some extent, he did. He was a theorist of communication and transport,

461
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,420
in addition to being a socialist and transportation. Well, more communication, of course,

462
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:08,300
much more than transportation and culture. But having studied Stafford Beer very closely,

463
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,020
having spoken to many of his friends and colleagues and family and having spent a lot of time in his

464
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:23,020
archives, I also don't want to overstate the case. He was a management theorist who mostly, by luck

465
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:29,340
and misfortune, probably more than luck, and for him ended up working in Chile of Allende,

466
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:37,260
and that changed his life. But it was not a conscious effort to think through for a decade

467
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:45,340
of how do we rebuild socialism through cybernetics. That wasn't it. It doesn't mean that there weren't

468
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:50,460
other people who have tried to think this question, and there have been some. But Stafford Beer is

469
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:58,140
essentially a person who is a management theorist. And it doesn't mean that you cannot apply his

470
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:05,500
management theory to other domains. And I think that's what happened in Chile. He had a fan club

471
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,900
and they reached out to him. But even if they did not reach out to him, they would be pursuing

472
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,940
his ideas in government there, I'm absolutely sure. So it's a body of thought that you can apply

473
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,740
in domains that have nothing to do with corporations.

474
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:27,820
And I think this is the part of cybernetics that remains relevant. And I was just reading

475
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,100
a project management book the other day. I'm sorry, I'm reading really advanced project management

476
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:39,980
books in search for some deeper truth. And they almost use the same language. They talk about

477
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,340
variability and they need to control variability where Stafford Beer would be talking about

478
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,540
variety reduction and things like that. So I think a lot of this man, they talk about buffering.

479
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:59,340
I mean, it's all very cybernetic in its outlook. So from that end, I think for obvious reasons,

480
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:05,900
the legacy of people like Stafford Beer lives on in the business world. Partly because,

481
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,460
and this is where I think maybe I agree with what you said before, partly because

482
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:18,940
socialist praxis of management and administration hasn't really flourished, even though there have

483
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:24,220
been efforts. I don't know if you know what Stefano Harni was doing with Queen Mary University in

484
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,340
London, maybe 10 or 15 years ago. There was an effort to actually take over a business school

485
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:37,100
and reorient it towards leftist Italian autonomous principles. So this efforts have

486
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,940
occurred. And sorry, maybe I shouldn't have seen you last Stefano Harni. I don't know if he'll now

487
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:47,260
be hunted down somewhere if he's in Singapore or wherever he is. But essentially,

488
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:57,820
yeah, the socialist praxis has not had a chance to learn from it in part because

489
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:05,500
there has been a shortage of socialist regimes that would truly benefit from it.

490
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:14,700
Because part of Beer's agenda, if you read those lectures carefully and if you read his books

491
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,380
carefully, is of course, sorry, should I get controversial and start talking religion?

492
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,820
It's almost like the principle of subsidiarity in Catholicism, where you could basically delegate

493
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:33,820
and you want this individual social bodies and units of society to deal with their own problems

494
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:38,460
as much as they can before you involve the church and the state, especially the state.

495
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,860
Stafford moved between different religions and eventually he left all of them. But at some point,

496
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:51,020
he was really profoundly Catholic. And I think it partly reflects how he ended up thinking about

497
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,340
autonomy because for him, autonomy inside a company, it's that it's making sure that you

498
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:02,380
have these units that are on their own and buying their own business and the higher ups intervene

499
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:09,500
only when something goes wrong. And of course, it has all sorts of issues with it. And it's,

500
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,500
one can say it is an appealing vision of how you can organize society in a kind of non-statist form.

501
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:23,180
It's just that the kind of socialists that survived the onslaught of global capitalism against them

502
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,100
in the last 30 or 40 years have not been decentralized, but rather if you look at China,

503
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:36,860
they have been centralized. And one can as well argue that had Stafford's ideas in Chile about

504
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:44,060
decentralization and autonomy been implemented faster and sooner, it would have crumbled even

505
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,620
earlier than three years in the regime of Allende, in part because

506
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:57,100
it would be very hard for such a regime to survive longer than it did without either

507
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:03,180
mobilizing all the power that you have. And instead of talking about democracy, giving

508
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,820
ordinary people arms, which would have led to a Guatemala-like civil war with

509
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:15,580
hundreds of thousands of people dead, or you just forget about all the decentralization and

510
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:21,180
autonomy altogether and you just have a China-style centralized regime and you don't have all the

511
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,220
benefits of participatory democracy, but maybe you'll last longer than three years when you

512
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:33,580
avoid the coup. So I think we have to be also a bit historically conscious and pragmatic about

513
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:39,180
this question. But what does this then mean for the alternative that you are thinking about?

514
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:45,580
Because both in terms of this relationship between center and centralized and decentralized

515
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:54,780
elements, as well as with regard to the real challenge of not getting crushed,

516
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,860
as you just described it. So what does this mean for the project that you're imagining?

517
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,620
Sure. But I think I made it clear in my initial remarks that the kind of project and vision would

518
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:13,340
require, for it to survive, it would require still a much more centralized, central entity

519
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:19,580
with a very robust science and technology policy, with a very robust intelligence network, with a

520
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:27,500
very robust geopolitical outlook, alliances and so forth, to survive in order to pursue those reforms

521
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:35,020
and to pursue this project. About that, I have zero doubt I have about that. Still, I do think

522
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:41,020
that this utopian vision does need to be communicated and put at the center of the discussion,

523
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:49,820
because ultimately, I don't think that you can win over the population, at least in Western Europe

524
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:58,620
and North America, and some parts of Latin America, maybe, with the old socialist ideas,

525
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:06,140
and all socialists are kind of imaginary. And without having those people on your side,

526
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:11,980
your project will crumble even sooner. I don't think that that necessarily is the case

527
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:18,540
when you talk about countries that we used to refer to as developing or the Global South,

528
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,900
where I do still think that there are still important tasks to be done with regards to

529
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:29,100
industrialization and with regards to essentially making sure that they avoid all the traps of

530
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:41,500
underdevelopment, and where traditional 20th century socialist rhetoric is not just working,

531
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:48,140
but probably is what they need before they can move to this more, if you want to use a

532
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,940
fancy word, post-industrial kind of imaginary I'm toying with.

533
00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:00,540
So, do you think about this question of transition in more concrete terms? Like,

534
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:07,180
what are the elements of power that one needs to think about in order to bring this about?

535
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,620
So, is this something that you think about?

536
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:18,460
I mean, we can't think about it. I'm just not sure it's of any use.

537
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,260
Oh, really?

538
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:28,540
At this point, the question is, you either try to convince the old agents of the left,

539
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:35,020
social democratic parties, trade unions, socialist parties, that this is an agenda

540
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:40,700
worth engaging with, or you just start a somewhat different movement and you try to,

541
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,820
I mean, we haven't even touched upon the question of class and what kind of class

542
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:51,980
relations emerge from this outlook. And there is a can of worms right there.

543
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:58,140
But thinking about the question of transition to me is premature, because I'm just not sure

544
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:05,180
that the political agent capable of even initiating that transition is there.

545
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,460
And I'm not sure that the current coalition, if you will, that still represents the mainstream

546
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:20,060
left, wants to take this on for all sorts of reasons. It's just not obvious how you're going

547
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:25,980
to win elections with this program. A lot of things. I mean, I think that framed properly,

548
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:37,660
you can. And to me, the number one factor is that capitalism for all its markets,

549
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:41,340
you know, however you want to frame it, but let's talk about capitalism. Capitalism for

550
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:47,820
all of the things that neoliberals say about its ability to coordinate information,

551
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,740
promote social coordination, discover new, facilitate becoming, it still does,

552
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:04,780
it still exercises so much power about alternative ways of doing things, of engaging with the world

553
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:11,100
and each other on ways that are not mediated by the market, of accessing knowledge that gets

554
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:16,380
suppressed and underdeveloped because somebody moves into that domain and grabs all the property

555
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:22,060
rights, intellectual property rights, and doesn't allow others to get in. I mean, the costs of

556
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:27,820
living under capitalism are much bigger than we think they are just in terms of kind of

557
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:37,100
imaginative power that we are losing by relying on it to be the central infrastructure of modernity,

558
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:45,740
if you will. And it would have been fine. We could live under this yoke forever, but we also have a

559
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:51,180
climate problem. And ultimately, if it don't solve that one, everybody's going to die. And

560
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:59,580
just very simple. And to me, that seems like the argument as to why anybody in their right mind

561
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:06,780
should be lining up for a political project that would remove that yoke and not just remove it

562
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:13,260
and replace it with nothing, but will actually target the very area where capitalism is weakest,

563
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,380
which I think is innovation. So in that sense, I do think that the main problem with capitalism is

564
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:25,500
that it forces society to under innovate, which in a sense is what Marx said of it in his critique.

565
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:30,940
The point was not that it's bad. It's that it innovates, but then it reaches a certain point

566
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,660
at which point class relations block it from innovating further and they're kind of stuck.

567
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,860
So you don't have to say that Marxist was an accelerationist. That was the whole point of

568
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:48,220
Marxist critique of capitalism as a modern system. And I think back in those days,

569
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:55,660
it seemed that the only thing we were losing was just maybe fancy and better technologies

570
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,540
or more efficient ways of organization. But now we're losing our future because

571
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:08,380
we're just going to die in the climate catastrophe. And if we don't move, then it will come faster.

572
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,460
So in that sense, you may start making new political arguments

573
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:19,740
that will somehow bring themes of knowledge, innovation, climate change, catastrophe,

574
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:27,100
all in one place. But I just don't see... So let's leave aside the hardcore left,

575
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,900
focus on the social Democrats. Social Democrats accept the mainstream neoliberal story about the

576
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:37,180
markets being good for knowledge and that they are the perfect systems for knowledge coordination

577
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:44,460
and they are perfect system for essentially making use of all the knowledge that's distributed

578
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:50,140
in society, to use one of Hayek's phrases. And it's just false. So for them to accept the story

579
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:55,340
I'm advancing, they'll just need to do some work on themselves and essentially understand that they've

580
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:02,940
made some mistakes. And then there is a space and a way to think about these questions without having

581
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:10,460
to say, no, we are with Stalin and with centralized central planning of the Soviet Union. And until

582
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,300
they do that, I don't think we should even be talking about transition.

583
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:21,340
It's so interesting to me that you put this aspect of discovery so much at center stage,

584
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:29,020
because my intuition would be that what you already pointed towards like the ecological question,

585
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:37,260
as well as the question of existential security, those are the ones that are, in my view,

586
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:44,860
much more important for a broader public. You could easily argue for a discovery through

587
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:51,500
existential security, since if you simply bring people into the position where they do not have to

588
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:59,660
hustle the whole day in order just to get through, then there's a huge potential of

589
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,420
creativity, so to speak, that would be set free.

590
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,660
But intellectually, I understand what you're saying. And a lot of people have made that

591
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,900
case with regards to the welfare state. But I just think that intellectually,

592
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,660
I mean, look, it's a much bigger battle than a battle between sort of neoliberalism and

593
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:26,620
whatever succeeds the people who win the socialist calculation debate. Essentially, it's a question,

594
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:32,380
it's a debate about action. You have a theory of action underpinning, I would argue,

595
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:39,820
both neoclassical economics and Austrian economics, to some extent, and much of social science,

596
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:46,300
to some extent, and much of social science, things like rational choice, which is a very

597
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:52,860
simplistic theory of action. And, you know, it starts with Weber, who partly borrows it from

598
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:58,300
Menger and a bunch of other economists of the first generation Austrian school. And it goes

599
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:03,820
something like this, you know, we're all rational, we have goals, then we find the most rational ways

600
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:11,500
of fulfilling them. And then that's it. And if we find a more efficient way of fulfilling them,

601
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:17,580
then this is innovation. And the person who does that is an entrepreneur. And what it is

602
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:24,940
to be an entrepreneur is to be always on the lookout for the more efficient means of pursuing

603
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:30,780
given ends. And that's a theory of action that I would argue, and I'm not the only one making

604
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:37,180
that case, underpins most of the theories of socialism in the actual praxis in the Soviet

605
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:42,300
Union and elsewhere. So, you know, Lange and everybody else, that's how they also think about

606
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,740
action. But this is wrong. I mean, this is wrong, because it doesn't account for people changing

607
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:53,660
goals along the way. And it doesn't account for much of the stuff that happens in everyday life.

608
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,460
I start doing something, I do it, then I understand I need to do something else. And I do it differently.

609
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,460
Then I realize it's all wrong, I need to do something else entirely. This is what human

610
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:08,540
action is like. And unless you build a political system that accounts for it, you're going to end

611
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:14,460
up wasting 90% of human potential and human creativity, what really makes us humans as opposed

612
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:21,900
to automatons and algorithms. Because our social system is not optimized to take advantage of the

613
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,140
sparks of creativity that really drive us and that make us human. And the only way that our

614
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:34,860
system currently is optimized to do that is by channeling our desires and incentives into the

615
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:40,220
price system. So if I really understand that there is something cool to be done and creative, yes,

616
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,700
and I want to share it with others. The only way to do that for me is to become an entrepreneur,

617
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,860
start a startup, seek money and put it on the market. And all I'm saying is that if we were

618
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,220
to build an alternative system that would actually account for how humans really are,

619
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,540
it would require very different theories of action, maybe informed by pragmatism,

620
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:06,460
maybe informed by something else. There are tons of, not tons, but some alternatives out there,

621
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:13,420
abduction. I mean, you can account for all sorts of things, which mainstream economic and social

622
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:20,140
theory cannot account for. Once you build an appropriate social system for that, then I think

623
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:27,500
the effects and the benefits you're going to harvest will go far beyond what you get by

624
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:32,620
currently making sure that artists have universal basic income or the welfare state is generous and

625
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:40,620
our funds arts. That's what I'm talking about. And in that sense, I don't think we are there.

626
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,140
And I don't think that people on the left are even interested in this question. And I think they

627
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:50,620
completely... Yeah, well, I don't know. You disagree? Tell me. Maybe there are some underground

628
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:57,020
circles that I'm not aware of. Well, I mean, I think that people are interested in so far as

629
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:03,340
I think there's a similarity of the way that you pose the problem to a certain kind of

630
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:11,740
not disappointment, but yeah, maybe it is a form of disappointment how the debate around

631
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:17,100
democratic economic planning is currently framed. Because in my view, at least, even though I'm very

632
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:23,180
much interested in the debate, obviously, I do think that it's a far too narrow scope that is

633
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:29,660
being talked about within this debate. And in so far, I think there is an interest in going beyond

634
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:39,100
this like fixation on markets as information processes, which is a scope that is not big

635
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:44,540
enough. And the way that I try to approach this is through this lens of alternative arts of

636
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:52,780
government, which is a way for me to ask different questions towards this complex of problems.

637
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:59,500
And for me, for example, this leads to questions of markets as sites of veridiction and production

638
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:06,540
of truth and stuff like that. And then you come to different, as I said, a different set of questions

639
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:13,420
and a different set of problems that we need to kind of engage with and bring up alternative

640
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:20,060
ways to approach it. So I would say there is an interest in thinking about these things in

641
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:26,380
different ways. I think I do have maybe a different timetable in terms of I would say the first thing

642
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:33,020
would be to provide some form of universal basic service and existential security.

643
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:40,540
And then on top of that, we should build these different kind of infrastructures of discovery,

644
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:47,820
so to speak, because I think that they can only be harnessed if the material basis is given for the

645
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:53,740
people who have to have basically time in order to engage with it. And so this is a different

646
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:01,020
kind of timeline. But I mean, it's not just the timeline. I mean, look, I fundamentally think

647
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:08,380
that social theory accepted in mainstream leftist circles is broken.

648
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,860
And it just is. And it's broken because the theory of action underpinning it is broken.

649
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,580
And unless you fix it, you're not going to have a robust theory that will be able to speak about

650
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:27,020
modernity, industrialization, postmodernism, whatever you want. You may say none of it is

651
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:32,300
relevant. We just want to make sure that people have tramps and enough food to eat.

652
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:37,340
And that's fine. That's a fun perspective to take. It's not either or. I just don't think,

653
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:45,180
well, sure, it's not either. Yeah, but if it's not neither or, then you're asking for the kind of

654
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:50,540
low-hanging fruit. I mean, who is going to argue on the left against universal basic services

655
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:57,900
or universal basic income, like continue to constitute it in a kind of way that will be

656
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:06,700
welfare state enhancing as opposed to libertarian Friedmanesque. So I see it as a default. To me,

657
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:12,780
that's not even an issue, to be honest. To me, the issue is that even if you engage with the

658
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:20,300
German-speaking world and you take somebody like Jurgen Habermas, he is the reference point

659
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:28,140
for German social democracy, whether you want it or not. Habermas does have a theory of action.

660
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:31,660
And the theory of action is very simple. The theory of action tells you the world is getting

661
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:36,940
more and more complex. In that sense, he agrees with Hayek and Luhman. And he tells you the only

662
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:43,340
way to reduce that complexity is by relying on markets and by relying on law, so money and legal

663
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:49,020
system. There is nothing else. And then all you can do is to eventually and sometimes push back

664
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,820
against the encroachments of all that complexity on the life world. And you do that through

665
01:04:53,820 --> 01:05:00,140
traditional liberal institutions and the media. And that's a story accepted by and large by social

666
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:06,940
democracy. Now, is that story true? I would argue that story is not true for one simple reason,

667
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:12,940
because he's missing the most important mechanism of social coordination and reducing complexity,

668
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:18,460
which is information technology. And that you don't need to rely on

669
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:25,180
money and you don't need to rely on law. You can actually reduce complexity. And once you understand

670
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:30,380
that, then you understand that all sorts of other things become possible. You don't really need to

671
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:35,660
buy all of the bourgeois liberal political institutions we inherited from the French

672
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:41,740
Revolution whole scale, because you can have people organizing and still having all the

673
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,540
complexity that you want and all of the rights that they want, but doing it outside of the

674
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:52,860
traditional money system with banks and legal system with laws and bureaucracies. And I think

675
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:59,900
that unless, and that's just one example. So unless you go and piece by piece understand

676
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:07,180
what are the blocks, mental blocks and intellectual blocks, we're going to end up reusing and recycling

677
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:13,660
neoliberalism. Because to some extent for when it comes to non-communicative action in Habermas,

678
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:19,100
that's what he does. He takes Hayek and he basically says, yeah, life is getting more complex.

679
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:24,140
But what I mean by recycling neoliberalism is something very simple. The only way you account

680
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:30,700
for these creative sparks of action that I was describing 10 minutes or five minutes before

681
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,260
in mainstream debate is through the concept of entrepreneurship.

682
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,220
And now you have to invent all sorts of entrepreneurship. We have moral entrepreneurship,

683
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:45,420
ideas entrepreneurship, cultural entrepreneurship, religious, everything is entrepreneurship now,

684
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:53,260
because we have no way to account for truly new creative non-teleological behavior

685
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,020
in domains that are not the market. So we think everything is like the market. So we're going to

686
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:01,980
take the Austrian concept of entrepreneurship from it and insert it everywhere else in social

687
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:07,500
theory and how the world operates. And I think it's just dumb. And that will continue spreading

688
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:13,660
unless somebody stands up and says, look, you're basically working with the wrong concept because

689
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:19,100
the Austrian concept of entrepreneurship doesn't even describe entrepreneurship itself,

690
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,100
because it cannot tell you about entrepreneurs that suddenly decide to, I don't know,

691
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,380
switch from for-profit to non-profit status, pursue social entrepreneurship or completely

692
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,540
change their goals or completely reinvent themselves. You're still tied to the idea

693
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:37,900
that these people need to make something and that they're imprisoned by the price system.

694
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,500
And the only innovations they can introduce is in the techniques of production,

695
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,940
which is how traditionally they think. So you can switch to a better technology. You can invent

696
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:51,340
something or you can invent a new product that will be even better than your previous product.

697
01:07:51,340 --> 01:08:01,180
So all I'm saying is that I think it's not either or and that I agree with you, but I do think that

698
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:08,780
without completely rebuilding social theory block by block to account for complex behavior,

699
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:14,460
to account for complex behavior, that's not just Santa Fe Institute like complexity theory,

700
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,660
whose whole purpose and there is own debtor, as far as I'm concerned, is to show you that

701
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:27,100
the state can never be as good as the market and kicking off economic processes,

702
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:34,700
like we need a different complexity. We need a non-neoliberal complexity favorable to the core

703
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:41,260
leftist ideals and ideas. And some of those ideas have to do with a diversity of lifestyle

704
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:48,220
and diversity of life forms producing fantastic social effects that will be disruptive, progressive,

705
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,620
and it will move society forward. The kind of effects that we currently attribute to the market.

706
01:08:53,740 --> 01:09:00,780
And now you mentioned again that one of the tools that we definitely need to use that is

707
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:07,580
in our toolbox, but is not yet utilized in order to bring this alternatives about our digital

708
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:15,260
technologies. Can you sketch in a bit more concrete terms how specifically digital technologies can be

709
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:24,940
of use in this task? Yeah, but again, you will find it very banal. And that's all right. No,

710
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:30,300
no, no, but I just don't think that it's look, I'm the kind of guy who 10 years ago was putting the

711
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,180
word internet and scare quotes. And that's how I put it in my book to save everything click here,

712
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:40,300
because I didn't think that there was such a thing and that it needed to be talked about and be

713
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:47,260
ascribed all sorts of essential qualities as if it was, I don't know, something that is born with

714
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:53,180
this features and characteristics. So in that sense, if one community will be happy to use

715
01:09:53,180 --> 01:10:01,660
abacus and a timetable, and another one would want an AI, I mean, great. Like it's not up for me to

716
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:07,900
like all I think all we can do as critical intellectuals is to look at the current tech

717
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:16,060
landscape and to see which parts of it make such a project unlikely or not favorable, right, both

718
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:21,580
in terms of use, because you can say that, okay, this technologies are easy to spy on, they allow

719
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:28,300
surveillance, they, they require people to pay for them with their data with money. So you can make a

720
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:36,940
critique based on use and praxis, so to say, or you can make a critique based on what the non state

721
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:43,260
ownership of this infrastructures in the current economic conjuncture means geopolitically,

722
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:51,020
because you want your basic communication, education, health care, transportation,

723
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:57,420
to be somehow run in a democratic way, where the policy decides on how to offer it, how to structure

724
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:03,500
it, how to reform it, which you would not be able to do if you integrate volunteer into your,

725
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,460
you know, health data, and you will not be able then to kick them back for all sorts of other

726
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:13,020
reasons, contractually and infrastructurally, right, so that this is a different side of this

727
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,500
is a different critique. There has nothing to do with praxis, because you can even buy into it and

728
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:23,260
say that Google offers you a fantastic tool, like a Google Calendar, great, we'll never invent

729
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:29,740
something better. You can even accept that argument on the level of use and praxis, but you can then

730
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:35,180
strike it down and strike it out based on the geopolitical meaning of delegating so much power

731
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:42,140
to a foreign company that you cannot control. So see, I think that these are the criteria

732
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:49,020
through which this has to be thought through. But beyond that, I just think you will end up

733
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:54,380
at a level of generality that will tell you that yes, overall, it's better to have infrastructures

734
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:00,860
that are generative. So you can build on them in an easier way than infrastructures that aren't

735
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:05,500
and that are closed. This is the truth we've learned in the last 50 or 60 years. Is it always

736
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,220
the case? No, because there are tradeoffs. And some of those tradeoffs may have to do with security,

737
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:16,220
with the fact that you just don't have access to technologies because somebody is not selling them

738
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:22,780
to you, which now is happening in China with microchips. And this is a constraint. And then

739
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:28,380
you have to live with that constraint. So I don't really think that you can arrive at a

740
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,820
beyond that, I don't think you can arrive at a set of more specific, at least I cannot,

741
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:39,100
at a set of more specific normative criteria that you want to have in this tech infrastructure.

742
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:44,300
Because ultimately, it has to be secondary to a political project. And unless you have

743
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,740
a political project, this infrastructure is not going to help.

744
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:54,940
Yeah, absolutely. And I'm actually very much looking forward to the way in which you will

745
01:12:54,940 --> 01:13:01,100
hopefully lay out these ideas in your in your book at some point. Do you know when this will be ready?

746
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,820
Good question. You're not the only one asking me this question.

747
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:12,540
So now after two years, I'm almost done with this podcast on letter America. So I'm getting

748
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:17,820
back to the book. I think that the podcast has helped me a lot to sharpen

749
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:26,540
some of my points, particularly with regards to this managerial angle simulations modeling,

750
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:30,460
and the role that they can play in alternative leftist project on paradigm.

751
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:39,180
So my hope is to finally finish this book this summer. And if all goes well should be out next

752
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:45,580
year. Nice. Very much looking forward. Did it bring you the podcast project? Did it bring you

753
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:54,300
forward in terms of thinking about the political project as well? Yes and no. I mean, it was a

754
01:13:54,300 --> 01:14:03,580
project very much focused on Latin America and the Caribbean. So in the 60s and 1970s. And

755
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:10,300
so it's a very different time with the Cold War and multinational corporations and spy agencies.

756
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:22,620
So it did in a sense that you see, you see how a lot of the challenges and problems that a country

757
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:27,260
like China is going through right now, for example, when it comes to technological sovereignty and

758
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:35,260
its desire to break from the technological dependence on Western Europe and North America,

759
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:43,420
how these debates already were had in the 60s and 70s and how in a sense,

760
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:50,060
China is doing what some Latin American countries in the end impact, for example,

761
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:57,340
where Chile and Peru were members in Ecuador, I think, that they tried to do in the late 1960s,

762
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:06,220
early 1970s. So in a sense, yes, I don't think maybe you can apply some of those lessons to Europe

763
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:14,620
too, in a sense. But I think to me, there is really no possibility of a political project

764
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:22,940
without a geopolitical project. So I think, if you will, the condition of possibility for the

765
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:28,460
kind of progressive political project that all of us are hoping for as a certain geopolitical

766
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:36,780
situation and a certain geopolitical outlook. And I don't think that we should ignore that,

767
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:45,340
that it would require a more bolder stance vis-a-vis the United States, possibly,

768
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:52,780
or at least vis-a-vis Wall Street and Silicon Valley and others. And yeah, I just don't think

769
01:15:52,780 --> 01:16:01,500
that you can have harmony while at the same time pursuing some kind of an agenda that would replace

770
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:09,260
their tack with European tack. I don't think it will be easy. And as long as it's realized, then

771
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:17,500
it's fine. Very much looking forward to this book, I have to say. Evgeny, at the end, I always ask

772
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:25,900
the question, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful? Yeah, I've listened to a podcast,

773
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:38,220
I should have prepared for this question. What makes me joyful? I mean, ultimately, I think that

774
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:55,660
there are, how should I put it? Yeah, I know, I don't really know. So nothing makes me joyful

775
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:02,380
in the very specific sense, because I think optimism is the kind of luxury that we cannot

776
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:12,060
really afford at this point. But let me think about it some more. Well, I mean, I don't want to sound

777
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:18,300
like one of those accelerationist guys and celebrating the power of technology to solve

778
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:25,820
all these questions. But I do think that if there is a silver lining, yeah, that's the right term,

779
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:33,020
silver lining, to the kind of rise of big tack in the last 10, well, in the last 15 or 20 years,

780
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:45,420
it's that it showed us that so much social coordination is possible in a completely

781
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:50,940
non-market way. And we have not realized that yet. I mean, if you think about all the tools,

782
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:56,300
all the apps, that all these people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere obsessed with productivity,

783
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:01,420
with collaboration and coordination are using. I mean, yes, you might be paying something for them.

784
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:06,860
But what they probably don't realize is that ultimately, they're not coordinating through

785
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:11,820
the price system. I mean, they're using the price system to get access to a non-market system of

786
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:18,220
coordination. And Silicon Valley has consistently showing us that collaboration and coordination

787
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,980
happens outside of the market. And with enough money being poured into it,

788
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:29,900
it can become even deeper and better and faster and more efficient. And in that sense,

789
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:38,300
that is the best argument against relying on the market to facilitate social coordination

790
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:44,460
a la Hayek that we have seen. And that does make me optimistic, but that requires

791
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,540
somebody to see. And if a tree falls in the forest, then there is nobody to see it.

792
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:59,340
So if people will be able to see that element of it, great. But I think right now, the only

793
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:04,220
thing we have seen in this phenomenon, by and large in the public debate, is the opposite,

794
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:11,900
is the idea that the market is so much better than the non-market building these cool things.

795
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:19,580
And to some extent, I mean, it's not true, but they have built them. But that's not the point.

796
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,820
The point is what these things allow us to do and what they allow us to do is to completely

797
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:30,300
bypass the market when it comes to coordinating. And as long as you understand that, then you're

798
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:36,220
fired. That's so interesting that you frame it this way now at the end again, because I think

799
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:44,140
that, I mean, leaving aside the too narrow focus within the debate, at least this point that you

800
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:51,420
just stated, I think this is absolutely part of the like revived planning debate, that there is

801
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:59,340
potential in these types of non-market coordination, at least in future histories. This features

802
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:06,540
definitely features in future histories, I would say, no? The fact that these technologies do

803
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:12,140
provide some form of alternative coordination. Sure, sure, sure. But the question, I think this

804
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:18,380
is Jan, gets us to the heart of it. The question then becomes, what do you need this coordination

805
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:26,300
for? And I think that this is a philosophical question. And for a lot of people, including,

806
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:31,500
I would say most of the people involved in the democratic planning debate, this coordination

807
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:36,300
is just a way of fulfilling the need to distribute and allocate goods

808
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:44,220
by and large, because this is the primary focus, right? They're not really stepping into the world

809
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:49,900
of discovery, becoming creativity and so forth. Because ultimately, it's almost like they operate

810
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,460
with a Maslow pyramid of some kind, right? And this is what, for many people, that's what,

811
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:59,820
Marx operates with it to some extent, too. So if you look at this kind of the distinction,

812
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,660
and I mentioned it in some of my talks, you heard that the distinction in the realm of necessity,

813
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,020
what is it? The realm of necessity and the realm of freedom, right? Ultimately,

814
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:18,220
even if you want to be 100% just to Marx, you have to acknowledge that he put a lot of effort

815
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:25,020
into thinking about the realm of necessity and not enough into thinking about the realm of freedom,

816
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:34,380
right? And in a sense, because maybe it was too far into the future. Maybe it's because it's all,

817
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:39,260
maybe it would just have some kind of a liberal, I'm not saying that's what Marx wrote, but that's

818
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:44,460
one possible interpretation. Maybe we'll have some kind of a liberal interpretation of everybody to

819
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,180
their own devices. And as long as we coordinate production in the workshop in a democratic way,

820
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:54,780
what you do when you hunt and drink wine and write poetry in the afternoon,

821
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:59,260
like it doesn't matter. So we shouldn't think about it. And I think that's a mistake. So if

822
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:03,340
there is like one big message, I'd like to leave you with is that I think it's a mistake because

823
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:10,300
in a sense, the neoliberals understood that it's that element that accounts for the most exciting

824
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:16,780
parts of modernity. So this is the stuff that really gets people excited about technology,

825
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:21,820
cities, urbanization, modernization. It's that part. It's not the satisfaction of basic needs.

826
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:25,660
And they argue that the market is key to satisfying it. So this is one reason why I

827
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:31,180
think the lab should engage with planning in the realm of freedom more than it has.

828
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:38,700
And the second reason is that I do think that the realm of freedom, once organized properly,

829
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:44,220
is productive of value that can then, in the non-Marxist meaning of the term,

830
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:50,300
that can then feed back to satisfy the needs in the realm of necessities. And that's,

831
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:56,300
to some extent, what Silicon Valley has done. They allowed you to do whatever you want in your

832
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:01,660
everyday life. They get all the data through your devices about what it is that you do,

833
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:05,660
and then they monetize it. And then they do whatever they want with that money.

834
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:11,260
And so if you really want to have a socialist biopolitics, that's a good candidate.

835
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:19,100
They are appropriating that and making sure that value is generated from that,

836
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:23,260
not just individual everyday life, living your life the way you want, but also from

837
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:27,980
collectivity because we all engage in it collectively. And once analyzed collectively,

838
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:33,260
of course, this data has enormous value when it comes to traffic analysis or epidemiological

839
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:40,220
trends and so forth. But that comes from us being, I'm sorry, in the realm of freedom,

840
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,740
by and large, or at least in the realm of social reproduction, if you really want to

841
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:54,460
be middle-groundish about it. So in that sense, I do agree that the questions like this have

842
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:58,460
attracted the attention of people on the left. I just think they're asking them in the wrong register.

843
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:06,220
Intuitively, if you go to a person who is now struggling in subsistence and you ask them,

844
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:14,780
is it either the realm of necessity that should be covered first or should we immediately jump

845
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:20,300
into the realm of freedom, I'm pretty sure that the first will say, oh, please, let's start with

846
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:26,940
the realm of necessity. But again, if you were to talk longer,

847
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:34,300
I mean, I can tell you that I don't think that dichotomy is accurate. So I don't think that

848
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,460
that's the correct way to think about it. You're not going to get very far if you really pose the

849
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:44,300
question this way, because once you start with both of them separated like that, which assumes

850
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:49,580
a division between work and non-work that's very strict, that's separate, that's things that value

851
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:54,140
is produced in the workplace, of course, you're going to end up with the most obvious conclusion.

852
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:59,420
So me personally, and I think I even said it in the Berkeley talk and some other talk,

853
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:04,060
I don't think that that's a helpful way to think about it. So we need to get away from the

854
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:10,460
separation because most of the people on the left, them who did think about the realm of freedom,

855
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:17,500
they still end up saying that we need to reintroduce the realm of freedom into the realm

856
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:22,780
of necessity. The way Marcuse would, for example, he will tell you, oh, factory work should be like

857
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:31,580
a playground. And I just don't think that you're going to end up in a helpful way. But

858
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:39,340
just to counter back to what you said, if you stick with my analysis, then

859
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:44,940
you can say that, well, I mean, why is that person starving? I mean, if you really build a system

860
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:50,220
on my model, the money that currently ends up with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg will be funding

861
01:25:51,180 --> 01:26:01,580
his welfare. Because that money right now, I mean, my realm of freedom, if not his,

862
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:08,780
is being expropriated, appropriated and monetized in a way that leaves that person starving.

863
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:15,660
So why is that a trivial issue? And I don't know what the right answer is. It doesn't seem

864
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:22,380
to be trivial. It seems to me that clearly, once you understand that the rise of Big Tech,

865
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:30,220
to some extent, is linked to the ability to tap into everyday life and to tap into our social

866
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:37,020
coordination with each other and to monetize it and extract profits from it and to strip public

867
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:41,420
coffers of their avenues that would have otherwise been there, then yeah, I mean,

868
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:46,140
I don't think it's such a reasonable question to ask. So of course, that's why I was saying

869
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:51,260
earlier that I don't think that this is the right paradigm, for example, for the global south,

870
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,900
where you still probably need to be building factories and have people working there,

871
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,580
you need to industrialize, you need to build your own base, you need to recreate,

872
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:03,260
instead of relying on global supply chains, recreate some of the capacity domestically,

873
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:11,180
it will be fine with the older socialist program. So I understand the geopolitical

874
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:17,820
and regional bias, what I'm saying, but I don't think that the fact that there are,

875
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:24,860
I don't think that the fact that there are, you know, people who are poor or homeless or

876
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:31,420
who have troubles right now, which can be immediately resolved, should take off pressure

877
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:41,500
of us to find holes in legitimation strategies of neoliberals, or contribute to articulating

878
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:47,820
an alternative political project. Because the fact that people are hungry right now,

879
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:52,300
stripped of the ideological context tells you absolutely nothing, you might as well

880
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:57,740
believe that Elon Musk should give them basic income, or some philanthropist should fund

881
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:04,700
something for them. Right? So to me, the presence of evil in the world, as such,

882
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:11,340
that is easily fixable. It's no reason not to engage, which I think we both agree on that.

883
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,140
But I just want to reiterate it, because like, for me, they're not somehow,

884
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,340
one is not the reason not to think about the other.

885
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:26,700
Mm hmm. Yeah, no, no, I absolutely agree with that. Maybe it's that I

886
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:38,140
think about the ability to bring about the new in different ways. Or maybe I don't see it as

887
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:44,140
that much of a challenge. But I think I get the point you're making. At least I think I get the

888
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:49,820
point you're making in terms of providing... But that was the project for Marx, though.

889
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:57,660
So I really think that what is Marxism? Marxism is very simple. You have social relations of

890
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:01,180
production that eventually block forces of production from advancing further.

891
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:06,060
It's just a philosophy of the new. There is nothing else in Marx. That's the core idea,

892
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:12,700
it's that. And that you need to change relations of production so that the forces of production

893
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:17,900
can continue unimpeded. And you can, of course, make all sorts of cases for ecology and whatever,

894
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:23,420
and they're all important points. But ultimately, that's what it is. So I mean, the question of the

895
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:29,660
new and its sustained, almost industrial, methodological, theoretical production,

896
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:36,060
it's at the core of the leftist project. Yes, but there are a lot of questions that

897
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:41,340
are connected to that. The question of if we needed to think progressivism in a different way,

898
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:48,700
for example, I'm not sure if we can just jump into this competition, so to speak,

899
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:57,740
with the neoliberals and accept this premise in the first place of markets as the harbingers of

900
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:06,380
the production of the new, and then try to... But that's where we disagree, I think,

901
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:10,700
because I think it's just undeniable. It's undeniable. I also think phenomenologically

902
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:16,540
for the majority of the population. That's so interesting. I mean, you just need to open an

903
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:20,460
app store. I mean, don't you see all the apps? I mean, how you can possibly deny that that's

904
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,540
the production of the new? I mean, that's what people think... Well, I mean, there's an argument...

905
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:30,140
Well, there's a strong argument to make that capitalism is like the production of the ever

906
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:38,060
old in new forms. That's an argument that is out there and it has some form of plausibility

907
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:46,780
to it as well. The way in which markets and capitalism are able to produce the news is a

908
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:54,540
very, very narrow corridor in which we have this accelerated perpetuation of the old, actually,

909
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:59,740
and not really the production of the new, which is, I think, what you actually want to state,

910
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:04,860
what you are stating. So maybe we are not a part of this.

911
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:08,540
No, no, I believe in productivity improvements. So I believe that there are productivity

912
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:13,900
improvements in capitalist firms that are real. So they're not inventions. If they were just the

913
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:20,140
recycling of the old, there is no reason for capitalist firms to fake the production of

914
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:24,860
productivity improvements. Because if they do that, they're just going to be eaten alive.

915
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:29,900
In that sense, I do believe in competition. Yeah. But that's why I mentioned that it's

916
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:35,020
also important to talk about new ways of thinking about progress, because it's not only about

917
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:42,460
productivity improvements, no? Because this way of thinking, this logic has brought us into a place

918
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:48,540
where we are aiming through a catastrophe. But that's a different argument from saying

919
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:54,460
that they're repackaging the old. So I was invoking that in the sense that I don't think

920
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:57,740
they're repackaging the old, because if they're repackaging the old, they'll just be out of

921
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:01,980
business as individual capitalists. And in that sense, I think if you read somebody like Anwar

922
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:08,140
Shaikh, who I think is the Marxist economist who's done almost like his view on competition is the

923
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:13,260
same as mine and is the same to some extent as Hayek's. So competition is real and it does

924
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:19,500
produce new things, both on the consumption side and on the production side. You can make all sorts

925
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,940
of arguments. And that's partly what I'm saying, that there are other ways in which new is generated,

926
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:30,940
because there are other ways in which we coordinate. And so far, we've put all of our resources,

927
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:36,300
all of our thinking and money and laws into boosting markets as the only infrastructure

928
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:40,700
of doing that. But clearly, that's not the only infrastructure. But to me, it seems,

929
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:46,380
and we need it for all sorts of reasons that I accept have to do with redefining progress

930
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:52,140
and so forth. But to me, to deny that there is something new produced in the markets by both

931
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:58,620
producers and consumers, and that is valid. And that part of the neoliberal argument is correct,

932
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:03,820
just to me, since it's counterproductive, because it just rejects our phenomenological

933
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:10,700
everyday experience. And I see no problem in accepting that part of the story.

934
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:18,220
Yeah. Well, I mean, if you state it this way, then I wouldn't say that there is nothing new

935
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:22,460
being produced. But that's actually bringing us to a question that I wanted to ask you,

936
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:28,380
but I actually didn't, because maybe you could specify what you mean by the new. Is it just

937
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:36,380
productivity gains? So if you talk about that has to be replaced when it comes to this question of

938
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:43,020
the production of the new, what is the new? How do you define it?

939
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:47,180
Well, but I mean, does it need to be defined?

940
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,060
Well, it makes a big difference.

941
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:56,460
I mean, if you look at it in terms of practices, these are practices and ways of being and ways of

942
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:03,820
existing that were not there before when you started. I mean, we just need to introduce

943
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:11,340
a temporal element in this. And you're going to see practices and ways of doing things that

944
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:18,860
were not there before, ways of doing old things in new ways or ways of doing completely new things.

945
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:28,060
I mean, if you define it in this way, the new is being produced in many different social fields

946
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:35,580
all the time. But who's denying that? You are telling me things that are the core of my argument

947
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:40,380
and I'm trying to build an infrastructure for scaling them up and generating value out of them.

948
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:47,180
Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I think it's just that I think why we land at this position is that

949
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:54,460
I'm not sure if the thing that market competition is able to provide when it comes to

950
01:34:54,460 --> 01:35:00,220
building the new is as huge as you or it should be

951
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:07,900
problematized much more than maybe you would do it. But I think we're circling around

952
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,460
in different ways. Yeah, but it also depends. I mean, look,

953
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:18,860
it depends on what your project is. It depends on how you think about

954
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:23,340
neoliberalism. I don't think about this as an economic theory. I think about it as a

955
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:29,100
theory of modernity. I think about it as a theory of civilization, essentially. That tells you

956
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:38,780
precisely, I'm sorry to say, how do you incorporate the new into your life and into the world?

957
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:45,020
If you read Hayek, it's just there stated very clearly that, yes, he tells you there are all

958
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:49,980
sorts of effects if you put the cash nexus where you previously had social relations or family ties.

959
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:58,220
But in the long run, the pie expands and the pie expands even if certain people end up as lawyers.

960
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:03,500
And it expands precisely because this new stuff is being produced and is being produced in a

961
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:08,620
sustainable way as far as capitalism is concerned. We don't talk about climate and other things.

962
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:17,900
And this is what market civilization does. It's not about coordinated firms and consumers.

963
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:25,340
It's about bringing novelty into the world. And I don't know, like, how is that not to me?

964
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:28,620
And if you look at the legitimation of neoliberalism, that's the reason why

965
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:35,820
it's of any appeal, unless it's imposed by force. That is the most exciting part of neoliberalism,

966
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:44,220
which is so exciting that social democrats are buying into it. And if you really want to

967
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:53,580
and if you really want to unthrone it or disrone it, you need to have an alternative account

968
01:36:53,580 --> 01:37:01,580
of how society can move forward and structurally, infrastructurally produce the new in a way that

969
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:06,700
scales up. And that's not just about arts and crafts and artisanal people building things,

970
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:12,140
but that there are actually ways to interconnect people in, I don't know, Ecuador with people in

971
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:18,140
Moldova, which is what the market does and make sure the changes in one proxies then are reflected

972
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:24,540
in the life and in the proxies of the other. Ultimately, what I'm saying is that there are

973
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:33,500
infrastructures that allow people to coordinate, collaborate, produce things, whether these things

974
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:42,380
are effects or emotions or ideas or things that have all of the markings of what neoliberals

975
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:50,220
attribute to market civilization without most of the costs. And that if you, they're not developed

976
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:56,060
because public policy is such that it doesn't channel resources there. You cannot scale them

977
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:02,940
up properly. You cannot, your only turn, your only option is towards the market.

978
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:12,140
And that's why we have all these idealistic people who beyond protesting, if they really want to do

979
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:19,500
something, like what do they do? Like they form a startup and they become, you know, in most cases

980
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:24,700
and they seek money and they know that this will allow them to scale. If they don't want to be just

981
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:30,460
local operators and if they want to scale, that's what they need to do. Why? Because our entire

982
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:38,140
civilization favors the market as the default and only infrastructure of scaling up this coordination

983
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:44,380
and generating value out of it. But you can have a multiplicity of them. That's why in one of my

984
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:51,980
earlier articles in New Left Review, I basically said, look, Hayek has a flawed evolutionary theory

985
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:57,900
and what he says about how people become less altruistic as they move from villages to cities

986
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:03,740
is wrong. That evolutionary theory actually teaches us otherwise. And that you might as well say that

987
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:11,580
solidarity will be as productive, what Hayek calls discovery, as competition. It's basically like,

988
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:15,900
there is no reason to believe that he's correct on that point and I don't think he is. But it

989
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:20,620
doesn't mean that solidarity is the only thing that can do it. You can maybe list 10 values that

990
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:26,140
will do it. Maybe you can list 20 and maybe you can list infrastructures that will go along with

991
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:33,180
them to enable them and to elicit these behaviors and to elicit these orientations. So I mean,

992
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:38,300
I don't know. To me, that seems like the core question of how do you organize modernity

993
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:44,940
rather than a trivial one. It's not about making sure we have a different system for building apps.

994
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:52,700
It's a way for me of thinking about how do you move society forward and embrace the new

995
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:58,300
in a structured way that bypasses the dichotomy of the market and the state

996
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:04,620
and refuses the idea that the only way to do it in a scaled up way is by relying on the market.

997
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:09,660
I absolutely agree. I think it's maybe because maybe you are holding something back that is

998
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:13,740
in the book and in your thinking because there's something missing. I absolutely agree with

999
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:20,140
everything you just said. But for example, within capitalism, you do have private property

1000
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:28,540
as a form of guiding lens that is able to unify these actions much as the

1001
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:36,860
market as competition does. So you will have a mechanism that is able to provide a form of

1002
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:42,540
like pre-coordination maybe. And in the way that you describe the alternative,

1003
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:49,980
I think, of course, it's right to point out that there needs to be a multiplicity of different

1004
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:55,740
approaches that look at different aspects of, for example, the market, but also different

1005
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:04,300
regional contexts and stuff like that. But then still, you would have to come up with an answer

1006
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:15,340
that provides this glue, this form of maybe directionality that is provided in capitalism

1007
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:20,940
through private property and markets as competition. You would have to find a different form of

1008
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:29,100
mechanism for the production of pre-configuration, so to speak, for the alternative.

1009
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:37,180
But no, I don't think so. I don't think it's my problem. No. Why? Because we're not trying

1010
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:45,660
to build, in that sense, I depart from describing what so far we have been talking about for the

1011
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:52,220
last 10 minutes as a socialism. Because if you really wanted to, it's a non-capitalism at best,

1012
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:58,460
what I'm describing. And as a non-capitalism, it's not post-capitalism, it's a non-capitalism.

1013
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:03,100
And if you really want to go really far, you can say that you can have a multiplicity of

1014
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:10,460
non-capitalisms. And I don't think that it requires any grounding, for example, in an alternative

1015
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:16,860
property regime. I don't. You might argue that it would require certain rights to preserve those

1016
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:21,340
forms of right, to observe those forms of life. You might argue that you would need a right to

1017
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:27,260
ignorance of something, because that would be the only way to preserve certain core features.

1018
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:31,500
We might argue that you would need some kind of an institutional slack so that you don't

1019
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:40,380
over-optimize. But to generalize it to a theory that as a guiding lens here would be to convert

1020
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:47,340
it into an ism, which is not what I'm trying to do. So at best, my ism is a non-ism and it's a

1021
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:56,060
non-capitalism. Nice. Good answer. Even though I'm not saying that it would need to be a different

1022
01:42:56,060 --> 01:43:01,420
form of property regime that would provide this type of glue that I'm talking about.

1023
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:09,420
I also think you're mistaken with regards to property, to be honest. I can easily imagine,

1024
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:15,500
and in fact it exists, you can have capitalist relations now where property would be

1025
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:23,340
very different from the one we have, property regime, and where you would be able to look at

1026
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:36,060
the radical markets, people. If a certain piece of equipment is not used well by the capitalists

1027
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:40,540
who owns it, we're just going to come in and take it and put it on the auction and somebody

1028
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:45,820
will come in and buy it. That's a complete violation of the private property that you

1029
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:49,660
think is constitutive of capitalism, and I just don't think that for them it's constitutive of

1030
01:43:49,660 --> 01:44:00,460
capitalism. Fair enough. Good point. I don't think I'm holding back. Sorry, maybe I'm just

1031
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:09,660
in my bubble. To me, it seems pretty obvious. I live in a village here. Look at my books here.

1032
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:18,780
It's not exactly the most exciting reading you have here. It's possible I live in a bubble here,

1033
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:32,140
but I do think that there is something there. You're the person monitoring all the discourses

1034
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:40,700
most closely, so if anybody is guarded against being too much in a bubble, I think it's you,

1035
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:47,180
Evgeny. It's fair enough to say that there is a lot there, I think.

1036
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:51,420
Evgeny, thank you so much for being part of Future Histories.

1037
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:52,860
