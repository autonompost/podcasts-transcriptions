Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome Lea Ippie in today's show.

00:07.840 --> 00:12.960
She is professor of political theory at the London School of Economics

00:12.960 --> 00:18.480
and author of the brilliant book Free Coming of Age at the End of History.

00:18.480 --> 00:24.160
Before we start, I would like to thank Wilfried and Fabian for their kind donations

00:24.160 --> 00:29.760
and I would like to welcome BjÃ¶rn, Manuel and Gerion as patrons of Future Histories.

00:30.320 --> 00:35.520
Thank you so much and now please enjoy today's episode with Lea Ippie.

00:41.280 --> 00:47.120
Welcome Lea. Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure. Just to give the audience some

00:47.120 --> 00:52.880
orientation, could you give us a rough sketch of the quite unique position of socialist Albania

00:52.880 --> 00:57.120
and the conflict between East and West in the time when you were growing up?

00:58.080 --> 01:04.480
Yeah, so I grew up. I was born in 1979 and was growing up in Albania in the 80s

01:04.480 --> 01:11.360
and lived through the transition from being communist system to a liberal system in 1990.

01:13.120 --> 01:18.320
In the time in which I was growing up, Albania was a country with a socialist constitution

01:18.320 --> 01:22.880
which had fallen out with every other socialist country or at least every other socialist

01:22.880 --> 01:31.120
superpower in the world. It was also a very isolated country economically and militarily,

01:31.120 --> 01:38.880
politically on all fronts and the perception and the rhetoric of its own self-understanding

01:38.880 --> 01:44.160
that came through the history books and the classes and school when I was growing up was of

01:44.160 --> 01:50.240
it being this unique country that was engaged, a very small country which was engaged in a dual

01:50.240 --> 01:56.080
fight against both Western imperialism, so Anglo-Americans on the one hand, but also

01:56.080 --> 02:01.280
Soviet and Chinese imperialism on the other. And it hadn't been like that throughout its history,

02:01.280 --> 02:07.440
so Albania became socialist in 1946 at the end of the Second World War and it had a brief period

02:07.440 --> 02:11.920
of alliance with Yugoslavia with which it fell out mainly for issues to do with territorial

02:11.920 --> 02:18.720
integrity and what would happen to Albania and the reluctance of part of the Albanian socialist

02:18.720 --> 02:26.080
leadership to be part of Yugoslavia as a socialist republic as some other projects went and for that

02:26.080 --> 02:29.840
reason kind of allied with the Soviet Union but broke with the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union

02:30.560 --> 02:35.920
destalinized and criticized the cult of Stalin and Albania had this perception of itself as being the

02:35.920 --> 02:43.600
only rigorous, coherent, pure communist country in the world which somehow also in its self-understanding

02:43.600 --> 02:48.880
entailed maintaining the cult of Stalin and then there was this brief period of alliance with China

02:48.880 --> 02:53.280
and then eventually also broke with China when the Chinese became too moderate so basically when I

02:53.280 --> 02:58.960
was growing up it was completely on its own and the understanding was that it was on its own

02:58.960 --> 03:02.720
and the rhetoric was it was on its own and so this is how I grew up with this idea that

03:03.200 --> 03:08.640
it was a small country that stood up to all these great superpowers for the sake of a freedom that

03:08.640 --> 03:14.640
it defended and that we all as citizens of that state had a duty to defend as well.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.280
And what I particularly liked about the book was the way in which you approach the task of opening

03:21.280 --> 03:28.160
up our collective sense of political imagination because you do so in a I would say multi-directional

03:28.160 --> 03:33.520
manner you do it by reflecting upon the past in order to learn from concrete experiences in

03:33.520 --> 03:40.160
this case the experiences of communist Albania and its transition to liberal democracy and by

03:40.160 --> 03:45.520
looking at these concrete experiences you at the same time open up a space of possibility for both

03:46.080 --> 03:51.920
critical reflection about the present as well as the imagination of alternative futures I would say

03:51.920 --> 03:55.600
would you say this is an accurate description of the book's movement?

03:56.560 --> 04:03.680
Yeah I think the book is very much a book that is not prescriptive in any way and so to the extent

04:03.680 --> 04:08.800
that it has anything prescriptive in terms of how it should be understood it really is about opening

04:08.800 --> 04:14.960
up reflection spaces and then letting readers draw their own conclusions I'd say the overarching theme

04:14.960 --> 04:20.480
of the book is freedom and what it means to be free and with that connected with that the theme

04:20.480 --> 04:26.080
of autonomy and to kind of make decisions that you're responsible for even though you live in

04:26.080 --> 04:30.720
circumstances and conditions in which you don't actually make all the world according to the way

04:30.720 --> 04:34.320
which you'd wanted to make so you're kind of thrown into a world that you don't control

04:34.320 --> 04:39.360
but somehow have to make these decisions that you do have to take ownership of and own the

04:39.360 --> 04:46.880
consequences of and the book really does that by reflecting both at a personal level in terms of

04:46.880 --> 04:52.080
it's a coming-of-age story and so it's about an individual who discovers what freedom may or may

04:52.080 --> 04:58.560
not be and both the kind of the promises and the disillusionments of freedom and about a country

04:58.560 --> 05:04.240
that goes through a similar process of seeing freedom sometimes promised and sometimes betrayed

05:04.240 --> 05:10.960
and sometimes coming as a dream sometimes coming as a tragedy and all of these things I think

05:10.960 --> 05:17.920
enable the book to operate at different levels as you say of criticism both of various theories

05:17.920 --> 05:24.320
approaches and so abstract conceptions of you know how the world should be run and to try and

05:24.320 --> 05:29.760
think about that in context and also more importantly in how they affect individuals and

05:29.760 --> 05:34.400
how they make a difference to the lives of people but also then to reflect on the difficulties that

05:34.400 --> 05:38.080
these raise at the individual level in terms of their own personal people's personal choices

05:38.080 --> 05:44.320
and how they try to navigate these transitions and changes in the system and so on so I would

05:44.320 --> 05:49.040
say that because it's a book on freedom and because it's not really an abstract book on

05:49.040 --> 05:54.240
freedom even though there are many abstract themes that permeate all its chapters it's a book that

05:54.240 --> 05:59.840
really tries to leave the reader as free as possible in interpreting it and thinking about

05:59.840 --> 06:03.920
you know what does it mean where is it going what's the author trying to say and so on and so

06:04.880 --> 06:09.200
obviously I have it has a political message I have my own political messages and so on but I

06:09.200 --> 06:14.560
try not to say a lot more than the book already says about all these things and to just let people

06:14.560 --> 06:19.520
draw their own conclusions from it so it's a very open book in that sense and more as I say more a

06:19.520 --> 06:25.360
book of reflection and opening up spaces for reflection than on anything more concrete and

06:25.360 --> 06:33.200
more directed and more specific even though the book itself doesn't prescribe any interpretation

06:33.440 --> 06:39.680
and this is absolutely great I would be interested in your opinions anyway I guess and in the like

06:39.680 --> 06:46.560
abstract ideas and your positioning towards them as well and there's one passage in the book where

06:46.560 --> 06:53.120
you kind of dissect the new political language that is coming along with a system change and

06:53.120 --> 07:00.240
there are different words that that are new to you as a child or as a teenager and to the public in

07:00.240 --> 07:07.440
Albania in total I would say the words like civil society for example and there's a list that you

07:07.440 --> 07:13.200
have of words that got swapped for others and I'd like to quote some of them because you say that

07:13.200 --> 07:19.280
civil society joined other keywords such as liberalization which replaced democratic

07:19.280 --> 07:24.960
centralism privatization which replaced collectivization transparency which replaced

07:24.960 --> 07:31.040
self-criticism transition which stayed the same but now indicated the transition from socialism to

07:31.040 --> 07:37.680
liberalism instead of the transition from socialism to communism and fighting corruption which replaced

07:37.680 --> 07:43.840
anti-imperialist struggle end quote and then you state that all of these new terms that came up

07:43.840 --> 07:50.400
with this system change were connected to a word that both political systems used heavily and that's

07:50.480 --> 07:56.000
freedom as you already stated only now it was about the freedom of individual and not the

07:56.000 --> 08:01.600
collective so maybe we could talk a bit about these different conceptions of freedom you

08:01.600 --> 08:07.280
reflect upon in the book and how they are reflected within the different systems that you experienced

08:07.280 --> 08:14.640
and then maybe which ideas of freedom are still unrealized and unreflected in both of these systems

08:15.280 --> 08:21.680
yeah great so that's the in that is the big question of the book in a way it's it's the

08:21.680 --> 08:25.760
book is a reflection of these ideas different ideas of freedom and how they're central to

08:25.760 --> 08:31.920
these different systems and also in some ways in the book to central to also the life orientation

08:31.920 --> 08:37.360
of the particular characters of the book and I guess the two main ones that try I try to talk

08:37.360 --> 08:42.000
about as a political theorist is the ones that have in the intellectual tradition and

08:42.000 --> 08:45.600
history of political thought being thought of as alternatives to each other so on the one hand

08:45.600 --> 08:50.800
this idea of negative freedom and then the idea of positive freedom and I'll say a little bit more

08:50.800 --> 08:55.680
about each of them if I may and then I'll say what I think about both of them and where that

08:55.680 --> 09:01.680
what I think comes through in the book so there is this character in the book which is my mother

09:02.240 --> 09:09.840
who is a kind of arch libertarian and who is a proto or not proto-post Thatcherite figure

09:09.920 --> 09:17.840
or a contemporary of Thatcher at least she's sort of modeling herself on Thatcher in her hostility

09:17.840 --> 09:23.120
to socialism in her belief in individual responsibility in her belief in unlimited

09:23.120 --> 09:29.760
personal freedom which also entails the freedom to make mistakes and to let these uncoordinated

09:29.760 --> 09:34.240
structures of cooperation between individuals fail when they need to in the way in which

09:34.240 --> 09:40.960
sometimes it's described by Hayek or these kind of authors connected to that way of thinking and

09:40.960 --> 09:45.840
with this great resistance to the concept of the state and of bureaucracy and of administration as

09:45.840 --> 09:52.240
all abstract obstacles to the realization of this perfect individual freedom and that's in

09:52.240 --> 09:57.040
her conception this freedom is close to what has often been called negative freedom because it's

09:57.040 --> 10:03.600
the freedom from and so you are free to the extent that nobody tells you where to go what to do how

10:03.600 --> 10:11.040
to dress and in that in those freedoms being absent is consists the lack of freedom of a society

10:11.040 --> 10:17.840
and of course Albania in that sense or communist society of that kind and of the kind I grew up in

10:17.840 --> 10:23.440
was a paradigmatic example of the violation of these freedoms because you couldn't think freely

10:23.440 --> 10:28.000
you could you weren't allowed to express your opinions in writing you weren't allowed to protest

10:28.000 --> 10:32.160
you would actually be harshly punished if you try to leave the country and so there is a number of

10:32.160 --> 10:37.680
domains of personal life in which individuals could not be free and so my mother thought that

10:37.680 --> 10:42.560
and this this conception of freedom that she stands for in some way this negative conception

10:42.560 --> 10:50.640
of freedom is represented by this violation that Albanian communism exemplified in its most severe

10:50.640 --> 10:57.120
most extreme form and is gained after in the transition after 1990 because it is exactly

10:57.120 --> 11:04.560
what comes it's the ability to vote freely in elections to have uncontrolled uncensored

11:04.560 --> 11:12.240
political opinions to also travel outside the country and so on and that's some of these things

11:12.240 --> 11:16.640
are the kinds of things that I put pressure on this conception of freedom when I say that the

11:16.640 --> 11:23.680
freedom from or for example the freedom from obstacles to traveling isn't that robust and

11:23.680 --> 11:30.160
isn't that meaningful if you don't actually have options too and so this takes us to a different

11:30.160 --> 11:35.840
slightly not antagonistic but complementary I would say account of freedom which is the one

11:35.840 --> 11:41.360
that my father exemplifies in the book so he is this character who is some people define him as

11:41.360 --> 11:47.200
a kind of classical lefty or social democrat but more kind of radical kind or someone with left

11:47.200 --> 11:52.400
leanings who is very concerned by opportunities opportunities to flourish opportunities to be who

11:52.400 --> 11:58.640
you are and to realize yourself and who realizes also that this negative conception of freedom is

11:58.640 --> 12:05.200
not enough to guarantee that but you know freedom is also freedom too it's not just freedom from

12:05.200 --> 12:11.600
it's not just a freedom from an agent interfering with your personal choices it's also freedom to

12:11.600 --> 12:16.720
find opportunities in a social structure that is hospitable to your choices and to your autonomy

12:17.280 --> 12:21.840
and he's interesting because he has this alternative conception of freedom

12:22.720 --> 12:26.800
sometimes in the liberal literature in the kind of classical liberal literature so if

12:26.800 --> 12:32.960
you think for example of Isaiah Berlin's account of freedom and his criticisms of negative or

12:32.960 --> 12:39.360
positive freedom often the idea of positive freedom is represented as the idea of having

12:39.360 --> 12:43.440
an authority that actually guarantees these conditions for freedom and so it's often presented

12:43.440 --> 12:47.520
as what you want you either you can either have negative freedom or if you want positive freedom

12:47.520 --> 12:51.680
the positive freedom leads you to a kind of totalitarian abuse because if it gives to a

12:51.680 --> 12:57.280
collective responsibility for the realization of the individual that are somewhat dangerous

12:57.280 --> 13:03.200
but in some ways you also see that that positive freedom is actually what is missing in post

13:03.200 --> 13:08.480
communist Albania in the 90s is precisely this idea that you are formally free allegedly free

13:08.480 --> 13:14.240
in fact you have negative freedom but what you don't have is often positive freedom in terms of

13:14.240 --> 13:18.880
the environment in which you live the society in which you live making accommodations to your

13:18.880 --> 13:23.280
ability to realize yourself and so there's two examples in the book one is the freedom of

13:23.280 --> 13:28.080
movement one which I talk about this idea that you can be free to leave your country nobody shoots

13:28.080 --> 13:32.800
you anymore at the border but then you're trying to get into the west and the borders are closed

13:32.800 --> 13:37.920
and so where do you go does that mean that you really have freedom of movement or not if you

13:38.560 --> 13:44.480
don't have the freedom to be somewhere as opposed to just the freedom from leaving somewhere and in

13:44.480 --> 13:50.480
another dimension it comes out because my father despite him being a lefty and being very concerned

13:50.480 --> 13:55.200
by this conception by this idea of a society that is accommodating for everyone and so on

13:55.760 --> 14:02.000
is at one point in a position of responsibility and needs to make decisions for firing workers

14:02.000 --> 14:07.040
as a result of the structural reforms that were brought about with the help of international

14:07.040 --> 14:13.040
institutions like the world bank and the imf and so on and to implement what was called the

14:13.040 --> 14:18.800
shock therapy that was a way in which people talked about how the societies of eastern

14:18.800 --> 14:25.360
europe had to be brought up to being up to scratch with the standards of free market societies both

14:25.360 --> 14:31.280
political and economic and this would entail shutting down state enterprises privatizing

14:31.280 --> 14:37.440
wealth and increasing the ability of individuals to take free economic initiatives which brought

14:37.440 --> 14:41.600
a huge cost which in some case also entailed a raise of unemployment for example and my father was

14:42.960 --> 14:48.400
responsible for firing people on behalf of those who were supporting these structural reforms

14:48.400 --> 14:52.640
which he found very difficult because to connect it to this conception of freedom

14:52.640 --> 14:58.640
it's very hard to think that you have a positive freedom if you are not able to flourish in society

14:58.640 --> 15:03.760
and you can't flourish if you don't have a job basically so this is the the second idea and so

15:03.760 --> 15:08.320
there's a sense in which one might simplify it by saying you can have a society in which

15:08.320 --> 15:14.800
you are guaranteed from unemployment but you don't have freedom of speech and another society is you

15:14.800 --> 15:19.920
have freedom of speech but no guarantees from unemployment and these are deficient models of

15:19.920 --> 15:26.480
freedom but from different reasons and on different conceptions of freedom so that's the the kind of

15:26.480 --> 15:33.200
crude simplified picture of these two alternatives that I present and then there's still room for

15:33.200 --> 15:37.760
something else isn't it you paint a picture of these alternatives and these are of course kind

15:37.760 --> 15:48.240
of prototypes of conceptions of freedom but both of these alone miss something for sure and we

15:48.240 --> 15:55.600
should develop some alternative which kind of brings in additional notions of what freedom

15:55.600 --> 16:02.080
could actually be like so what is it that is still unresolved when you simply just

16:02.720 --> 16:08.560
take these two examples as if this was the whole thing that is actually possible

16:10.000 --> 16:16.480
yeah so the one that I describe in the book and that I'm interested in exploring is something

16:16.480 --> 16:23.280
that comes through my grandmother's character and the idea that she basically for both from

16:23.280 --> 16:28.400
my mother and from my father they lived in they live in unfree societies both of them are unfree

16:28.400 --> 16:33.200
for different reasons but you know they fail to realize the promises that they make and what's

16:33.200 --> 16:37.680
interesting about my grandmother is that she has someone who has lived through different transitions

16:37.680 --> 16:46.000
different political systems different political communities she's born in this ottoman town

16:46.000 --> 16:51.280
salonica shortly before it became shortly before the ottoman empire collapsed for good and so her

16:51.280 --> 16:57.440
identity is one of a political unit unit that doesn't exist anymore and she and then she came

16:57.440 --> 17:05.280
to albania and was the wife of was first integrated in the albanian elite and was relatively progressive

17:05.280 --> 17:10.320
but then her husband went to prison and so she was deported and had ended up in working in labor

17:10.320 --> 17:15.360
camps and had this very difficult life under communism and what always stood out about her

17:15.360 --> 17:20.480
was the fact that whenever you asked her to you know to talk about her life she never stressed

17:20.480 --> 17:25.760
the oppression she always is stressed stressed agency the fact that even in all these circumstances

17:25.760 --> 17:30.800
she was able to find her direction and to take responsibility for the things that she had done

17:31.600 --> 17:37.760
and she brought me up this kind of inculcating me with this idea that even in the most oppressive

17:37.760 --> 17:42.400
circumstances there is something that no nobody can take away from you which is free which is

17:42.400 --> 17:48.080
human dignity and in that human dignity consists freedom and so and this is why partly i became

17:48.080 --> 17:54.720
later interested in exploring this idea but for me freedom is something that is revealed in moral

17:54.720 --> 18:01.760
agency in your ability to make choices between the good and the bad and to resist compromises

18:01.760 --> 18:06.800
that bring huge costs to other people and i would say that's a more critical conception of freedom

18:06.800 --> 18:11.920
that's neither positive nor negative freedom but it's exactly as i call it when i talk about the

18:11.920 --> 18:17.360
book and when i talk about my favorite conception of freedom is freedom as moral agency and that

18:17.360 --> 18:24.480
means that this freedom of moral agency which is revealed in the agent's capacity to see that they

18:24.480 --> 18:29.440
have this inner freedom but they live in a world that doesn't realize these moral relations that

18:29.440 --> 18:33.200
doesn't in a world that doesn't dignify people where you have this internal dignity but the

18:33.200 --> 18:38.320
dignity is not recognized in the social relations between people that's a more abstract way of

18:38.320 --> 18:42.560
talking about unfreedom than to just say it's not having the freedom to work or it's not having the

18:42.560 --> 18:48.160
freedom to talk or whatever it's basically about what kind of social relations what kind of

18:48.160 --> 18:53.280
political world you want to live in and is it possible for that world to realize this morality

18:53.280 --> 18:57.440
this kind of core morality that we find in the individual and that is never actually taken away

18:57.440 --> 19:01.840
from and so this is slightly different because in one way you're free always because you're

19:01.840 --> 19:07.120
always a moral agent and you always have the capacity to discern the good from the bad but in

19:07.120 --> 19:12.320
another way you're also not free when you don't live in a world in which that is instantiated

19:12.320 --> 19:18.800
at the level of social relations and so this conception of freedom as moral agency i think

19:18.800 --> 19:26.240
gives you a kind of critical benchmark from which you can observe and assess the circumstances of

19:26.240 --> 19:32.000
the societies in which you live and you can also make decisions about how critical to be of those

19:32.000 --> 19:36.960
societies and how to examine the politics of those societies and to see whether they're actually

19:36.960 --> 19:45.600
realizing freedom or not very interesting i mean this moral agency this can hardly be

19:45.600 --> 19:53.840
independent of the socio-political structures that forms them that kind of set the scene for

19:54.880 --> 20:00.480
the individual to act within so how do you define this relation between the

20:00.480 --> 20:07.680
the like superstructure so to speak and the individual that should rely on this kind of

20:07.680 --> 20:14.880
moral agency because i mean this is highly entangled isn't it yeah so i think the the

20:14.880 --> 20:20.400
moral agency is what enables you to be critical of the structures in which you live and so it's

20:20.400 --> 20:25.440
what enables you to ask yourself the question of do i live in a political environment or in an

20:25.520 --> 20:31.520
economic environment or in a social environment in which dignity is realized and to me that entails

20:31.520 --> 20:38.080
a range of criticisms about the absence of those freedoms in a lot of domains that we are surrounded

20:38.080 --> 20:43.440
by and so and as an ideal of a kind of society that you want to live in i think it takes you

20:43.440 --> 20:50.320
to a fully egalitarian democratic society in which democracy is central to realizing freedom

20:50.320 --> 20:57.840
in moral relations amongst all people and the reason that takes you to a critique of both the

20:57.840 --> 21:02.880
economic and the political order and social order in which we live is that we live in an order in

21:02.880 --> 21:07.760
which that is actually shaped by asymmetries of power of all kinds and that can be economic

21:07.760 --> 21:13.120
power it can be social power it can be political power it can be about the power of bigger states

21:13.120 --> 21:18.480
towards smaller states in the international sphere it can be about the power of employers

21:18.480 --> 21:24.480
that have money versus vulnerable citizens that don't have money in the labor market it can be

21:24.480 --> 21:31.440
about social relations and hierarchies of race or language or identity that kind of permeate these

21:31.440 --> 21:37.600
historical self-understandings of people and so i think none of it is defined but what it what

21:37.600 --> 21:43.360
what you get from this conception is a way of criticizing what the environment in which you

21:43.360 --> 21:48.080
live in and that can give you the kind of critical standard with which to then try and

21:48.640 --> 21:53.680
move forward from the critique and and then to kind of collaborate with others as well and to

21:53.680 --> 21:59.520
work with others to to try and construct something that is better that's very interesting because

21:59.520 --> 22:07.760
this is again highly tied to the biographical the image that you paint of yourself as a child and

22:07.760 --> 22:12.160
maybe early teenager within the book because there's this moment where you realize that

22:12.960 --> 22:20.080
all of the structures that had given you some kind of standing within the world some kind of

22:20.080 --> 22:26.160
help in terms of sense making and and all of this kind of collapsed at some point where you realized

22:26.160 --> 22:33.600
that this so to speak moral agency that you that you talk about had actually been kind of absent

22:33.600 --> 22:39.680
because you had been living within structures that were not kind of producing this moral agency

22:39.680 --> 22:46.240
within the individuals and so you have this moment of realization that that all of this

22:46.240 --> 22:55.040
actually was not given within your life up until this point i'd say no um yeah although i think

22:55.040 --> 22:58.480
so this the thing is there is a difference between the perspective of a child and the

22:58.480 --> 23:02.320
perspective of a grown-up and that's why the coming-of-age aspect of the book is really

23:02.320 --> 23:07.120
important because in some ways it's about it's a book about reaching maturity and the ways in

23:07.120 --> 23:13.120
which we come to discover the truth and in my case and also about the importance of education

23:13.120 --> 23:18.000
and of people around you in bringing you to see these truths or to kind of not so much to see

23:18.000 --> 23:23.360
the truth but to see ways of thinking about the truth and accessing it and in many ways it's a

23:23.360 --> 23:30.720
story about the dangers of ideology and the the risks that every society that we live in every

23:30.720 --> 23:36.400
system that we are under comes packaged with ideas or dominant discourses about how we should

23:36.400 --> 23:41.200
understand that society how we should understand the system and they become part of the ordinary

23:41.200 --> 23:47.600
language and part of the vocabulary with which we refer to that system and make it very hard for us

23:47.600 --> 23:53.920
in some ways to kind of stand out but on the other hand it's also a story about resilience and the

23:53.920 --> 24:00.320
fact that these critical capacities are always there as they are in my grandmother and often

24:00.320 --> 24:04.880
being a mature person or being a moral agent is about realizing that these capacities are there

24:04.880 --> 24:10.240
they may be more or less dormant and they may be depending on circumstances more possible or less

24:10.240 --> 24:14.720
possible to be activated but i think it's really important that they are there because that is

24:14.720 --> 24:21.920
the only thing that enables people to rise above ideology to rise about the given scripts to rise

24:21.920 --> 24:26.080
above the fact that you get told slogans and that you internalize these slogans about the

24:26.080 --> 24:31.120
world in which you live and you're never able to fully see beyond those slogans unless you discover

24:31.120 --> 24:37.120
this kind of critical capacity that is in everyone interesting i'm still kind of trying to

24:37.120 --> 24:43.680
to get an idea of whether or not this kind of entails some form of essentialism where there

24:43.680 --> 24:53.920
is this like sensor that kind of makes you realize whether something is wrong or right it sounds a

24:53.920 --> 24:59.600
bit like that there's a part in your book where you kind of reflect upon yourself and ask yourself

24:59.600 --> 25:05.280
whether or not you might have become someone who would have never come to a position where

25:05.280 --> 25:11.440
you would have had these moral agencies and so this at least within the book it sounds as if

25:11.440 --> 25:16.160
you considered that this might have been a possibility so this would lead us to a place

25:16.160 --> 25:23.680
where there is not an kind of sensor built within each and every individual that at the end will

25:23.760 --> 25:30.160
reveal this kind of critical capacity but that there is indeed the possibility of like full

25:30.160 --> 25:40.640
ideology so to speak where this this idea of critical reflection is so much like out of out

25:40.640 --> 25:48.560
of the realm of possibility that it is not even considered yeah so this is not in the book it's

25:48.560 --> 25:52.480
i mean this is not a question that i raise as a as a question as a philosophical question in the

25:52.480 --> 25:56.560
book but i can tell you what i think about it so i think there is a kind of essentialism which is

25:56.560 --> 26:01.920
an essentialism about reason and it's not an essentialism about you know a thing but it's an

26:01.920 --> 26:06.960
essentialism about a capacity that only humans have to the extent that they have reason and so

26:07.760 --> 26:12.320
the assumption that i make in my other work not in this work is that not in this book

26:12.320 --> 26:16.720
is that to the extent that people have reason they have this capacity and this moral capacity

26:16.720 --> 26:21.120
is the thing that is you know something that you can't alienate if you have reason then you're

26:21.120 --> 26:26.000
able to see this and you may be able to hear it more strongly or less strongly so you may be a

26:26.000 --> 26:30.320
victim again it's a question of nuance and different people will be exposed to these

26:30.320 --> 26:34.880
influences in different ways so you have to allow for the possibility as i do in my book that i

26:34.880 --> 26:40.480
might have become someone who was a state bureaucrat or or someone who in the end absorbs

26:40.480 --> 26:46.000
a family narrative and turns against the state and becomes a dissident and so i don't deny that

26:46.000 --> 26:51.760
personal histories and biographies condition how we think about freedom the extent to which

26:51.760 --> 26:56.400
we are free but i also don't want to fully allow for that so i think it's somewhere and this is

26:56.400 --> 27:01.600
why the book is ambiguous and this is why perhaps the the narrative voice of the book is one of

27:01.600 --> 27:06.640
ambiguity because this and this is why it's a really a story that works with kind of showing

27:06.640 --> 27:10.640
rather than trying to convince people that this is how it is you can just tell different stories

27:10.640 --> 27:15.120
of different people and you can present them with different accounts and ways of understanding

27:15.120 --> 27:19.920
themselves to make these arguments because they're not really it's not an either or i think and so

27:20.640 --> 27:26.720
yeah fundamentally i am convinced that we all can see this that even a murderer or even a kind of

27:26.720 --> 27:32.240
criminal or even someone who is purely or pure racist or whatever has something in them that

27:32.240 --> 27:36.640
will at some point make them see that this is the right the wrong way to think about the world and

27:36.640 --> 27:41.760
that you know that the way they are operating what they think is right is actually just their might

27:41.760 --> 27:48.160
in a way and i'm kind of wedded to that world you it's a very and this but this is a very old

27:48.160 --> 27:55.760
and long and in some ways unreconcilable debate which i think is to some extent really you only

27:55.760 --> 28:02.640
reconcile it by somehow making a leap of faith in a way in humanity and in morality and and the

28:02.640 --> 28:07.040
fact that reason entails this you can't completely resolve it but if you don't resolve it then you're

28:07.040 --> 28:10.880
left with very little if you don't resolve it with this leap of faith then that is the basis for

28:10.880 --> 28:15.520
every argument this is the base for democracy it's the basis for argumentation it's the basis

28:15.520 --> 28:20.960
on which we try to convince each other and the basis on which we try to overcome our

28:20.960 --> 28:25.440
particularity to try and have these conversations with each other and so if that's not there

28:25.440 --> 28:29.120
all of these things become really difficult because we can never leave the position

28:29.840 --> 28:33.680
from which we speak we can never leave our stories behind we can never leave our personal

28:33.680 --> 28:38.560
histories we can never leave the conditioning behind and so i think it's just it's there's a

28:38.560 --> 28:42.640
sense in which you ask yourself okay what can you do with these two conceptions and you discover

28:42.640 --> 28:47.120
that with the one you can it's a starting point for something for a process and with the other

28:47.120 --> 28:53.040
it doesn't really take you anywhere all right and we want to get to places so let's go along with

28:53.040 --> 28:58.480
this one with this route and ask which kind of political economies might be best suited

28:58.480 --> 29:06.160
to bring about this idea of freedoms in plural maybe and you briefly mentioned shock therapy

29:06.160 --> 29:12.160
i did an episode with isabella m veba on her really great book how china escaped shock therapy

29:12.720 --> 29:19.200
and unfortunately albania did not escape shock therapy if i'm not mistaken and there's a strand

29:19.200 --> 29:25.920
of future histories that is dedicated to the question of democratic plant economies now you

29:25.920 --> 29:35.280
have experienced uh hierarchical non-democratic central uh economies plant economies as well as

29:35.280 --> 29:41.840
so-called liberal market economies so i would be very much interested in your opinion on the

29:41.840 --> 29:49.360
question of democratic plant economies and their possibility my vote would go out for some type of

29:49.360 --> 29:55.920
libertarian socialist plant economy i'd say which might be called in german freie planwirtschaft

29:55.920 --> 30:03.040
this is a attack i really enjoy actually is this something you would consider given both your

30:03.040 --> 30:10.320
experiences with different systems as well as your intellectual reflection yeah so i mean i can

30:10.320 --> 30:13.920
i can speak to this but i'm not an expert on it so i'm not going to say anything that is

30:13.920 --> 30:20.160
particularly authoritative or informed or you know that has thought through where my where my

30:20.160 --> 30:27.520
critiques take me is basically to a point of radical rejection of capitalism i suppose and

30:27.520 --> 30:33.040
of the monopolies of economic power and of the lack of control that the free market brings for

30:33.040 --> 30:37.520
individuals and of the fact that there is a kind of doctrine of the free market which just happens

30:37.520 --> 30:43.120
to be precisely the shock therapy doctrine the idea that you know unintended consequences produce

30:43.120 --> 30:48.240
good things for from the vices of everyone there will be virtues and the to the extent that there

30:48.240 --> 30:52.080
are costs these need to be borne by the individuals because it's just a matter of personal

30:52.080 --> 30:57.360
responsibility and so there is a sense in which there is a faith in these anonymous forces of the

30:57.360 --> 31:02.960
free market that i'm not particularly keen on because i think that's a loss of control and if

31:02.960 --> 31:09.360
you care about freedom and agency that's one way in which you don't have that agency having said

31:09.360 --> 31:14.800
that i think there are possible alternatives and there's many models but i'm also usually very

31:14.800 --> 31:20.000
reluctant to say which of the models is the right one because i think it should be a matter of

31:20.000 --> 31:25.120
democratic scrutiny and debate so what you can do is you can put you can say i think this is a model

31:25.120 --> 31:30.320
that really doesn't work and so you know there's some things in the world that are just plain wrong

31:30.320 --> 31:34.560
that are actually the dominant ones in the world in which we live you know there's concentrations

31:34.560 --> 31:41.200
of wealth and power by both individuals and states that on this account of freedom are very easy to

31:41.200 --> 31:46.320
point out that they're flawed and that should be rejected but then once you've done this work of

31:46.320 --> 31:53.680
rejection you are left with a lot of possibilities and i don't think maybe i'm wrong on this but i

31:53.680 --> 31:58.480
don't think i have any particular stake or any particular insight or any particular knowledge or

31:58.480 --> 32:02.400
better knowledge than other people to say this is the way to go this is the right model because

32:02.400 --> 32:07.600
my take is that a lot of these things should be subject to democratic scrutiny and that you

32:07.600 --> 32:11.920
should create spaces for democratic interaction in which these different projects can emerge and be

32:11.920 --> 32:16.800
confronted with each other and it's only when you have this exchange that you're actually really

32:16.800 --> 32:22.240
able to see how they go and whether you can assess them fully it's only when they're articulated in

32:22.240 --> 32:26.880
the public sphere and when they're articulated with the help of lots of different people not

32:26.880 --> 32:32.960
just philosophers and not just economists and not just politicians but it's a kind of there's a

32:32.960 --> 32:37.680
sense in which all of us contribute with our skills so articulating these views but there is

32:37.680 --> 32:42.240
a political process through which these views need to be articulated and exchanged with each other

32:42.240 --> 32:48.320
and then whatever emerges from this process is something that i would cherish and hold on to but

32:48.320 --> 32:54.720
i don't want to say you know i think this is a way to go either you know because i think that's

32:54.720 --> 33:02.080
one of the problems in some ways of both actually the tradition of democratic of central planning

33:02.080 --> 33:07.120
and the tradition that that succeed that came after you know this idea of kind of making policy

33:07.120 --> 33:12.560
without politics is precisely that people were so invested in coming up with the right policies

33:12.560 --> 33:17.120
that they forget that every policy should be a matter for democratic debate and and that's what

33:17.120 --> 33:21.520
i'm really keen on now it may be because i'm not an expert so i'm political theorist and so i care

33:21.520 --> 33:27.760
about democracy and i think it's really important to get around this relationship between elites

33:27.760 --> 33:32.480
or experts and the public in the right way and to articulate that relationship in the right way and

33:32.480 --> 33:38.400
democracy helps us do that and so yeah i don't think i have a lot more in terms of the specifics

33:38.400 --> 33:45.120
of the projects huh that's interesting because i mean i totally get it there it's absolutely

33:45.120 --> 33:53.040
important to kind of point out the the critique and you have developed a an idea of freedom that

33:53.040 --> 34:00.320
allows you to point towards different forms of of dysfunction where this freedom is actually not

34:00.320 --> 34:07.440
being produced within the present but still this must at some point have led you to at least

34:07.440 --> 34:14.800
wondering about how the kinds of freedoms that you would like to see being produced how they

34:14.800 --> 34:20.080
could be brought about in which kind of like political economy they could be brought about

34:20.080 --> 34:26.640
and i would say i totally understand it's not about like prescribing some kind of one best way

34:26.640 --> 34:31.280
i absolutely share that but this doesn't mean that we should not engage in the question of

34:32.000 --> 34:38.480
how could alternatives actually look like because if we do not do that then we kind of stand there

34:38.480 --> 34:45.360
with empty hands if people are rightfully frustrated with the status quo actually and

34:45.360 --> 34:52.800
we need to have i would say we need to have some kinds of ideas of how alternatives could

34:53.600 --> 34:59.840
look like and it should be a plurality of ideas of course and they should be debated but there

34:59.840 --> 35:04.800
should be ideas i mean i would say yeah yeah no no so i'm not saying i'm not saying there

35:04.800 --> 35:08.480
shouldn't be ideas i'm just saying that i'm not the right person to articulate this political

35:08.480 --> 35:13.600
economy proposal i see that's all i'm saying i'm saying there is a i'm saying there's a division

35:13.600 --> 35:19.360
of labor in society whereby all of us do certain things and are better because of the knowledge

35:19.360 --> 35:24.480
and the stories and whatever background they have at articulating different things and bringing them

35:24.480 --> 35:30.000
in the public sphere and i'm just not someone who is able to speak competently on the question of

35:30.000 --> 35:34.880
exactly you know what political economy do we need i'm saying that my take at a generic level

35:34.880 --> 35:40.000
takes me to a criticism of capitalism as the system in which we live and so i think that what

35:40.000 --> 35:45.440
we should be looking at is an economy beyond capitalism now you know where exactly how exactly

35:45.440 --> 35:52.640
that works at at each level local national global at some level is a question of democratic debate

35:52.640 --> 35:58.160
and so i i think i would still subscribe to that but at another level is you know in that democratic

35:58.160 --> 36:03.200
debate what do what does each of us contribute and i don't contribute alternative policies

36:03.200 --> 36:07.920
because that's not what i do and i don't know enough about that i see i see okay i know i get

36:07.920 --> 36:17.360
it and but what you do actually contribute is a very concrete investigation of your own experience

36:17.360 --> 36:24.800
and at some point at the end of the book where you have an epilogue you point towards a discussion

36:24.800 --> 36:30.720
group a marxist discussion group with some of your friends i think in italy or maybe great britain

36:30.720 --> 36:36.240
and you state that my friends is my friends socialism was clear bright and in the future

36:36.240 --> 36:46.720
mine was messy bloody and of the past end quote and i think what you also try or at least it

36:46.720 --> 36:54.720
seemed to me as if what you try there is pointing us towards maybe what you just said i'm not the

36:54.720 --> 37:00.640
one to paint a picture of a concrete alternative political economy but what i can bring to the

37:00.640 --> 37:07.440
table is looking back at these concrete experiences and there's something to be learned from those

37:08.080 --> 37:13.840
so what is it that you want to show your friends from the study group and us as readers when

37:13.840 --> 37:18.720
looking at these stories these people these experiences what what do they bring forth

37:19.680 --> 37:26.480
yeah i think in a way exactly what you said so this sensitivity to history and to historical

37:26.480 --> 37:31.600
circumstances i mean for me that sentence about you know their socialism was in the future and

37:31.600 --> 37:36.560
mine was in the past really is a sentence about biography because here there are you know these

37:36.560 --> 37:43.680
western former liberals who have turned radicals who only think about you know how what this future

37:43.680 --> 37:49.040
is going to be and how future society will be and in thinking about that dismiss the history

37:49.040 --> 37:54.480
of real world socialism as though it wasn't relevant to these kinds of thinking about the

37:54.480 --> 38:00.320
future to these kinds of projects where to me one of the most important questions to ask is

38:00.320 --> 38:06.240
why do societies that subscribe to these principles why did they fail historically what did they do

38:06.240 --> 38:11.440
wrong and one of them is to do about the absence of democracy this is why i kind of care so much

38:11.440 --> 38:14.800
about democracy and the fact that it's not you know you don't it's not about having the right

38:14.800 --> 38:19.440
policy having the right principle having the right vision it's actually about having the right

38:19.440 --> 38:25.520
environment for enabling conversations to be had that often take a confrontational form that

38:26.320 --> 38:31.920
where you actually have this robust possibility of speaking between different alternatives and

38:31.920 --> 38:36.720
where you radicalize democracy rather than suppressing it as these societies historically

38:36.720 --> 38:42.640
did who better who worse you know who more who less and so there's again there's nuances there

38:42.640 --> 38:47.440
and to me to treat to put all of these societies in one big bag as I say in the book you know to

38:47.440 --> 38:53.200
say oh these are failed socialisms like China, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Albania when

38:53.200 --> 38:58.640
they're so different and when they have all these internal debates with each other is to be completely

38:58.640 --> 39:02.880
ignorant of the past but in a way that is also hampering for your own thinking of the future

39:02.880 --> 39:07.520
because there's a wealth of knowledge there and resources that you need to engage with in order

39:07.520 --> 39:13.280
to be able to reflect on possibilities for changing societies again compatibly with these

39:13.280 --> 39:19.840
ideals and so I think that's the that's the simple story in a way so there I'm encountering this

39:19.840 --> 39:24.800
group of people who only thinks about the future and comes from a very different experience and

39:24.800 --> 39:28.960
on the other hand my socialism when I came out of Albania and that's my that's why that sentence is

39:28.960 --> 39:35.120
there really is just associated to the past and lacks a future and so it's the exact opposite it's

39:35.120 --> 39:40.880
I come from a place in which people think well socialism is done and dusted and there is no way

39:40.880 --> 39:46.960
to think about it for the future and I'm someone who wants to still be able to contemplate the

39:46.960 --> 39:50.400
ideas because she thinks that there is something in the critique of capitalism because she thinks

39:50.400 --> 39:57.120
there's something in the kind of account of democracy that is there in the in the thought

39:57.120 --> 40:01.360
processes and in the intellectual tradition that is important to recover

40:01.360 --> 40:06.320
and so you have on the one hand the people with a wealth of knowledge about the past but no

40:06.880 --> 40:11.440
beliefs in the future and here you have another people who has a lot of stuff to say about the

40:11.440 --> 40:14.880
future but doesn't want to engage with the past and there's something missing in these

40:14.880 --> 40:19.360
interactions that I think there's a kind of gap that needs to be bridged and can only be bridged

40:20.000 --> 40:25.360
with I think an open mind to how history works and to the fact that you never as I say in the

40:25.360 --> 40:29.440
beginning of the book you never make history out of your own free will but you make it

40:29.440 --> 40:34.720
nevertheless and it's important to engage with both of these thoughts and to and to hold tensions

40:37.040 --> 40:42.800
Brilliant and I guess what you do with the book is exactly that you you kind of mediate between

40:42.800 --> 40:51.520
these words between the the the also contemporary Albania and the non-futures that they like

40:51.520 --> 40:56.800
experience somewhat what is the experience in doing that because I saw that you you went on

40:56.800 --> 41:03.920
tv shows in Albania so you interacted with the Albanian public on this topic so how did the

41:03.920 --> 41:11.280
they receive this book how do they receive this this whole notion of trying to get to different

41:11.280 --> 41:17.920
points of reflecting on on the history of Albania and trying to gain something out of it

41:18.640 --> 41:25.280
I would say that it's divided the the opinion is divided but sometimes it's divided by politics

41:25.280 --> 41:29.440
in the way in which it would be here as well if you were to try and say you know I think socialism

41:29.440 --> 41:33.200
still has a future it's probably quite likely that you'll meet a lot of people who will say no

41:33.200 --> 41:38.000
socialism only has a past and this is the past and in Albania obviously that's much more life

41:38.000 --> 41:44.080
because of the actual past and the kind of past that it is so it's also somewhat understandable

41:44.080 --> 41:48.880
the other part of the the critical reception of the book is that obviously the book does a

41:48.880 --> 41:54.720
lot with the history of Albania and does a lot with Albania as such but I also say that when

41:54.720 --> 41:58.640
here as I'm doing here it's also a book about ideas and kind of it's a philosophical book in

41:58.640 --> 42:03.680
many ways and there is a worry that if you come from a small country and you've written a book

42:03.680 --> 42:09.120
that a lot of people read outside that small country and that is successful by some criterion

42:09.120 --> 42:15.760
there is a worry that that book becomes the story of that country which is understandable and so I

42:15.760 --> 42:20.880
think there is a bit of reaction and resentment with that because it's it's only my story it's

42:20.880 --> 42:25.440
not everyone's story and it's also my ideas it's not everyone's ideas and so there is a

42:25.440 --> 42:31.520
word that if this is a book about Albania that explains Albanian transition to the western world

42:31.520 --> 42:36.320
there is a burden of responsibility on one book and one author which an author in a book from a

42:36.320 --> 42:41.600
dominant hegemonic country doesn't usually have but that's completely understandable that people

42:41.600 --> 42:47.280
are frustrated and sometimes resentful because you know they think there's another way of talking

42:47.280 --> 42:53.520
about this past which is not mine and I share that and I understand that so I think but that

42:53.520 --> 42:58.320
speaks to the in some ways to the to the problems with the way in which the book market works and

42:58.320 --> 43:02.880
the way with circulation of knowledge works and dominant cultures operate and how they engage with

43:02.880 --> 43:06.480
smaller cultures which I think as I say it's a kind of legitimate word but not one that you

43:06.480 --> 43:10.880
can really bear the burden of as an author whereas when it comes to the politics I think

43:12.240 --> 43:16.160
I mean it's hard to say because this is another question that often comes up as people say to me

43:16.160 --> 43:21.680
are you comparing kind of socialism with liberalism and in a way the thing is that liberal period is

43:21.680 --> 43:25.520
still going on in Albania so it's really hard to compare something that's complete with something

43:25.520 --> 43:31.280
that's not complete right and and so people often read the book as a book of comparison when it's

43:31.280 --> 43:36.000
actually not it's a book about freedom and how ideas of freedom emerge in different circumstances

43:36.000 --> 43:41.760
and by different characters but I think it's in some ways revealing of the mindset of the country

43:41.760 --> 43:46.000
which is about you know there's these two alternatives and one is the past and one is

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
the future and the one is about the future is something that we still need to hold on to

43:50.000 --> 43:53.760
otherwise what do we get we still get the past and so it's really hard to get out of this binary

43:53.760 --> 43:58.960
logic which is what you know the country has been stuck in for the last 30 years which was there

43:58.960 --> 44:03.440
when it's emerged because there was this idea of the end of history and you know if it's not that

44:03.440 --> 44:08.800
and so in some ways I think ideologically at least this notion that there is no alternative

44:08.800 --> 44:12.720
is still there and it's still very powerful and perhaps not just in Albania but also in other

44:12.720 --> 44:19.760
countries yes indeed it is and I mean at the end you you saw a system change in real life so you

44:19.760 --> 44:24.800
experienced the system change though so that makes it kind of a little bit easier to see that of

44:24.800 --> 44:29.600
course things could be different you know and I mean there are many people in within

44:30.480 --> 44:35.040
western countries for sure that still very much stick to this idea of capitalist realism

44:35.920 --> 44:40.880
that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism so

44:40.880 --> 44:46.400
you have seen different systems of political economy so you you know for sure it's not true

44:46.400 --> 44:52.160
so that's kind of a positive I would say in your in your last answer you briefly said

44:52.800 --> 45:00.160
that you do believe that socialism has a future so do you because you were kind of reluctant

45:00.960 --> 45:08.800
when it comes to describing alternative political economies like concrete alternatives but you would

45:08.800 --> 45:16.000
say that there is something to to gain when looking at specifically socialism and the communist

45:16.000 --> 45:22.560
traditions and the theoretical work and stuff like that yeah yeah sure yeah I mean that's

45:22.560 --> 45:26.880
something that I subscribe to it's not that like I call myself a socialist and I have a socialist

45:26.880 --> 45:32.240
and just as just as I'm an anti-capitalist no I was more talking about you know specific aspects

45:32.240 --> 45:36.880
of prescriptions and you know what concrete proposals you could make about how exactly to

45:36.880 --> 45:40.960
run I don't know a democratic enterprise and how to engage with the market forces when you're

45:40.960 --> 45:45.280
running a democratic enterprise these are the kinds of more detailed things that or you know

45:45.280 --> 45:49.920
how to create what would it look like exactly for the European Union to turn into a federal

45:49.920 --> 45:56.320
socialist entity which I think what is what it should turn into but I think of it as that more

45:56.320 --> 46:00.400
as a kind of democratic project that needs to be out there not I don't have a specific fully

46:00.400 --> 46:04.320
worked out conception of how exactly it needs to be reformed along those lines but I do think that

46:04.320 --> 46:08.240
it needs to be reformed along those lines so yeah that's not that's not that's not where my

46:08.240 --> 46:16.800
skepticism is coming from I see so so do you think we need some some kind of new meta narratives

46:16.800 --> 46:25.440
that are able to to carry this like pluralism of freedoms this pluralism of different ideas that

46:25.440 --> 46:31.280
will need to be kind of democratically thought out and thought out but do you do you think that

46:31.920 --> 46:36.240
that we need some some kind of carrier in terms of new meta narratives

46:38.240 --> 46:42.320
I mean I wonder what the new meta narrative would be for me it's actually very simple I think we

46:42.320 --> 46:48.160
need to be united in our rejection of the status quo as a system I think it's there is a lot

46:48.160 --> 46:53.360
packed in that but basically people need to for me as I see it maybe I'm wrong and maybe this is

46:53.360 --> 46:57.840
another thing that needs to be tested democratically but my conviction is that the sooner we give up

46:58.240 --> 47:02.720
on the possibility of reforming capitalism the better off we will be in terms of thinking about

47:02.720 --> 47:08.400
alternatives and so where you start off is by saying I want my critique of the system in which

47:08.400 --> 47:14.080
I live to be really radical and I want to aspire to a new foundation of a new system at a legal

47:14.080 --> 47:18.480
level at a political level at an economic level at a local level at a global level so it's basically

47:18.480 --> 47:24.080
a kind of alternative global outlook basically and of course this is not something that a single

47:24.080 --> 47:28.080
person can do you know and I don't think it was ever something that a single person could do so

47:28.080 --> 47:33.040
I think it's foolish to think okay but you have a theory or do you have a what hey how is it exactly

47:33.040 --> 47:38.560
how is it going to work exactly because that's you know the work of a collective but that this

47:38.560 --> 47:44.080
is the starting point to me seems very elementary and in fact you wake up every day and you look at

47:44.080 --> 47:48.800
the world and it seems pretty obvious that that's exactly what needs to happen but maybe just you

47:48.800 --> 47:54.720
know Brecht used to say the simplicity difficult to make and that's the kind of thing that we're

47:54.720 --> 48:00.480
up against in a way that is so intuitive that there should be an alternative system of social

48:00.480 --> 48:07.520
relations and one that is in a way makes good on this promise of moral world and these promises

48:07.520 --> 48:11.920
of freedom that are in all our constitutions in all our legal documents in all our political

48:11.920 --> 48:18.640
rhetoric and the discourses and then and yet fail miserably everywhere around us and I think

48:18.720 --> 48:23.680
if you just point out and in some ways the role of the book was that to point out this gap between

48:23.680 --> 48:28.000
the ideals that we all subscribe to and the realities that we're all surrounded by and the

48:28.000 --> 48:33.040
sooner we realize that there's a reason why the reality doesn't match the ideals is because we're

48:33.040 --> 48:40.560
in the wrong system the better off we will be and the experience of engaging with in some ways kind

48:40.560 --> 48:46.000
of going back to these debates around 1990 and so on is that it seems to me 1990 for all its failures

48:46.000 --> 48:51.120
and for all this the way it went wrong there was this possibility this moment this opening

48:51.120 --> 48:56.800
where people actually thought okay now we could build better and we could do there was a sort of

48:56.800 --> 49:01.040
an opening of the imagination at least in Eastern Europe maybe in the West it was never like that

49:01.040 --> 49:05.040
maybe the West always thought you know they had won and that was it but I think in Eastern Europe

49:05.040 --> 49:11.200
there was genuinely a moment of hope and thinking that now things would be different and people

49:11.200 --> 49:15.680
finally had agency just before they were then flooded with you know the shock therapy and the

49:15.680 --> 49:21.680
liberal markets and so on and it's that spirit of dissidents of the 90s coupled with the hope

49:21.680 --> 49:26.320
that the system can change for the better as opposed to for some other kind of bad

49:26.960 --> 49:30.400
that my book tries to recover and that I always try to convey.

49:31.360 --> 49:37.520
And just to maybe for the books or for the record I sense some kind of misunderstanding here my

49:37.520 --> 49:43.760
question is not so much oriented towards that the idea that I think that you have the answers or

49:43.760 --> 49:49.600
one answer anything as such I'm perfectly aware of that it's not one person that will have this

49:49.600 --> 49:57.360
answer but I'm still very much interested in kind of what are the agents in very much in plural the

49:57.360 --> 50:06.720
communities the movements the collectives and the metanarratives that that will together form

50:08.160 --> 50:16.400
some kind of carrier that will then move forward from the point of recognizing that the status quo

50:16.400 --> 50:22.240
is perfectly fucked up and you need to change it. Right right so I think I mean there's two stories

50:22.240 --> 50:28.320
there it's either those who experience it or those who reflect on it right so there are some

50:28.320 --> 50:33.760
who will experience the failings and the oppression on their skin right they will have it it will be

50:33.760 --> 50:38.160
part of their day-to-day lives that the way in which the system misdelivers for them or the way

50:38.160 --> 50:41.760
in which system betrays them or the way in which it doesn't realize their freedoms so there will

50:41.760 --> 50:48.640
be a sense in which the agents are the victims of the system but there's another part in which

50:48.640 --> 50:53.280
I think it's also important that other you know Kant would have called them impartial spectators

50:53.280 --> 50:58.320
there's a lot of people out there who may not necessarily be victims but who may reflect on the

50:58.320 --> 51:03.280
plight of those who are victims and who are engaging with the kinds of injustice and the

51:03.280 --> 51:08.400
kinds of oppressions that there are and they are also agents and so there is this you know debate

51:08.400 --> 51:13.360
amongst marxists on class consciousness and whether you know it's something in itself or for itself

51:13.360 --> 51:19.120
whether something you can develop or something you need to be born with and I think I'm very open

51:19.120 --> 51:24.240
on that debate I don't think that you have to be a victim of oppression yourself to be able to have

51:24.240 --> 51:30.000
an interest in emancipation along those lines you can also just engage with it and see and there's

51:30.000 --> 51:36.960
different points from which you can engage with it but yeah so I think the agents can be constructed

51:36.960 --> 51:43.600
by reflecting and by diagnosing the wrongs of the world and by looking at the gaps and the cracks in

51:43.600 --> 51:48.640
the system and the failures and you know different in this plural sites of struggle you know there

51:48.640 --> 51:52.560
will be workers there will be environmental crises there will be financial credit all the

51:52.560 --> 51:58.960
different crises that we encounter will each of them produce the agents that are necessary to go

51:58.960 --> 52:04.320
beyond the status quo and to try and think about the future in the right way and then

52:04.320 --> 52:08.800
there's a last question that I ask all of my guests which is if you think about the future

52:08.800 --> 52:14.800
what makes you joyful yeah and there is an answer I always give when I get answered that question

52:14.800 --> 52:20.480
which is that I am a Kantian and I have a duty to hope and so I don't have to there doesn't have

52:20.480 --> 52:28.000
to be anything but in the world makes me hopeful because I think hope is a duty and to the extent

52:28.000 --> 52:32.080
that you have reason and to the extent that you're engaging and you're in the world and you're

52:32.080 --> 52:37.440
trying to do things then there is no alternative to being hopeful you can't carry on if you're

52:37.440 --> 52:41.520
not hopeful and so you know the question of is there anything in the world that makes me

52:41.520 --> 52:45.360
hopeful or not it's I don't know it doesn't matter it's not it's not important to me that

52:45.360 --> 52:48.640
can be nothing it could be a desert it could be horrible and I would still be hopeful

52:49.360 --> 52:55.040
