00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
It is absolutely incredible that economic concepts and tool sets are being implemented

00:09.760 --> 00:15.840
deeply into computational processes and into network security processes.

00:15.840 --> 00:24.320
I think this is actually quite a big deal, intellectually, technically, philosophically.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.760
It is quite a big deal.

00:25.760 --> 00:31.560
I first realized this when I went to a Bitcoin conference a while back and it was really

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
interesting.

00:32.560 --> 00:39.200
I was like, wow, it's basically cryptographers that are discussing economics.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.840
Cryptographers discussing economics.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.800
That's a perfect start for today's episode.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.680

Welcome to Future Histories.

01:51.960 --> 01:56.560
My name is Jan Groß and my guest today is Dr. Jaya Clara Brecke.

01:56.560 --> 02:01.680
She's a researcher investigating what matters politically in blockchain technology at Derham

02:01.680 --> 02:03.120
University.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.120
Welcome Jaya.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.120
Hi.

02:05.120 --> 02:09.720
I think most of my listeners will have heard of the term blockchain at some point, but

02:09.720 --> 02:14.920
I think there's still actually considerable confusion and quite a lot of mysticism around

02:14.920 --> 02:16.240
the technology.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.120
So let's cover the basics first.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.680
What is a blockchain and what types of blockchains are there?

02:21.680 --> 02:28.360
Okay, so the way I tend to explain blockchain is I actually I go back to cryptography and

02:28.360 --> 02:33.400
I go back to starting off with explaining what cryptographic hashing is for those who

02:33.400 --> 02:34.640
are not familiar.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.640
So essentially, you know, this is a mathematical process where you take some data, you put

02:39.640 --> 02:45.080
it through this process and it spits out a string of numbers or a string of numbers and

02:45.080 --> 02:49.200
letters, characters, whatever kind of hashing algorithm you're using.

02:49.200 --> 02:57.000
And this has a very particular set of characteristics, which are extremely useful because only the

02:57.000 --> 03:01.460
exact same data would spit out that particular string of numbers.

03:01.460 --> 03:06.760
So what that means is that if anything in the data changes, you can detect that by running

03:06.760 --> 03:10.320
the hashing algorithm again, and if it doesn't spit out the same number, then you know something

03:10.320 --> 03:11.560
has been tampered with.

03:12.520 --> 03:18.320
It's a very useful way of verifying the integrity of data.

03:18.320 --> 03:26.480
So you add a timestamp to this and you string this together in a chain of hashed data.

03:26.480 --> 03:31.560
And what you essentially potentially have is a linear history of, you know, things that

03:31.560 --> 03:36.560
have changed over time or, you know, sets of data over time.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.800
So that's essentially, you know, the kind of blockchain in terms of kind of data structure.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.920
But then there is the question of how do you, if you want to have this taking place in a

03:45.920 --> 03:51.300
decentralized network, how does the decentralized network come to an agreement around what data

03:51.300 --> 03:55.400
should be added and hashed into this chain in the first place?

03:55.400 --> 04:00.500
So how do we come to an agreement about what has happened, you know, in a given context?

04:00.500 --> 04:03.560
In the case of Bitcoin, what has happened in terms of transactions?

04:03.560 --> 04:07.160
In the case of Ethereum, what has happened in terms of computation?

04:07.160 --> 04:10.080
But it could be any potential data.

04:10.080 --> 04:15.320
So that consensus mechanism is what's called proof of work in Bitcoin and in many other

04:15.320 --> 04:16.680
cryptocurrencies.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.200
There are other consensus protocols.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.120
I'm going to explain the one that Bitcoin uses.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.520
That's the kind of starting point, let's say.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.840
But you also have things like proof of stake.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.040
You have things like proof of importance and proof of cooperation.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.440
So the way the consensus protocol takes place in Bitcoin is the network competes on grouping

04:34.440 --> 04:41.640
together the transactions into blocks and running it through a hashing process that

04:41.640 --> 04:46.040
needs to spit out a number that meets certain requirements.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.920
If it does not spit out that number meeting certain requirements, then they have not successfully

04:49.920 --> 04:50.920
mined a block yet.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.600
So they need to try again.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.520
And by trying again, they basically just add a nonce, which is a random number to the data

04:58.160 --> 05:03.960
until the random number that they add to the data affects the output string of number in

05:03.960 --> 05:08.360
such a way so that it meets the requirements.

05:08.360 --> 05:15.960
So what is it we have here is actually a quite profound shift in understanding around the

05:15.960 --> 05:22.000
word consensus and an understanding around how a network reaches consensus.

05:22.040 --> 05:30.040
Because if we think about this as a model for governance, this is a model for agreeing

05:30.040 --> 05:38.240
about what actually happened, you have gone from previous models that could be a political

05:38.240 --> 05:42.200
leader decides what's true or not, a judge decides what's true or not, a religious leader

05:42.200 --> 05:49.920
decides what's true or not, or science or some kind of philosophical understanding of

05:49.960 --> 05:56.920
truth of events and so on to a system which is essentially, you know, the way that it

05:56.920 --> 06:02.400
decides what's happened, the way that it's decided what's true is through randomized

06:02.400 --> 06:10.200
turns that is that is incentivized through rewards.

06:10.200 --> 06:17.360
So you have a competition to be the one to define which transactions are considered valid

06:17.360 --> 06:21.560
or what data is considered valid for that round.

06:21.560 --> 06:26.480
So you have all these, you know, this whole network of computers that are taking turns

06:26.480 --> 06:33.080
that are competing with each other to be the next intern to define the truth for that next

06:33.080 --> 06:34.560
block.

06:34.560 --> 06:39.160
That is essentially the kind of Bitcoin consensus protocol.

06:39.160 --> 06:45.160
So blockchain technology did have very political goals from the start, and one of them actually

06:45.160 --> 06:49.800
being the goal of overcoming politics altogether.

06:49.800 --> 06:56.160
How did you approach the question of the political in your work on blockchain technology?

06:56.160 --> 07:01.160
So first of all, it was really kind of working that out, you know, understanding, you know,

07:01.160 --> 07:10.280
where what's really kind of the underlying ideas that gave rise to this technology.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.400
And from that, I really, you know, I articulated this thing that actually, you know, what seems

07:15.400 --> 07:21.840
to be happening here is an attempt at a kind of technical fix, a technical solution to

07:21.840 --> 07:23.560
the problem of the political.

07:23.560 --> 07:31.440
So if we understand the political as basically the negotiation of incompatible differences

07:31.440 --> 07:35.880
through lots of different means, that would be one definition.

07:36.240 --> 07:41.040
What you have here is a technology that tries to kind of resolve that in some kind of final

07:41.040 --> 07:42.040
manner.

07:42.040 --> 07:46.840
So, you know, you take the problem of power and authority that will be replaced by a decentralized

07:46.840 --> 07:47.840
network.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.720
So problem of authority has been solved.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.600
The problem of consensus between, you know, incompatible positions, well, we've got an

07:54.600 --> 07:58.680
algorithm that will do that and an algorithm that will do that in a way that's decentralized,

07:58.680 --> 08:04.200
meaning no one can control it, which means that it can be considered somewhat, can be

08:04.240 --> 08:06.880
considered neutral.

08:06.880 --> 08:11.840
And then we have the problem of how to enforce that and secure the system.

08:11.840 --> 08:18.240
And, you know, code will enforce it and cryptography will secure the system from any kind of

08:18.240 --> 08:20.520
attacks or manipulation.

08:20.520 --> 08:25.240
So the idea is like these components somehow resolve the problem of the political in some

08:25.240 --> 08:27.560
kind of final way.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.800
So a lot of my work, I guess, was partially kind of untangling where do these ideas come

08:32.800 --> 08:40.960
from and how are they sought to be kind of like written and encoded and what's that

08:40.960 --> 08:46.040
process, what has that process looked like?

08:46.040 --> 08:53.000
And also to look at kind of, you know, there's lots of different theories around like understanding

08:53.000 --> 08:54.360
the politics of technology.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.920
One of them is, you know, really understands the political as something that then gets

08:59.000 --> 09:04.360
inscribed into a piece of technology or an infrastructure so that a certain kind of politics

09:04.360 --> 09:10.440
or ethics will be operating in a kind of imminent manner.

09:10.440 --> 09:16.920
So, you know, say, for example, for me, like a really good example is the door closer that

09:16.920 --> 09:21.160
I think Bruno Latour uses and is, you know, one kind of easy way of understanding this

09:21.160 --> 09:26.280
principle, which is basically like a door closer will automatically close the door and

09:26.280 --> 09:31.920
that enforces a certain kind of understanding that the door being closed is good, whereas

09:31.920 --> 09:34.340
the door remaining open is bad.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.920
So therefore we have this door closer that's now going to continue to enforce that regardless

09:38.920 --> 09:43.000
of what we feel about it or not.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.760
Of course, the door closer is radically different from a complex network because the door closer,

09:48.760 --> 09:53.760
if you disagree with it, you just kind of like put something to block it from working

09:53.840 --> 09:59.040
or you pick it apart or whatever else, it's quite easy to change those conditions.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.200
And it's also quite easy to see what exactly is enforcing those conditions, where in complex

10:04.200 --> 10:10.320
network technology, sometimes it's pretty hard to understand where and why something

10:10.320 --> 10:14.720
turns out the way it turns out and how to fix that.

10:14.720 --> 10:19.600
And it requires certain skills to understand that and requires certain skills to tinker

10:19.600 --> 10:21.440
with it.

10:21.440 --> 10:27.960
Of course, in blockchain and in the kind of open source movement, that problem is attempted

10:27.960 --> 10:32.280
to be addressed by actually making things open source and trying to kind of explain

10:32.280 --> 10:35.320
systems and involve people in a variety of ways.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.880
And that's like a very positive side of the culture.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.840
But I think I lost my thread there a little bit.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.360
I don't mind.

10:45.360 --> 10:51.080
It's good because you pointed towards you looking at the history of network cultures

10:51.080 --> 10:57.560
actually in order to understand how this, you call it blockchain sensibility, got formed

10:57.560 --> 11:00.080
the way it is.

11:00.080 --> 11:05.840
And I think you did a very good job in pointing out that we should definitely take a second

11:05.840 --> 11:13.840
look and that both the evangelists, like the blockchain evangelists, should get away from

11:13.840 --> 11:16.320
easy dichotomies, but also the critics.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
Yeah.

11:17.320 --> 11:22.600
I mean, so because what I was observing was obviously, you know, the people that are attracted

11:22.600 --> 11:26.040
to blockchain come from a variety of different backgrounds.

11:26.040 --> 11:31.200
I mean, it's really attracted a lot of people from across different political spectrums

11:31.200 --> 11:35.920
and across different kinds of political cultures and histories.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.940
And so to me, it just seemed like, you know, although I think like some of the criticisms

11:41.100 --> 11:48.340
that have come, that does analyze, you know, especially things like Bitcoin and so on as,

11:48.340 --> 11:55.180
you know, a kind of right wing capitalist kind of project or a narco capitalist project,

11:55.180 --> 11:58.660
you know, sure, there's certain truth to that, but it just didn't seem to be telling the

11:58.660 --> 11:59.660
entire story.

11:59.660 --> 12:07.140
And it was telling a very kind of US centric history of blockchain to analyze it just on

12:07.140 --> 12:08.140
those terms.

12:08.140 --> 12:10.820
And I was trying to understand what else was going on or what was missing from that

12:10.820 --> 12:15.980
picture because I was observing people really from lots of different political backgrounds

12:15.980 --> 12:18.700
getting involved.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.420
And so for me, it was more interesting to look at the kind of like history of decentralization

12:22.420 --> 12:28.460
and peer to peer and look at some of the kind of practical problems that different technologies

12:28.460 --> 12:30.500
have been trying to solve.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.940
And one of them, I mean, really, you know, like the kind of history of peer to peer in

12:34.980 --> 12:39.460
terms of network cultures really has been about authority and it really has been about

12:39.460 --> 12:45.580
how can we create networks that even if like one person gets arrested or one server gets

12:45.580 --> 12:52.340
taken down, the network itself can still continue to function and can still continue to operate.

12:52.340 --> 12:59.060
And these were kind of pragmatic problems, you know, that the piracy movement or anti

12:59.500 --> 13:01.860
copyright movement has been dealing with.

13:01.860 --> 13:06.260
You know, these are problems that like, you know, different kind of, you know, indie media

13:06.260 --> 13:09.260
type projects have been dealing with.

13:09.260 --> 13:14.660
You know, it's really this question of, or this, let's say, using decentralization as

13:14.660 --> 13:18.940
a way to circumvent authorities, you know.

13:18.940 --> 13:24.700
So but what for me was interesting was some things have changed from the early history

13:24.700 --> 13:30.940
of peer to peer to, you know, where we're now at with blockchain technology.

13:30.940 --> 13:35.580
And a lot of that has to do with kind of like a shift in understanding where instead of

13:35.580 --> 13:42.580
using peer to peer or decentralization as a kind of specific strategy for specific political

13:43.700 --> 13:50.060
projects or purposes, it becomes a kind of abstract political aim in itself.

13:50.060 --> 13:55.100
And that's where I think like this idea or this kind of illusion of like having resolved

13:55.100 --> 13:59.940
the problem of the political in some kind of final manner comes about, right.

13:59.940 --> 14:05.980
And it's also where, to be honest, I think like, you know, by abstracting these things,

14:05.980 --> 14:12.980
that's why you see something like Ethereum being able to appeal to, you know, financial

14:12.980 --> 14:18.980
industries plus governments plus activists plus, you know, pretty much anybody or anything

14:19.100 --> 14:24.100
because this thing has been taken out of it, right.

14:24.100 --> 14:28.540
It becomes this kind of like generalized abstract thing where there's no, yeah, the kind of

14:28.540 --> 14:32.640
political project is abstracted, let's say.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.940
So everyone can see a certain kind of way of potentially using these technologies for

14:36.940 --> 14:40.980
some efficiency gains or whatever else.

14:40.980 --> 14:47.980
But for me, yeah, for me, there's like something strange that happens with that abstraction

14:49.060 --> 14:56.060
where kind of grounded understanding of what's in operation with the technology is lost.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.300
And I'm trying to, so what I'm trying to do in the thesis is give, you know, some access

15:01.300 --> 15:03.820
points to that.

15:03.820 --> 15:10.820
And actually, it feels as if a specific type of looking at the world is actually generalized.

15:12.540 --> 15:18.540
And when I was reading your thesis, I had to think about like how it reminded me of

15:18.740 --> 15:25.740
how game theory was invented in the sociopolitical arena of Cold War politics in a very specific

15:28.660 --> 15:30.860
context.

15:30.860 --> 15:37.860
And then it kind of got generalized as well, kind of similar to the way that Ethereum kind

15:39.580 --> 15:46.580
of set the scene to generalize this very specific understanding that comes out of like decentralized

15:47.580 --> 15:51.420
security modeling, actually.

15:51.420 --> 15:58.420
And I was wondering, because I mean, that might be unfair again, you know, but kind

15:58.540 --> 16:05.540
of it felt as if the same type of paranoia-ish looking on the world is generalized in game

16:09.380 --> 16:10.980
theory in the first place.

16:10.980 --> 16:17.980
And then a technology like Ethereum comes along and kind of builds and technological

16:17.980 --> 16:23.980
infrastructure to generalize it in technical terms as well.

16:23.980 --> 16:27.540
Yeah, absolutely. And it's, you know, there's a whole set of kind of strange contradictions

16:27.540 --> 16:28.340
at play here.

16:28.340 --> 16:34.300
So you're right. I mean, what I'm tracing in my PhD also is like the set of problems

16:34.300 --> 16:41.300
that come about when you create a decentralized network, the set of technical problems, which,

16:41.500 --> 16:48.500
you know, in terms of network security is this issue that, you know, in a truly decentralized

16:49.820 --> 16:55.620
network, anyone can potentially be an adversary, right?

16:55.620 --> 17:01.400
And so, you know, a lot of that idea of like how do you secure against the fact that anyone

17:01.400 --> 17:06.080
can potentially be an adversary does feed into the kind of like general understanding

17:06.080 --> 17:13.080
of the world really is like, you know, trying to eliminate trust, you know, trying to solve

17:13.080 --> 17:18.360
the trust problem, which is like, you know, how big or how blockchain tends to be understood

17:18.360 --> 17:19.800
these days.

17:19.800 --> 17:26.800
But it's like very fuzzy, the exact limits to where things are being solved or what's

17:27.400 --> 17:33.040
being solved here exactly, because in each and every moment, there is so much trust involved.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.760
You know, you've got to, you know, there's no one that has actually gone through and

17:36.760 --> 17:43.020
audited every single piece of code or understood every single piece of, you know, cryptographic

17:43.020 --> 17:48.220
hashing algorithm that's being used and verified themselves as a single individual.

17:48.220 --> 17:54.440
You know, there are obviously communities of trust in a real sense, even in blockchain

17:54.440 --> 17:58.120
technologies in so-called, you know, trustless networks.

17:58.120 --> 18:04.720
So like, yeah, there is this kind of imagination or this ideal that like ultimate, you know,

18:04.720 --> 18:11.480
the ultimate system is a system where nobody needs to be trusted.

18:11.480 --> 18:18.760
And that's kind of necessary to reach this ideal of a secure decentralized system replacing

18:18.760 --> 18:20.880
authorities.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.760
But in actual fact, the way it plays out doesn't quite look that way.

18:24.760 --> 18:32.000
It just, there's a kind of reconfiguration of how trust operates.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.160
There was something else I wanted to say on that, but it slipped my mind now.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.120
I'm sure it'll come up in a different form.

18:37.120 --> 18:43.800
Well, yeah, and I think I'll have a good point to get into it, because you describe four

18:43.800 --> 18:50.640
principles of blockchain technology and afterwards you have a short paragraph where you let the

18:50.640 --> 18:56.760
reader know how different the way the terms are being used actually is.

18:56.760 --> 19:02.040
I mean, you just said it in relation to trust, but actually it's in relation to decentralization

19:02.040 --> 19:04.040
as well and consensus and stuff.

19:04.040 --> 19:10.720
So could you maybe explain the four principles and how the way these terms are being used

19:10.720 --> 19:17.120
is actually quite counterintuitive to the way we use it in like everyday language?

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
Yeah.

19:18.720 --> 19:25.320
Yeah, so I guess, so what I'm saying in this section is trying to kind of compare, like

19:25.320 --> 19:36.200
you say, how we understand some of these terms, trust, openness, decentralization, and immutability

19:36.200 --> 19:44.080
quite differently in our social lives than what becomes technically articulated and how

19:44.160 --> 19:48.680
that technical articulation then becomes a kind of certain view of the world or a certain

19:48.680 --> 19:52.360
kind of understanding of the world.

19:52.360 --> 19:58.000
So generally speaking in social life, more trust is a good thing, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:05.640
If we create kind of more trust between us, that's a good thing.

20:05.640 --> 20:13.040
Whereas in kind of blockchain, trust is considered something that needs to be eliminated entirely.

20:13.440 --> 20:19.080
In some ways, there's some interesting dynamics that I don't think I go into so much in this

20:19.080 --> 20:30.760
paragraph about that, but about how that's in many ways a kind of feature of lots of

20:30.760 --> 20:36.840
different aspects of technology and scientific devices in general, that we trust the observation

20:37.640 --> 20:44.480
of a measuring device more than we would trust someone's account of it.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.800
So take like temperature measurements, for example, it's like someone's like, oh, this

20:49.800 --> 20:54.840
feels really, really hot, and it's like, no, the thermometer says it's only 20 degrees

20:54.840 --> 21:00.520
outside or things like this where there's like a certain kind of, we assign a certain

21:00.600 --> 21:09.640
kind of validity to the return of certain kinds of technical instruments and apparatuses

21:09.640 --> 21:15.000
more so than our kind of common experiences.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.560
I mean, that's not to pit the kind of human against the machine in any kind of way.

21:18.560 --> 21:24.280
It's just an observation about how devices and apparatuses sometimes operate.

21:24.280 --> 21:30.160
And I say it only because it's such a major, major part of the political proposition of

21:30.160 --> 21:40.360
blockchain to create a kind of governance apparatus, essentially, that is somehow constructed

21:40.360 --> 21:44.040
by a set of elements that are beyond the control of human beings.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.160
And that's like the explicit aim.

21:46.160 --> 21:51.320
That's the kind of that's the political aim of the project, really.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.600
So let's go into that.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.940
What's the role of algorithmic governance in blockchain technology?

21:56.940 --> 22:04.060
So what is the narrative around it and what are the narratives of future that are connected

22:04.060 --> 22:05.060
to it?

22:05.060 --> 22:14.980
Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand entirely the question, if you can make it more specific.

22:14.980 --> 22:22.340
Well, you kind of said right now that one of the main purposes of blockchain technology

22:22.340 --> 22:35.380
is being a technology for governance purposes in order to provide a different way to actually

22:35.380 --> 22:37.940
organize society as a whole, you know?

22:37.940 --> 22:45.260
And so there's a narrative, a political narrative connected to this technology that is tightly

22:45.260 --> 22:49.740
coupled to the idea of algorithmic governance.

22:49.740 --> 22:50.820
What's the idea behind it?

22:50.820 --> 22:56.300
How do they want to use algorithmic governance to reorganize society?

22:56.300 --> 23:02.820
Yeah, I mean, so, you know, one point that I've been making a lot throughout my thesis

23:02.820 --> 23:07.540
in the kind of not just in the written piece, but also in the talks that I've been giving

23:07.540 --> 23:14.860
and so on, is this kind of irony or this kind of this observation that like peer-to-peer

23:14.860 --> 23:20.320
technology, you know, there's a lot of focus on this ambition of disintermediation, right?

23:20.320 --> 23:26.680
To get rid of the kind of intermediary, the middleman, so that we can have kind of direct

23:26.680 --> 23:29.040
relations with one another.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.520
And so for transactions, that would be like, let's get rid of the banks and the governments

23:32.520 --> 23:37.880
so that we can just exchange value directly between each other without anyone, you know,

23:37.880 --> 23:43.880
either controlling whether we can do that or not, or like the surveillance and gathering

23:43.880 --> 23:47.840
information about us and our transactions.

23:47.840 --> 23:52.120
And so there's like this focus on disintermediation and getting rid of the middleman.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.360
But then on this kind of like political ambition, I mean, you look at this thing and it's like

23:56.360 --> 24:01.200
the most incredible, like the most intense form of intermediation you can imagine when

24:01.200 --> 24:03.760
it comes to questions of governance, right?

24:03.760 --> 24:11.120
We're bringing together like, you know, networks and algorithms and protocols and game theory

24:11.120 --> 24:16.160
and market dynamics and you name it, all into this kind of like some kind of apparatus that

24:16.240 --> 24:24.200
is supposed to kind of sit between all of us and enforce some kind of consensus between

24:24.200 --> 24:25.720
all of us.

24:25.720 --> 24:33.000
So it's this very intense form of intermediation, actually, and a hugely complex form of intermediation.

24:33.000 --> 24:41.880
Yeah, so on the question of algorithmic governance, it's so, I mean, with blockchain, I think

24:41.920 --> 24:47.720
I mentioned already in the definition how, you know, the technology looks to solve the

24:47.720 --> 24:49.960
problem of the political.

24:49.960 --> 24:54.280
And so you have, you know, something like, you know, you have consensus algorithms that

24:54.280 --> 24:57.560
organize consensus amongst nodes in the network.

24:57.560 --> 25:04.720
But also, you've got things like decentralized autonomous organizations, you've got things

25:04.720 --> 25:07.360
like smart contracts.

25:07.360 --> 25:16.480
So ways of trying to kind of automate certain aspects of governance and contractual relationships,

25:16.480 --> 25:21.440
let's say, so that they once again cannot be controlled by any single individual, but

25:21.440 --> 25:26.520
that run, you know, across a kind of decentralized network.

25:26.520 --> 25:30.880
And there's lots of kind of directions that people imagine this going in.

25:30.960 --> 25:38.120
And so, you know, the kind of like fantasy, which is both the kind of like dystopian fantasy,

25:38.120 --> 25:41.680
but also something that you see people in the blockchain space talk about with like

25:41.680 --> 25:47.240
really kind of like feverish bright eyes is this, you know, this combination of blockchain

25:47.240 --> 25:53.520
with AI, you know, that, you know, will have, you know, AI emerge, which will be this kind

25:53.520 --> 26:05.600
of like, yeah, perfect, scary, non-human, but amazingly mathematical intelligence that

26:05.600 --> 26:14.720
will use the kind of power of cryptography and the kind of uncontrollable, uncontrollability,

26:14.720 --> 26:20.680
unstoppable ability of smart contracts to basically run the world.

26:20.840 --> 26:27.600
And specifically in terms of this narrative for future, there has been some setbacks to

26:27.600 --> 26:29.560
say it mildly.

26:29.560 --> 26:36.800
So there was a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, as you mentioned, in Ethereum,

26:36.800 --> 26:38.480
on the Ethereum blockchain.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.880
And there was a lot of hype around it.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.280
And at some point it got hacked.

26:44.280 --> 26:52.000
And actually, what followed then was some kind of reflection about the limits of this

26:52.000 --> 26:53.840
kind of thinking.

26:53.840 --> 27:02.400
And for some, it was like a, I think it was just the lesson that we just didn't do it

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
good enough yet.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.400
Yeah.

27:04.400 --> 27:09.640
And for others, they thought, all right, well, this showed us actually that it's not just

27:09.640 --> 27:16.240
a deterministic world we're living in that can be handled in this kind of way, but there

27:16.240 --> 27:22.240
are different aspects, like social aspects and stuff that have to be considered in this

27:22.240 --> 27:23.240
kind of thing.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.240
Yeah.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.240
Yeah.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.080
So I write quite a bit about that event in my thesis also.

27:28.080 --> 27:37.520
I mean, the problem is, so, you know, the story of blockchain and what it can do and

27:37.520 --> 27:43.760
the story of blockchain plus AI, you know, these things, they sound so convincing.

27:43.760 --> 27:47.400
But one of the main reasons why they're so convincing is because when you kind of, when

27:47.400 --> 27:51.600
you look at the story, you're looking only at the story and you forget to look at everything

27:51.600 --> 27:56.560
outside of it, when actually everything outside of it really matters for how that story will

27:56.560 --> 27:58.720
play out in reality.

27:58.720 --> 28:06.300
And to take a very basic example, this idea of a kind of, you know, blockchain system

28:06.540 --> 28:13.740
that runs entirely without authorities, you know, at some point, someone had to write

28:13.740 --> 28:16.740
that protocol, right?

28:16.740 --> 28:22.340
And so that someone, you know, or those groups of people, in essence, have then written the

28:22.340 --> 28:25.340
rules of society, right?

28:25.340 --> 28:29.100
If indeed this thing was going to continue to run without it being controlled or without

28:29.100 --> 28:33.180
it being kind of modified and so on.

28:33.180 --> 28:39.100
But also what happens is in reality, not only has someone or people writing protocols,

28:39.100 --> 28:43.740
but also the protocols need to be maintained and updated and things break and nothing is

28:43.740 --> 28:45.140
ever written perfectly.

28:45.140 --> 28:53.100
And, you know, so there is this kind of like real kind of difference or real gap between

28:53.100 --> 29:03.180
the kind of the perfect ideal that somehow kind of, you know, mathematics, cryptography

29:03.180 --> 29:07.300
and technical systems, you know, they give us this kind of mental image of something

29:07.300 --> 29:13.740
that is perfectly neatly organized, perfectly rational and perfectly objective, when in

29:13.740 --> 29:17.740
actual fact, like that's a kind of it's a mental image of it.

29:17.740 --> 29:21.900
Whenever people actually write these things down, obviously, like it exists as part of

29:21.900 --> 29:28.580
a kind of far more complex world where lots of other dynamics play into how a system

29:28.580 --> 29:32.300
will actually operate and the actual effects of a system.

29:32.300 --> 29:38.780
And so what happened in the DAO attack was, you know, there was this decentralized autonomous

29:38.780 --> 29:44.620
organization and it was supposed to be governed purely and only by the rules written in its

29:44.620 --> 29:47.380
smart contract.

29:47.380 --> 29:51.860
And this smart contract lived in a decentralized network and no one was supposed to be able

29:51.860 --> 29:56.700
to modify it or change it after it had been deployed.

29:56.700 --> 30:02.700
So it was deployed and lots of people invested in the decentralized autonomous organization,

30:02.700 --> 30:04.700
I think up to 60 million dollars.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.540
No, more than that.

30:06.540 --> 30:09.580
I think over 100 million dollars.

30:09.580 --> 30:17.380
And then all of a sudden people saw that there was an amount of investment that was being

30:17.700 --> 30:22.540
taken out of the DAO contract repeatedly.

30:22.540 --> 30:28.980
And so it turned out that in the contract code, this was possible through a kind of

30:28.980 --> 30:33.980
combination of a couple of different rules that had been specified in the contract.

30:33.980 --> 30:40.380
And someone was literally emptying the fund and got away with about 60 million dollars.

30:40.380 --> 30:46.040
And the reactions to that were, you know, kind of split the community.

30:46.040 --> 30:53.720
So some people felt like, you know, this needed to be stopped.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.680
This should never have happened.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.520
We should intervene.

30:57.520 --> 31:02.760
And another set of people were like, no, because the rules said that only the smart contracts

31:02.760 --> 31:03.800
governs this thing.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.520
And so therefore, if what's written in the smart contract is the only thing that governs

31:07.520 --> 31:13.400
it and it allows for this person to actually or this hacker to actually siphon off this

31:13.520 --> 31:16.880
money, that should be allowed to go ahead.

31:16.880 --> 31:23.760
And so what you saw was, you know, the Ethereum Foundation got quite concerned and got involved

31:23.760 --> 31:31.680
because this was a considerable amount of the actual total amount of ether in the market.

31:31.680 --> 31:38.200
And so they decided to go in and intervene and basically do what's called, I guess you

31:38.280 --> 31:47.680
could call it a kind of rollback on the Ethereum blockchain and fork the blockchain so that

31:47.680 --> 31:52.320
before the hack attacked and kind of pretend that in the history of the Ethereum blockchain,

31:52.320 --> 32:00.200
this hack had never actually happened to then buy time to go in and retrieve the funds.

32:00.200 --> 32:05.760
And that's like a clear act of a kind of outside authority in a sense, right?

32:05.760 --> 32:09.080
And so there was a lot of like soul searching in the community about whether or not that

32:09.080 --> 32:15.760
was a good thing or not, whether that should be possible at all.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.520
And it did split the community.

32:17.520 --> 32:21.800
And so you have two different versions of Ethereum running now, one that has a history

32:21.800 --> 32:26.200
of events where this hack never happened, and one that has a history of events where

32:26.200 --> 32:29.120
it did happen.

32:29.760 --> 32:39.000
And so for some people in the Ethereum community, the way of making sense of this in terms of

32:39.000 --> 32:46.680
decentralization and so on, was to say that social consensus trumps computational consensus.

32:46.680 --> 32:54.480
So this idea that like it was actually okay for the Ethereum Foundation to step in and

32:54.480 --> 32:59.480
retrieve the funds by forking the chain because there was agreement, there was broad agreement

32:59.480 --> 33:02.760
in the community that that was what needed to be done.

33:02.760 --> 33:14.480
And that agreement was expressed through the adoption of nodes in the network of this new

33:14.480 --> 33:17.000
version of the Ethereum blockchain.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.240
So in many ways, you could say there was a decentralized consensus around moving forward

33:21.240 --> 33:29.040
on that decision, although there was a kind of another splinter group that disagreed.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.200
So there's lots of stuff going on here.

33:31.200 --> 33:40.440
But what I think really kind of was very nicely kind of demonstrated to the community was

33:40.440 --> 33:48.680
that you don't get rid of the complexity of the world, you don't get rid of human beings,

33:48.680 --> 33:50.720
you don't get rid of all these things so easily.

33:50.720 --> 33:55.680
And they actually play a pretty important role for how systems play out.

33:55.680 --> 34:03.480
Like there's no there's no final guarantee against like against the indeterminate reality

34:03.480 --> 34:07.720
that we live in, you know, things kind of unfold.

34:07.720 --> 34:12.000
I mean, yeah, there's there's so many ways of kind of saying this.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.120
And I keep saying it that, you know, this idea of a kind of final solution to the problem

34:20.120 --> 34:24.200
of the political, it's I mean, it's cute.

34:24.200 --> 34:27.480
And I understand where it's coming from.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.040
But really, you know, cryptography doesn't do that.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.320
There is nothing that does that.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.960
I mean, time keeps passing.

34:32.960 --> 34:37.760
And between us, there's just too many, there's there's too many unknowns in the universe.

34:37.800 --> 34:42.720
It's like it's a radically open future, you know, and you take something like cryptography

34:42.720 --> 34:49.840
that is that is really, let's say, the the cornerstone of this political or this kind

34:49.840 --> 34:58.000
of belief system in blockchain, this idea of like the, you know, the security of cryptography

34:58.000 --> 35:04.760
being like something fixed and something something determined, you know, that we can somehow

35:04.800 --> 35:10.920
build everything else on top of, you know, I went to I went to Bletchley Park the other

35:10.920 --> 35:17.400
day, which is I don't know if people know what that is, but it's it's where Alan Turing

35:17.400 --> 35:22.440
and a bunch of other English mathematicians got together during the Second World War to

35:22.440 --> 35:27.440
break the Lorenz, the German Lorenz cipher machine.

35:27.440 --> 35:32.520
And a few of them did and invented the Colossus in order to do that.

35:32.520 --> 35:37.800
And it's you know, it's a very good it's a very kind of historical reminder and an epic

35:37.800 --> 35:43.520
reminder of the fact that cryptography, you know, is is never final.

35:43.520 --> 35:49.640
You know, it can be broken and and it is repeatedly broken and it's an ongoing process.

35:49.640 --> 35:55.040
Cryptography is very interesting to use in different kinds of systems design because,

35:55.040 --> 36:01.360
yes, it does buy you time and it has some incredible properties, but but it doesn't

36:01.360 --> 36:04.360
resolve things in any final in any final way.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.560
It's not bulletproof.

36:06.560 --> 36:13.440
It's just another device that we humans have invented in our engagement with with the kind

36:13.440 --> 36:17.520
of elements of the universe that we live in, you know, with the mathematics that we that

36:17.520 --> 36:21.320
we've kind of developed. Yeah.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.520
That was a lot.

36:24.240 --> 36:32.720
That's good. And actually, there's a there's another element that kind of undermines this

36:32.720 --> 36:36.840
perception of blockchain technology being a truth machine.

36:36.840 --> 36:43.800
In your thesis, there's a part where you describe this actually quite fitting.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.800
I'll just quote it.

36:44.800 --> 36:49.440
Actually, I think if we take a closer look at how double spending is solved and how consensus

36:49.440 --> 36:54.520
is arrived at in decentralized networks, there is, in fact, no need to determine which

36:54.520 --> 36:59.600
of the conflicting transactions is true because from the perspective of the system, it does

36:59.600 --> 37:03.640
not matter which is verified as long as it is just one of them.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.080
What is true or really happened is not of importance.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.080
End quote.

37:08.080 --> 37:13.200
So I really like that because the consensus this means that means that the consensus in

37:13.240 --> 37:19.840
blockchain is actually far from being any kind of objective truth, but it is what you

37:19.840 --> 37:23.480
later call an incentive driven settlement.

37:23.480 --> 37:30.960
And I think this is very spot on because it kind of begs the question, how does this affect

37:30.960 --> 37:34.520
the the the kinds of truths?

37:34.520 --> 37:36.080
Is that the plural of truth?

37:36.080 --> 37:42.200
I don't know the truths that that can be produced because I'm actually like one hundred percent

37:42.240 --> 37:50.080
sure that there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many truths that cannot be produced

37:50.080 --> 37:52.680
with this specific type of thinking.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.680
Yeah.

37:55.800 --> 38:01.680
Yeah, it's another kind of like cute.

38:04.480 --> 38:10.840
I say cute because it's another kind of cute approach to some of the kind of deep complex

38:10.840 --> 38:12.160
problems of the political.

38:14.440 --> 38:19.560
And I say cute because it's a kind of backing down of or a kind of historical accumulation

38:19.560 --> 38:21.920
of disappointments in authorities.

38:21.920 --> 38:28.480
So it feels a little bit like this child that who's who realizes that its parents are

38:29.480 --> 38:34.320
fallible, you know, and goes looking for something that isn't fallible.

38:34.320 --> 38:40.840
And so, you know, and the reason why I say that is because, like, OK, so, I don't know,

38:40.840 --> 38:46.200
to me, it does seem like, you know, it's trying to instead of instead of instead of trying

38:46.200 --> 38:52.840
to ponder what truths might be out there and try and work through that in all the kind

38:52.840 --> 38:57.280
of philosophical implications and all the social implications and through all the kind

38:57.280 --> 39:02.240
of historical pain and so on that has that has happened in this pursuit of truth.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.880
And here I'm talking about religion.

39:03.880 --> 39:07.640
I'm talking about political ideologies.

39:07.640 --> 39:13.920
I'm talking about geopolitics, you know, and and historical events.

39:15.240 --> 39:22.480
This is the kind of idea that, like, we don't need a universal truth coming stemming from

39:22.480 --> 39:23.840
kind of human reflection.

39:24.480 --> 39:29.800
All we need is something that ensures that who gets to determine the next round of truth

39:30.440 --> 39:38.640
is randomly selected in a way that can be deterministically analyzed as as decentralized,

39:38.640 --> 39:42.640
as fair. You know, there's no single node in the network that will be able to determine

39:42.640 --> 39:45.360
the truth over and over and over again.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.440
It's always going to be a different node in the network.

39:47.760 --> 39:53.000
So it's this kind of mathematically randomized set of truths.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.920
And there's some, you know, so when we talk about truth machine or this idea of

39:57.920 --> 40:02.840
blockchain as truth machine, that is the kind of truth that's being produced.

40:02.840 --> 40:08.080
It's it's it's, you know, and this is, again, a little bit of an abstraction because,

40:08.080 --> 40:11.000
like, OK, we're analyzing proof of work.

40:11.880 --> 40:15.880
And so the truth that we're talking about here is whether a transaction happened or

40:15.880 --> 40:19.840
not in the Bitcoin blockchain or whatever.

40:20.360 --> 40:24.120
And so it's a bit of an extrapolation to talk about kind of more existential or political

40:24.120 --> 40:29.840
truths. But I think I do think that extrapolation makes sense because that is the

40:29.840 --> 40:34.200
kind of ultimate political imaginary that's at play here in blockchain.

40:35.920 --> 40:42.200
But, yeah, it's it's a very particular it's a very particular kind of and strange and

40:42.200 --> 40:46.160
funky and quite interesting way of arriving at a set of truths.

40:46.160 --> 40:51.360
And I'm sure that that, you know, I do I am curious about, you know, the experiments in

40:51.360 --> 40:57.920
this space to see what and how we might be able to use something like this.

40:58.960 --> 41:04.720
But I'm also quite firm about finding the very specific appropriate uses of it and really

41:04.720 --> 41:11.880
not having this as some kind of overarching ideology, because, like you say, this form

41:11.880 --> 41:16.840
of consensus, this way, this method at which to arrive at consensus around truth is a very

41:16.840 --> 41:21.720
specific way. It's very different from, let's say, a group of people that get together in

41:21.720 --> 41:26.400
a room and share their experiences about something that then arrive at some kind of

41:26.400 --> 41:28.600
shared understanding of what has happened.

41:30.360 --> 41:35.400
That's a very, very different process and a very, very different way of being in the

41:35.400 --> 41:42.160
world and acting in the world and understanding the world than the proof of work consensus

41:42.160 --> 41:42.840
algorithm. Right.

41:43.560 --> 41:53.320
Actually, I'm keen on looking a bit closer on this subset of being incentive driven,

41:53.320 --> 41:55.120
because I think that's quite relevant.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.080
And you can see this in other fields as well.

41:58.080 --> 42:06.880
When, for example, a blockchain technology has to resolve the problem, how to bridge

42:06.880 --> 42:12.440
the gap into the material world, like the non-digital world, then things come into play

42:12.680 --> 42:14.080
like oracles and stuff.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.280
But these oracles, they are market driven.

42:17.280 --> 42:26.400
So it's a monetary incentive that is supposed to deliver the best possible truth, not the

42:26.400 --> 42:27.680
ultimate truth, maybe.

42:27.680 --> 42:40.200
But it's constructed as if this monetary incentive is able to produce the best workable

42:40.200 --> 42:45.240
truth. And I think this goes down to the bottom of the protocol when it comes to

42:45.240 --> 42:52.560
something like crypto economics, because there also you have this kind of techno

42:52.560 --> 42:59.000
engineering idea or behavioral engineering idea, you call it, I think, in the thesis as

42:59.000 --> 43:11.360
well, that you might be able to construct a good system architecture through actually

43:11.360 --> 43:19.600
carrots and sticks, which are, again, monetary incentives or the punishment of taking away

43:19.600 --> 43:20.920
some money.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.080
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

43:24.640 --> 43:31.000
And there, again, it's interesting to look at how things are done or might be done

43:31.000 --> 43:32.560
differently in a social scenario.

43:32.560 --> 43:38.440
Right. So, you know, we're working with crypto economic designs, then it is very much,

43:38.440 --> 43:43.560
like you say, kind of crude, carrot or stick kind of set of tools that are being used.

43:43.640 --> 43:48.280
Yeah, I think maybe for the listeners, could you briefly explain what it is?

43:48.280 --> 43:50.000
Crypto economics, what that means?

43:50.800 --> 43:54.120
Yeah, and it won't be brief, I'm sorry.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.600
Go ahead, go ahead.

43:55.680 --> 44:01.480
Because because I think, again, there's there's an interesting alternative history that

44:01.480 --> 44:04.800
hasn't really been discussed or written much about crypto economics.

44:06.600 --> 44:13.440
But crypto economics basically comes from, you know, in the Bitcoin protocol, what you

44:13.440 --> 44:21.600
have is a set of miners in the network that verify transactions, and those miners are

44:21.600 --> 44:29.120
rewarded with some Bitcoin every time they successfully manage to verify a block of

44:29.120 --> 44:34.320
transactions. And they're rewarded with a Bitcoin partially with the idea that if it

44:34.320 --> 44:42.280
pays more to contribute to the system than it does to attack it, then you'll have a

44:42.280 --> 44:48.680
system that essentially, yeah, it's a it's a kind of element of the security of the

44:48.680 --> 44:53.280
system, you'll have a system that runs that runs well.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.280
And so you've got you get even more kind of sophisticated versions of that, that, you

44:57.280 --> 45:01.720
know, you kind of economically reward good behavior in the network, and economically

45:01.720 --> 45:03.720
punish bad behavior in the network.

45:04.800 --> 45:10.520
And you see kind of different designs of that in different protocols in the blockchain

45:10.520 --> 45:13.000
space. And some of them get very elaborate.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.600
And I used a Bitcoin example because it's kind of one of the kind of more simple ones and

45:17.600 --> 45:18.600
easier to understand.

45:19.880 --> 45:25.560
So, yeah, it's a kind of combination of game theory and market dynamics in a kind of

45:25.560 --> 45:28.040
cryptographic decentralized network space.

45:29.360 --> 45:37.280
But the other story to that that I think is a very interesting angle is to understand this in

45:37.280 --> 45:43.880
terms of business models, because if we take, you know, the kind of business models of

45:45.920 --> 45:52.680
platform, the kind of like Internet platforms of today that use a kind of data extraction as

45:52.680 --> 46:00.320
their business models, data extraction and advertising, if we want to create new kind

46:00.360 --> 46:08.280
of a new type of Internet, you know, Web3, and if we want to create kind of new types of

46:08.280 --> 46:15.720
decentralized applications that make it cryptographically impossible for the kind of

46:15.720 --> 46:21.320
business models that rely on data extraction in that kind of a way, then we need a different

46:21.320 --> 46:24.200
kind of economy that runs these systems.

46:24.480 --> 46:28.360
And so for me, the interesting side of crypto economics, the really interesting side of

46:28.520 --> 46:34.000
crypto economics is the dream of and the idea of creating systems that are kind of

46:34.000 --> 46:40.280
economically autonomous and viable to run without the need for surveillance or

46:40.280 --> 46:44.040
surveillance capitalism or platform surveillance or, you know, the kinds of business

46:44.040 --> 46:45.920
models that we see run the Internet today.

46:45.920 --> 46:50.720
So that for me is like the kind of opportunity, the interesting possibility of crypto

46:50.720 --> 46:51.720
economics.

46:52.480 --> 46:57.240
Awesome. I think it's really, really important to point that out, because I mean, also for

46:57.240 --> 47:05.280
someone like me, it's kind of like overwhelming how the way crypto economics is

47:05.280 --> 47:13.360
handled is narrowed down to this idea of actually socio-technical engineering, which

47:13.360 --> 47:19.400
I think is really behavioral engineering, which I think is really actually a very

47:19.400 --> 47:26.640
dangerous road to to go on, you know, and it's very refreshing the way you did describe

47:26.760 --> 47:33.440
it right now that there are also, well, this might be a like acute danger to use the

47:33.440 --> 47:36.160
technology in the way of behavioral engineering or such.

47:37.040 --> 47:46.800
There are these other possibilities to actually use the technology in a way that is

47:46.800 --> 47:48.800
very much beneficial for everybody.

47:48.880 --> 47:55.400
Yeah. Yeah. But I think like in order for that to actually be able to happen, the space

47:55.400 --> 48:01.840
needs a lot of new thinking, especially from people that come from a heterodox economic

48:01.840 --> 48:07.880
thinking, because like right now what you've got is a bunch of programmers and computer

48:07.880 --> 48:10.360
engineers tinkering with economic tools.

48:10.760 --> 48:17.760
And so and from their perspective, they're trying to achieve certain security properties

48:17.760 --> 48:22.040
in the network. And so economics is being used in order to achieve those security

48:22.080 --> 48:25.080
properties. And that's why it tends towards behavioral engineering.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.840
That's why it tends towards like, how can we kind of make sure that certain types of

48:29.840 --> 48:37.480
behaviors, you know, honest behavior is happens, whereas kind of dishonest or malicious

48:37.480 --> 48:39.120
behavior is made impossible?

48:39.120 --> 48:42.800
You know, so that's like it's really the computer engineers perspective.

48:42.800 --> 48:48.440
But if we can have kind of more thinking in the space that looks more at this question of,

48:48.840 --> 48:53.040
you know, the business model of the Internet and the kinds of economics that might happen

48:53.040 --> 48:58.680
in that space, you know, if we can kind of start deliberately shaping that in some ways,

48:58.680 --> 49:01.200
I think that would be like super interesting.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.240
I think that's like, yeah, an important direction to work on.

49:04.800 --> 49:11.720
Very much so. But I have to say, I think it's in the in the current state, it's not just

49:11.760 --> 49:19.040
that the programmers are thinking in terms of security models, and that's why there's

49:19.040 --> 49:23.000
this kind of misunderstanding.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.480
But I'm afraid that I think what's happening right now, and you can see that in the

49:27.480 --> 49:33.280
collaboration between Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and Glenn Whale, an

49:33.280 --> 49:39.520
economist who wrote Radical Markets, what like the next level of shit in this sense

49:39.880 --> 49:45.120
is that they are very much aware of that.

49:45.120 --> 49:52.280
This is not just about security modeling, but they believe crypto economics to be the

49:52.280 --> 49:57.080
appropriate social technology to design society.

49:57.520 --> 49:59.280
That's that's the impression I get.

49:59.280 --> 50:07.200
And that and that for me means that there might be a lesson learned in terms of how

50:07.200 --> 50:14.400
autonomous systems are not fully controllable and that we should put some social input

50:14.400 --> 50:18.120
into how to govern things and stuff like that, to say just a bit simple.

50:18.560 --> 50:27.920
But that in the final step, there's still a belief in engineering society through

50:27.920 --> 50:32.520
appropriate technological architectures.

50:32.520 --> 50:39.040
Actually, they really call it, he calls it the new social technology, like crypto.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.720
Yeah. Yeah.

50:40.960 --> 50:48.840
And this is where I think it's important to understand power a little bit better and

50:48.840 --> 50:55.360
different forms of power, because in the blockchain space and I think in society in

50:55.360 --> 51:01.080
general, when people kind of think of power just off the top of their heads, what comes

51:01.120 --> 51:03.400
to mind is a kind of authoritarian dictator.

51:03.400 --> 51:09.400
Right. What comes to mind is like a kind of centralized, you know, some kind of centralized

51:09.400 --> 51:14.960
power where one person or one party or whatever determines everything and kind of power

51:14.960 --> 51:17.760
radiates from that kind of central point.

51:19.880 --> 51:24.400
But there's there's so many more theories of power and ways of understanding power that

51:24.400 --> 51:29.760
are much more kind of apt at describing our current kind of conditions.

51:30.720 --> 51:37.080
One of which, like in the case of what you just described, that is quite useful for

51:37.080 --> 51:45.920
understanding, for understanding this condition is like a kind of power that operates

51:45.920 --> 51:48.080
more on the landscape of what's possible.

51:48.080 --> 51:57.040
So instead of having a centralized person dictate what needs to happen, you kind of

51:57.040 --> 52:01.880
model the landscape in a way that makes certain types of things seem like they're just

52:01.880 --> 52:07.680
naturally impossible to do or very difficult to do and make other things feel like they're

52:07.680 --> 52:09.080
very desirable to do.

52:09.920 --> 52:14.120
And that's what a lot of kind of protocological design really is about.

52:14.120 --> 52:18.160
And that's what a lot of kind of crypto economic design really is about, is, you know,

52:18.160 --> 52:23.400
to kind of make certain types of behavior desirable for someone on a kind of intuitive

52:23.400 --> 52:26.960
level. So it doesn't feel like an authority is dictating anything to you.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.080
It's just the way the landscape looks.

52:29.080 --> 52:33.320
It's easier to go that, you know, down that road than it is to climb over that hedge.

52:33.320 --> 52:42.760
You know, and so, you know, I think keeping an eye on that is is is very important also

52:42.760 --> 52:49.680
to be able to analyze, you know, analyze what is the types of, you know, what is the

52:49.680 --> 52:53.560
politics that's being inscribed in the protocols that then shape that landscape, you know?

52:55.920 --> 53:00.240
Yeah. What's the main takeaway from your research?

53:01.960 --> 53:09.720
Oh, wow. The main takeaway.

53:09.720 --> 53:21.880
Give me one moment, because there's so many that we've touched on.

53:21.880 --> 53:23.480
What's the main takeaway for you?

53:23.480 --> 53:29.400
I think it's that we should all be aware that there is no wholesale answer to anything,

53:29.400 --> 53:37.640
actually, and that these things are, like, context specific and that they have, like,

53:37.720 --> 53:46.280
a side that might benefit us that is very much context specific, but another one that is not.

53:46.280 --> 53:50.280
And we shouldn't, like, alles über einen Kamm scheren.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.720
I don't know the English word for that.

53:51.720 --> 53:55.480
Like, we shouldn't approach it as if it's all the same.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.280
Take a second look. Maybe that's.

53:58.280 --> 54:01.400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right.

54:01.400 --> 54:03.800
I mean, really, that is the main takeaway.

54:03.800 --> 54:14.920
The main takeaway is, or the main work that I'm trying to do here is to, first of all,

54:14.920 --> 54:23.480
shift the understanding away from trying to arrive at some final solutions to problems

54:23.480 --> 54:31.880
of power and politics and these issues, and to create some ways to feel OK about the fact

54:31.880 --> 54:39.960
that we do live in an infinitely complex world and universe where the work is ongoing.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.360
And that's part of the excitement of things, right?

54:43.560 --> 54:46.040
These new technologies can do incredible things.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.320
History doesn't stop.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.440
The work doesn't stop.

54:50.440 --> 54:51.640
The game doesn't stop.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.760
The kind of interaction.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.320
I mean, there's so much more interesting things to come.

54:56.440 --> 54:59.800
And all this stuff will break and get old at some point,

55:00.680 --> 55:02.840
and we'll move on and something else will happen.

55:02.840 --> 55:06.920
And it's really kind of tracing through and sticking.

55:07.720 --> 55:12.120
There's just a fantastic title of a book by Donna Haraway that came out last year,

55:12.760 --> 55:14.120
Staying with the Trouble.

55:14.120 --> 55:15.000
That's what it's about.

55:18.760 --> 55:24.440
And I say this not as a kind of trying to create some kind of new universal statement,

55:24.440 --> 55:27.000
but more like literally staying with the trouble

55:27.960 --> 55:32.120
and understanding the details of how these technologies play out

55:32.120 --> 55:34.760
and getting involved in how they play out.

55:35.640 --> 55:36.520
Great final words.

55:37.080 --> 55:40.520
I usually put one question at the end,

55:41.160 --> 55:44.760
which is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

55:47.720 --> 55:52.120
If I think about the future, what makes it that the future is radically open.

55:52.600 --> 55:57.080
The future has never been more radically open than it feels right now.

55:57.080 --> 55:58.440
And that to me is incredible.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.360
Awesome.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.360
