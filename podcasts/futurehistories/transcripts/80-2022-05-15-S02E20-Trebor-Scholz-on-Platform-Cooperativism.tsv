102800	109120	Welcome Trevor. Hello thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Trevor let's start
109200	116000	with the definition. What is a platform cooperative? Right so there I guess this
116000	122640	is sort of a three-part question right so I mean you know like people need to
122640	128160	understand what cooperatives are in the first place so here this is I'm mostly
128160	133760	focusing on two types of cooperatives there are many more mostly interested in
134320	141680	worker cooperatives where the company is owned by the workers that all have an
141680	148480	equal say in the operation so it's based on the principle of one worker one vote
149600	157040	and so it's democratic ownership right and then the second type of cooperative
157040	161360	that I think is most relevant to the digital economy and a good example of a
161360	166960	platform cooperative is multi-stakeholder cooperatives so this means that there you
166960	175600	don't have this wall around a small number of members who all like benefit from this
176960	181440	this cooperative form right by having higher wages or by having
184240	189840	secure place to work and by having a voice in the workplace which is like really quite rare
192240	198640	when you think about it globally and when you think about how this idea of participatory
198640	205920	democracy has propagated like across countries right so who claim this concept right as as
206480	212320	something that is very central to their aspiration but in the workplace where most people spend like
212320	220560	most of their day that is like quite absent right and most workplaces so quite fascinating
220560	226560	so that's cooperative so with a focus on multi-stakeholder cooperatives and worker
226560	234400	corps multi-stakeholder cooperatives including also people from the community that are so not
234400	241760	just a small number of the members but it can also have classes within the cooperative that are
242320	248320	that are you know like in the community that are other you know other than the workers
248880	258000	you know so and that breaks with this idea that cooperatives can only benefit a small number of
258000	265360	members and there are you know tens of thousands of examples of that in italy with social
265360	274160	cooperatives and i mean really all over the world yeah so and so that's a cooperative then
274160	279120	a platform cooperative is really like a digital platform now we also think about you know web
279120	289920	three like with protocols and other technologies but a company for whom the digital operation is
290000	296640	central number one so it's not you know a cooperative with a website or so right so
296640	303040	like really where the that's at the heart of their operation as a business and they followed the
303840	310160	cooperative principles that were you know designed by the international cooperative alliance
310560	321200	so essentially those yeah two two characteristics and could you give us an example of a platform
321200	332560	cooperative maybe yeah absolutely so there's a you know wonderful project and in europe it's called
332640	341600	uh it's called smart which is in nine european countries and it's focused on freelancers and
341600	352240	it's makes this very interesting move of building on this sort of legal a legal hack you might call
352240	362720	it to transform freelancers so to speak into employees so that means basically they give
362720	371760	freelancers employee status by making them employees of the cooperative and thereby affording
371760	377360	them all the benefit under labor law that are significant in some countries not so significant
377360	383600	in others so it really depends but including things like unemployment right and
388080	394320	you know it's i mean labor law is in most countries designed mostly for employees and
394320	400000	not for freelancers so freelancers do are not protected right and this move to make them
400000	407600	employees essentially grants them that right so that's smart they're doing that specific to
407600	413600	each country like so in italy and spain and germany mostly in belgium that's where most
413600	421600	members are and also in france and they have 35 000 members they you know wrote over 100 000
421600	429200	contracts and have like a revenue of 200 million euros a year so quite a significant operation
429200	435600	they have co-working spaces for freelancers and so they are let's say an opera singer and
437280	446800	you get engaged by like an opera house or so you basically the the co-op the platform co-op
447360	455360	acts as your employer and the opera house essentially interacts with the co-op not with
455360	463760	the freelancer so the the money then goes to to smart and smart pays the freelancer a salary
463760	473040	so this has the advantage that often freelancers suffer from not being paid on time and the
474960	482080	in smart's case they pay seven days after the work is performed no matter if that
482720	490240	organization has paid or not so and as smart is quite significantly large
490240	495120	nobody really dares to not pay because they would be added to a blacklist right which then no
495120	501840	freelancer would work with them so it's it takes the anxiety out of freelancing too
502960	509760	interesting model and when you were talking about the definition of platform cooperatives
509760	516800	you mentioned multi-stakeholder cooperatives and you said that there are different you said classes
516800	523200	within the multi-stakeholder cooperative what is the kind of representation that these classes are
524000	531280	involved with because i mean this might be a form of ownership a part of ownership or it might be
531840	538400	something different like really taking part within the the the structures that form the
538480	542320	the given cooperative so are there different models of representation as well
543920	552720	yeah that's a good question so one platform co-op that is in the process of converting from a worker
552720	560480	from an italian worker co-op of tech workers to a multi-stakeholder platform co-op is fair bnb
561440	569920	which as the name suggests right offers short-term rental and 50 percent of the revenues
569920	577680	go to local communities so for projects that the community can decide on such as whatever you know
577680	583600	building a playground or you know whatever the community wants so that so that the
584400	590640	the money the revenue that is generated is not simply going to silicon valley right as it does
590640	599040	with the competitor but stays in that community so the way they are doing this is quite obvious
599040	606720	right so this is where the hosts of course would be a class right and and then potentially the
606720	612880	guests as well and then what you point to is a complicated question which is really not so easy
612880	619280	to answer because it really differs from from co-op to co-op so like how you know do they are
619280	627680	for example also non-voting classes right so that you have actually you know stakeholders that
628480	634480	you know they are let's say really involved with the company but they but they don't have voting
634480	642000	rights right that also exists so it's it's it's complicated as i can't really generalize on that
642000	646800	but it's it gives you the way to you know but everybody is still part of it right so in
647520	657040	like a wonderful example of this is also in the italian mountain ranges like in so many countries
658320	667360	in the rural areas right so there are many small towns that have a significant retention problem
667360	672560	right so people are leaving and were so it makes it very hard for the people that
672560	680560	stay that are left behind to still operate let's say the restaurant the cinema the hotel etc
681280	688320	and so they form cooperatives right they form one cooperative like a community cooperative
688320	695200	that does everything so the same person might work as part of this cooperative
696080	703520	in a restaurant in the afternoon or in the evening you know might be a shepherd in the morning
704560	712080	and maybe work in the post office at lunch or so you know so essentially and this is important
712080	721840	right cooperatives always emerged in moments of crisis right so they they emerge when like the
721840	732640	government or markets fail or even in the global south like support networks or families fail
733200	739840	then you have you know people turn to each other and and and found cooperatives in the
739840	746560	united states in the 1930s a significant part of rural america was not electrified
747120	755600	because the big utility companies didn't find it lucrative enough to electrify this last village
755600	762640	in montana right this just didn't pay right and so you know with the help of president roosevelt
762640	770640	at the time who wrote legislation making that easier people in those rural areas got together
770640	778800	and founded rural electric cooperatives and this is how over 40 of the electric grid in the united
778800	784800	states today is cooperative so essentially like there was a there was a problem and
785760	793040	the market right did wasn't interested to solve this problem and so people had to take it on
793040	798880	themselves and this is very important to understand because that is a very different framing than
799600	806160	creating a tech startup to dominate the world and you know extract from communities worldwide
806960	814880	and out-compete the competition and be like that let's say like one startup that dominates the
814880	820320	sector it's a totally different way of thinking right so it's that's not why they ever emerged
821040	830720	and one thing is to have one cooperative but what you are working on goes beyond that because
831680	838480	what you're involved in and what you kind of co-founded i guess is a form of movement so
838480	846400	platform cooperativism is a form of movement and i would be interested in what is the state of
846480	851040	things when it comes to platform cooperativism as a movement and specifically
851840	859040	going into the question of how do you succeed in networking the different cooperatives with each
859040	865760	other and therefore kind of creating some form of i don't know a better word but synergy effect or
865760	871360	something that goes beyond what one cooperative might be able to do and create something that
871360	877120	points towards maybe even an alternative form of political economy as such
879200	888640	yeah wonderful questions yeah so it's i think the big vision for this work is really
890320	897120	pluralist cooperative commonwealth and so i think what you point out is essential
897120	906080	because it's so we are working with over 500 businesses and there are many more that we are
906080	914080	aware of in two countries and so there are tens of thousands of people involved it's
914960	922880	truly global there are definitely challenges and which have to do with startup funding
922880	931040	right so like because the venture capitalist model banks on you know investing it's in
931040	937760	like for a venture capitalist to invest in 10 projects and seven of them failing two of them
937760	944160	succeeding moderately and one having this like windfall of money so profit which which will
944160	950480	just never be the case with cooperatives because that's just not that's just against the principles
951440	960480	and so just with like these other projects that i described earlier it's a community right that
960480	967920	sees that that having this business creating this business solves the problem that nobody else is
967920	976480	willing to solve for them right so like these social cooperatives in italy that i mentioned
976480	981520	earlier when i talked about multi-stakeholder cooperatives i think there are 11 000 of them
983760	992400	much of that emerged in after 2008 when italy significantly reduced its budget for social care
993440	1000000	so there are lots of cooperatives that emerge to help people with disabilities to have jobs elder
1000000	1010000	care etc so yeah so but to to come so so basically people see that there's a need
1010000	1016160	and they put their money together so it's crowd equity right so now there are also experiments
1016720	1024720	like in new york city where a lift competitor a taxi platform called drivers cooperative
1024720	1035440	has over 4 000 drivers and and they have taken a significant amount of investor funding
1036240	1041200	traditional investors who want to see profit but they did not give them controlling interest right
1041200	1047360	so they they can contribute but they will not control the business right and that's
1047360	1050320	that's what really matters with cooperatives right i mean you can take
1051280	1057600	uh this money maybe even from a municipality so i think there are there are thoughts in that
1057600	1063680	direction as well like why couldn't um i don't know the city of hamburg or
1064880	1073920	others be a class in one of those cooperatives now this is quite controversial for like you know
1073920	1079200	people with a sort of co-op dogma they would not agree to them but i think it's interesting as long
1079200	1083840	as there is no as long as there is no controlling interest i think it would be wonderful
1083840	1089200	when municipalities get involved right so we are working with municipalities because you ask of
1089200	1094000	the state of things um we're particularly interested in municipalities where this is
1094000	1100720	really supported right so obviously the regulatory framework is really important for for this to
1100720	1108320	thrive and uh it just happens that this is particularly the case and emilia romagna in
1108320	1117120	italy so the area around bologna which you know some people frame as co-op valley right so sort
1117120	1126320	of antidote to silicon valley and with platform corps like concerning a teacher but also fear bmb
1126320	1133680	and others but then also carola in the south of india which is a very progressive state which
1133760	1138960	has added platform corps to their government directive which means that we will help them
1138960	1144640	my organization will help them my institute will help them to to implement and some 4000
1144640	1152320	platform corps in the next five years that's their goal and then there's california and
1153280	1159920	also now there's work in bonas arias so like on argentina more broadly and then there's a lot
1159920	1166400	going on in brazil as well like so rio de janeiro sapaulo uh state the states of rio de janeiro
1166400	1174000	and sapaulo so um these are sort of the highlights right but it's you know also the netherlands and
1175360	1184240	and uh finland are of course also very open to this work states countries like kenya have uh
1184960	1190960	i think 48 percent of gdp in kenya is cooperative so it's significantly a cooperative culture
1192560	1198000	there is an organization like a sister organization of the platform corp consortium now also in
1199040	1208560	in berlin in germany and the platform corps uh germany uh it's called and um there's now also
1209120	1212880	you know there's a platform corps uh platform corp consortium in hong kong
1213520	1223680	there's uh just uh one starting now in indonesia in java and so it's sort of in many
1223680	1230480	many different places and i think right now i think people are really interested and i taught
1230560	1237360	a course on this just a few weeks ago uh on this overlap with web3 technologies
1238720	1248240	so how can dao's wide distributed autonomous organizations inform platform corps in terms
1248240	1254560	of their governance perhaps and i think many people in that space many technologists in that
1254560	1262320	space mistake what they are doing for cooperatives often not so clear on what a cooperative actually
1262320	1269680	is so but that sort of helps a little bit because people get more interested and open and also
1270240	1278880	thinking about how one could organize data cooperatively so how could you have cooperative
1278880	1289440	data trusts so this is essentially like a group of people creating a small pool of data and then
1289440	1297680	giving like fiduciary rights over those data through a bomb to the cooperative or some other
1297680	1304640	entity so these are all like experiments right like this is just starting but that's sort of the
1304640	1312560	state of things we we had some small successes let's say with policymakers so
1315280	1321520	andrea nales made when she was the leader of the social democrats
1323200	1330800	you know added platform corps to the you know part of the vision of the spd
1330800	1340240	uh but you know her candidacy wasn't her leadership wasn't exactly thriving wasn't
1340240	1347120	but it's uh but nevertheless you know she did that and so we tried to pick up on that the labor
1347120	1354240	party uh under corbin and also under the current leadership still has it as their vision for the
1354320	1365360	internet is one of their 10 guiding posts for that so so yeah so stuff going on in the policy level
1366240	1370800	we have an institute at the new school the institute for the cooperative digital economy
1370800	1375760	which has like a fellowship program so we are just about to announce our new cohort
1376400	1381760	which will essentially research exactly what i just talked about so like all of these little
1381760	1389280	points i had this is what they're all time and i guess one very interesting topic for further
1389280	1393360	research would be the question of governance because this is something i'm really interested
1393360	1400480	in because i mean it's pretty easy to imagine like smaller scale structures of cooperatives
1400480	1406480	where people are involved in the really involved in the governance of the given cooperative but
1406560	1412160	the more things get scaled up and the bigger the the organization gets the more difficult
1412160	1419360	it becomes to imagine a like meaningful um meaningfully taking part within the governance
1419360	1425520	structure and the self-governance of the whole thing so are there experiments with like large
1425520	1434240	scale self-governed um platform cooperatives and what are the takeaways of of these large-scale
1434240	1440560	platform cooperatives because i imagine you you run into very different problems once things get
1440560	1447840	bigger well that that um it's not just a question of for governance but it's also a question of
1447840	1454480	scaling right and so how do we think of scaling and it's really it's really um important to
1455360	1461200	detach yourself from the i guess silicon valley's thinking because it's co-op scale very differently
1461200	1470880	so they scale worldwide um through federations and alliances and collaborations so in a way that
1470880	1479440	is drastically different to anything uh coming out of silicon valley so the the traditional platform
1481440	1489440	as you may say has uh is an umbrella right an umbrella of many small cooperatives so
1489440	1493520	let's take for example and i gave that example in my chat talk when you if you want to
1494480	1501440	hear this a bit more in detail about this cleaning cooperative in new york and it's essentially three
1502080	1510320	very small worker co-ops and they sit under this umbrella of this second level cooperative the
1510320	1518160	platform co-op that's its own entity and each of the three groups uh has a representative to the
1518160	1525360	board of the platform co-op so and then this is how they all decide then how this platform
1525360	1532320	corpus operated which really functions more as a labor supply for them right so it allows them
1532320	1540000	access to jobs better jobs uh better gigs than they would have gotten than when they would have
1540080	1547920	pinned a flyer to a tree right so they reach more affluent clients that can pay them more
1547920	1553440	and then this is something we have mentioned yet you know allows them to make twice as much as
1553440	1560320	they used to make before so this is often the case with worker platform co-ops in that way they
1560960	1567600	in care and in cleaning right they make twice as much okay so how do they scale like well
1567600	1576240	like this sort of federal federation is is one model of scaling and it allows them to still
1576240	1583120	retain this interpersonal trust and um and friendships uh that are so important to
1583120	1592000	cooperatives so they are much more resilient than other business forms uh which is the research
1592000	1597280	show set after 2008 like there were far fewer cooperatives that went bankrupt than other
1597280	1601920	businesses and you know it's not that they have any magic sauce or anything it's just that they
1602480	1608320	you know they they suck it up right so they stick together and they want this business to succeed
1608320	1614480	because and you could say this a bit more pompously uh because they have a purpose right
1615360	1619840	i mean it's not it's not about business it's not about profit right it's about purpose
1620560	1630240	and um and so uh and that's also what you see with other groups and in in india for example
1630240	1639440	we work with the seva federation and uh that seva is a federation of cooperatives and a union
1639440	1648240	so the union is uh has over a million members and the co-op federation has over 300 000 members
1648320	1654560	and well that's another topic altogether like how those two uh bodies act right like
1655440	1664880	i would you need a union and it turns out to be a very good idea but um the the point here is that
1665440	1676960	this is also over 105 cooperatives in this federation of several several men so and together
1676960	1683520	they for example with covid right like coordinated their help efforts to you know provide
1684240	1691920	workers with money and food and you know medical supplies like masks etc sanitizer hand sanitizer
1692640	1701200	so um that really makes sense and another huge cooperative federation in india is amul which is
1702080	1708960	i think the largest milk producer in the world and it's 1.7 million milk producers
1708960	1716400	small milk producers all networked in this federation and so so i mean i can talk a lot
1716400	1722560	about that there's lots of examples in italy as well that illustrate this well where essentially
1723360	1728640	like most italian businesses are very small but then they federate to be able to compete with
1728640	1738480	larger companies but with the web3 right you have like another thing coming and i'm not sure i would
1738480	1743760	call those cooperatives but they they are i think it's an interesting thing to explore and they
1743760	1749840	could work in that direction where through blockchain you can split ownership across
1750720	1755200	i don't know hundreds of thousands of people right so uh i don't know if you followed this
1755200	1761760	at all in the united states there was an attempt to buy the constitution so i think there are i
1761760	1769920	don't know how many copies probably a dozen or so which were printed uh you know initially
1770880	1780480	and uh they i think it was 40 million dollars for one copy and uh this online group that tried to
1780480	1787680	purchase it they raised 19 million which you know is not 40 million but they raised 19 million
1787680	1794000	dollars right i mean that is incredible and uh so then they set their next targets on buying a soccer
1794000	1804960	team uh jointly and then uh a vacation resort like a spa in florida uh that they wanted to jointly
1804960	1809520	buy so i think nobody really knows it's just i think it has something to do that you can
1809520	1815600	you can do that with blockchain right um what that would look like and i think it's completely
1815600	1821680	unresolved how how people would then vote that's it let's say they managed to buy this result that
1821680	1828720	now what right i mean so how do they run it um that would be a huge experiment but i think to
1828720	1833920	to split i think the huge the really interesting question is like it's the research is really
1833920	1840640	clear that like worker corps and to an extent multi-stakeholder corps are better businesses
1840640	1846480	for people right i mean that's so you know like it's you know more sustainable it's better for
1846480	1853680	the planet it's uh they are they're better jobs there's dignity in the workplace uh you know
1853680	1863520	people are treated as human beings but it's it's it's not um you know obviously as large
1863520	1871440	as corporations and so well this this would be an interesting way to scale as well right through
1872640	1880880	this type of like ownership fractals if you want you know uh but like i said there isn't really
1880880	1886400	an example yet of where that is actually happening but it's very promising interesting
1888080	1893440	yeah well i understand the interest the initial interest i'm highly skeptical i have to say because
1893440	1900000	i mean it's it it still very much stays within a very particular paradigm of private ownership and
1900000	1909920	then uh is able more or less to spread uh this over a given asset so to speak but well let's
1909920	1918480	let's say um it's always interesting to see experimentation i guess um so you mentioned
1919120	1925920	that platform cooperatives are the better businesses um because they are very much
1925920	1935200	oriented towards a humane setting within one works and gets paid and has social interactions
1935200	1940960	and so forth and so on so what i think is really great about platform cooperatives is that they
1940960	1948400	offer a very concrete alternative in the here and now and um that they also by doing that represent
1948400	1956880	some form of let's say building block for how transformations to post-capitalist futures might
1956880	1963760	actually look like so i really really love that but at the same time it's important to ask and
1963760	1971040	also to be aware of what exactly they they are able to do for what kind of things they might be
1971040	1977680	a solution and for what they might not be a solution so what are the what the what the
1977680	1983680	boundaries of of this concept are i heard an interview with you in in which you said that you
1983680	1990800	are often asked whether platform cooperativism is an alternative to uber google facebook etc
1990800	1994960	and in at least in this interview you you replied that this is the wrong question
1995680	2001280	and so i would like to to frame it a little differently and the question would then be if
2001280	2008720	you consider platform cooperatives as a solution for certain kinds of social problems um for
2009760	2018400	which problems might they be a solution and for which problems maybe not right i mean if you want
2018400	2027360	to run a platform or start a platform and you have an interest in a social justice lens
2028080	2034640	or if that is your mission if you're interested in social justice right then i think there isn't
2034640	2042880	a question that that's really the model to go with right but you know obviously like that is
2042880	2050640	really not the objective of most businesses so but if that is your objectives then i think
2052000	2058240	that would be the form to pick i agree with you i don't think it's the answer to everything at
2058240	2066240	all i mean it's not a panacea it's not a silver bullet or anything but it is very suitable to
2067200	2074640	uh like picking up on the historical narrative of what they have responded to in the past
2074640	2082320	so when you think about like one of the fastest growing uh largest areas of the economy that
2082320	2090560	is really failing that is care right elder care so uh you have we have in all countries all over
2090560	2101040	the world and like a explosive growth of people over 80 80 and older and uh there's a significant
2101040	2108880	i mean millions of workers missing to fill those spots to care for them and uh that is also true
2108880	2117360	in germany and uh yeah it's also i think hundreds of thousands of workers missing in that industry
2117360	2128560	and the reason is that it's a low prestige and terribly paid job right and so with platform
2128560	2133520	cooperatives organizing this cooperatively and we see some examples of this actually
2134240	2143920	in in california in los angeles where platform co-op started by a union by the way has
2144400	2149680	um started to work with two hospitals and they have been doing this for a very long time they
2149680	2157680	had a pilot in 2016 or so like with 10 nurses and now they are working on scaling this up to
2157680	2165200	2000 and then the hope is within two years to 10 000 nurses and to essentially offer
2166160	2175680	uh care work flexibly through an app while paying the nurses
2177440	2179440	better than they would have been paid otherwise
2182240	2187680	so so i think it's a care and care sector is one example where i think this is very much
2188000	2194960	uh predestined to work very well and then also we see i mean you know it seems sort of
2195600	2202800	counter-intuitive but i mean this model in new york is working right with this competitor to
2202800	2208880	lift not so much to uber right so this is also interesting it's not so much in terms of scale
2208880	2213120	also i mean it's tertiary right so it's like the third biggest player in new york
2213840	2223760	um and has a chance at that you know um but otherwise definitely in uh for food course
2223760	2230800	so we see that in berlin and i think also Vienna but all over the world i mean there were i think
2231440	2238800	eight or so of those founded in Barcelona in the last year alone so um they uh you know they're
2238880	2243200	really emerging quickly not that they all stay around right this was specific to the pandemic
2243200	2250800	but uh but there is a large uh federation already it's called co-op cycle uh coming out of paris
2250800	2259200	which uh has more than 60 uh uh cooperatives under its wing of couriers and provides them
2259200	2266320	with digital infrastructure right so they offer them the software and in return they
2266960	2271440	uh all abide to certain principles for example they are not allowed to use motorcycles
2272000	2281440	it has to be bicycled for ecological reasons so um that's where i where you see this can really
2281440	2286240	work but we see it emerging in all kinds of sectors so it's very hard to say actually because
2286240	2293920	you know we see it with this my cool classroom which has language teachers organizing through
2293920	2298960	platform cooperatives which is essentially language teachers all over the world
2300240	2307360	and being members of that we see it for designers we see it for photographers with stuxy
2309280	2310080	we are seeing it
2312480	2317840	in many different sectors but i think a chaos care and
2317840	2326080	and transport transportation i think probably uh will be the most likely ones to succeed
2326800	2333200	yeah yeah and you know in some countries for example like in brazil um the one of the largest
2333200	2338960	domains of the cooperative movement in brazil is actually hospitals and doctors and nurses
2338960	2346560	and so i think this is really where that is together as well and what do we have to do if
2346640	2353520	we want to use this principle this this this type of social organization so to speak platform
2353520	2362720	cooperatives as something that that is the nucleus for going beyond itself because there is of course
2362720	2372320	an inherent danger in in the in the way that it might also by being the go-to place in crisis
2373040	2379280	kind of letting the state like from the hook which would be a problem as well because i mean
2379280	2387680	this is an obvious danger so i would say we need to like work in tandem with other movements with
2387680	2395680	other like ideas for alternative ways of doing economy doing social organization and all of that
2395760	2402560	in order to to make platform cooperativism something that like really
2403280	2410480	is a building block of a post-capitalist future maybe no i absolutely agree so i mean again like
2410480	2419520	another really great question um the uh yeah i mean i think it's essential to work with other
2419520	2426400	movements and political movements so i think you know unions are a great place to start
2427200	2433040	and just to just in passing to mention like why that matters i mean for many reasons
2434320	2438000	very interesting to look at that in the indian example but just to stay in new york where
2438800	2445680	you know like when they started when eric foreman and his colleagues started drivers
2445680	2451520	cooperative like one of the the main problems for a startup like that is that they don't have
2451520	2458080	marketing funds right so you can run because so much is dependent on supply right like you also
2458080	2464560	need drivers right that are available so if you aren't known right if people don't haven't heard
2464560	2472080	about you that's a real problem so this is where the vc backed companies spend you know millions
2472080	2480000	of dollars so they didn't have that money so but by working with the union which has contacts to
2480000	2487600	hundreds of thousands of people right so they were able to reach out to lots of new yorkers that to
2488400	2494240	tell them about this and well it helped when the new york times picked up on it as well so
2494400	2505120	um uh that's uh i guess one one answer to that question and if you think about like models of
2505120	2514720	political economy that go beyond this notion of platform cooperativism what are the frameworks
2514720	2521680	that you that you think about because i mean they are i recently uh read a bit more about paracon
2521680	2525920	participatory econ economics i will do an interview with robert and now tomorrow by the
2525920	2532240	way and and they when they describe the processes of transformation they very much point towards
2532240	2538960	cooperatives as a necessary and very much uh important fruitful building block of this
2539760	2544000	like of course long-lasting phase of transformation of transition into
2544640	2549840	other types of political economy so we already established that cooperatives
2550800	2555840	essentially have to be an important element of that but how do you what do you think about if
2555840	2564720	you think beyond that like because at some point cooperatives will have like over lift themselves
2564720	2570320	no i completely agree with that comment as well but i wanted to say just let's go for a second
2570320	2575120	back to the your previous question because i think there's more to be said about this so james
2575200	2582480	mahoon has just published this book platform socialism where he picks up exactly at this point
2583520	2592640	i think a very interesting and fruitful book but i think very much from a european perspective
2594640	2602240	where the i mean what we saw basically in the united states and in poland and in hungary and
2602240	2609520	in so many other countries is that people just realize that the i mean there's the reason that
2609520	2617840	they lost trust in government right and that is in the united states when you imagine a worker
2617840	2628240	having entered the labor market in 1978 perhaps all these promises right in 50 years nothing has
2628240	2634640	changed for that worker right except that productivity increased significantly
2634640	2642400	and wages stagnated since 1978 right so like if adjusted for inflation so
2643680	2650480	i mean how can you blame anyone that they would be disengaged from fed from federal government
2650480	2657680	right so now now i would not i mean it's just it's just a fact do i like that of course not
2657680	2663280	right and do i think is that participatory democracy is a project that nobody should ever
2663280	2669920	give up on and and electoral politics of course of course not right but then there's also the
2669920	2680160	reality that those systems are just deeply broken right so you see this even with the current
2680160	2686080	presidency to an extent right and so this is i think where municipalities become much more important
2686080	2692640	right and because on that level you can it's limited what you can do which we saw in the case
2692640	2700880	of barcelona but you can do something and and and can actually really support a model like that to
2700880	2709600	an extent and and make changes to an extent right so so i want to be really careful about this
2709600	2714320	because i think i agree with you completely and i don't want to say i fully want to support what
2714320	2719440	you said about you know like not letting the government off the hook but they also have to
2719440	2725440	acknowledge that not every country is germany right and like when i look at the united states
2725440	2735440	i mean it's a deeply flawed system right to be polite and very very dysfunctional and
2736800	2741120	and that's not theoretical so you can say like well but you know we should we should
2741120	2746640	hope for this to change you know but then look at the real lives of people this is real people
2746640	2751840	living real lives every day and they are getting all these promises you know from politicians
2752400	2759200	and they just don't come through it's not felt in their lives and i think this has to change right
2759760	2769280	and uh and they there's i think a significant feeling of a lack of voice right that you don't
2769280	2777120	have a voice in society which also cooperatives are in response to because when you think about
2777120	2782720	in the united states incarcerated people are returning from prison so you know returning
2782720	2790320	citizens entering the workplace so they are excluded from federal elections right i don't
2790320	2793440	know if you know this so like when you come out of prison in the u.s you cannot vote anymore
2794080	2800640	and uh so well those are the only workplaces where they you know actually have a real voice
2800640	2810480	like they are equal members and have a voice and i think that is um i mean i think ultimately it's
2810480	2820400	about uh social democracy i think that's a social democracy where people really have a felt
2820400	2824560	relationship to what's happening in the government really changing their lives
2825520	2831840	and the government that also really represents the types of people that actually constitute the
2831840	2840000	population right so that kind of uh stakeholder society right like where people really feel
2841120	2847360	part of that uh well i had talked about the vision before you had asked before and i appointed to
2848080	2857920	a vision of a sort of pluralistic uh commonwealth right so where cooperatives are part of a global
2857920	2869120	network of businesses that can also change the sort of north south dynamic right this gap
2869920	2874640	because which of course is a criticism of cooperatives today which is like even the
2874640	2881600	largest cooperatives like mondragon are dependent on supply chains that are just as deeply
2881600	2890400	exploitative as um as anyone else and if there would also be cooperatives in the global south
2890400	2896720	that then produce for cooperatives in the global north right and you would establish this um this
2896720	2903280	commonwealth you could change that you could even extend that vision to what some people have called
2903280	2909760	like data colonialism right and to to push back against how which which i think affects people in
2909760	2914960	the global south much more than people in the global north uh because the data collection is
2914960	2921760	much more ruthless um to actually put people in the global south in charge of their own data
2921760	2927520	through data trusts or things we had mentioned earlier and maybe push back on that in this way
2927520	2935360	as well so i think that's a vision yeah i mean i'm i think paracorn is a great approach
2936400	2942720	as well there are many right of the sort of post-work society and many others
2943840	2952400	which i support but you know i think they are often so far away that and this is very important
2952400	2957680	you know i'm not at all taking away from that but i think what's there is a lot of that you
2957680	2965200	know there's a lot of these long-term visions uh what is there's very very few of uh these sort
2965200	2972880	of next steps right and i think uh like a lot of academics like really discourage this right they
2972880	2978800	say like wow this is just too pragmatic and you get stuck in this sort of presentism or whatever
2978800	2985440	you want to call it and i really disagree with that and i think it's it's uh deeply disrespectful
2985440	2993440	of the lives of people now of the workers now that are living in these super precarious situations
2993440	2999600	so i think to build something as you said a nucleus of like a scaffolding right a scaffolding on
2999600	3006640	which you can then erect uh like a post-capitalist vision or let's say like a social democracy just
3006640	3016720	on the way to that is is deeply valuable and and something i really support
3018160	3023840	and there's one question i ask all of my guests at the end and this is if you think about the
3023840	3034400	future what makes you joyful well i mean maybe i can talk to you about a class i taught which
3034400	3047840	sounds um may be expected but um in 2020 in february uh mondragon the largest workup
3047840	3050880	worker corp in the world right so they came to visit me at the university
3051680	3057440	and shortly thereafter the pandemic started and we immediately uh you know we signed a paper to
3057440	3064640	collaborate and um and we started a class an online class on platform co-ops like an emergency
3064640	3074960	response and we taught over 1200 students from 57 countries and uh and managed because there was
3074960	3084000	a sense of urgency to engage uh over 50 organizing over 60 organizations actually in those countries
3084000	3090560	so they supported the course locally helping people with their local knowledge about the laws
3090560	3100640	and language etc to start those those uh projects and we had weekly meetings uh everybody in their
3100640	3108240	lockdown and in a time which was really rather dark and possibly depressing uh and for me this
3108240	3115840	was just i mean it was an incredible experience because you saw all these people you know like
3115840	3123200	from i don't know transgender entrepreneurs in malaysia connecting with like african-american
3123200	3132640	entrepreneurs in selma alabama i mean like who i mean just to see these like in front of you like
3132640	3140480	all these people all over the world right having this wonderful spirit and all dedicating themselves
3140480	3147840	to changing their world uh i mean i guess if anything could give you hope i mean that was
3147840	3159120	definitely a moment um to and it really uh sowed the seeds for further work right because now these
3159120	3167760	organizations uh learned about platform co-ops and they are now incubating them right also after
3167760	3174160	a couple classes over and uh and we still hear from projects coming out of that
3175120	3179360	um and so on so it's a very it's a very beautiful experience
3180720	3187280	great trevor thank you so much for taking the time and being part of future histories thanks
