0	1960	Welcome to Future Histories.
1960	6780	My name is Jan Gross, and my guest today is Richard Barbrook, who is, amongst
6820	12320	other things, known for coining the term Californian ideology as an early critique
12320	14720	of Silicon Valley techno-determinism.
15240	20300	He and Andy Cameron wrote their influential essay on the subject in 1995,
20340	22780	and the topic is as prevalent as ever.
23400	26620	I met Richard at the 10-year anniversary of the techno-politics
26620	28300	research group here in Vienna.
28700	30660	So shout outs to them as well.
31140	35820	Another person whom I was happy to meet again there is Jaya Clara Brecke,
35820	41100	my guest in episode six, which was, up until now, the one episode in this
41100	42760	podcast that I did in English.
43240	48400	So if you're not fluent in German, but indeed love future histories, then please
48400	51100	go and check out episode six with Jaya.
52020	56300	And whatever language you actually speak, if you like the show, then please
56340	62060	tell a friend, or if you can, then support it on Patreon via patreon.com
62060	63620	slash future histories.
63980	67220	Marianne and Paula recently did just that.
67260	73020	And I want to send my warmest thanks to them for doing so, but now please
73020	76340	enjoy today's episode with Richard Barbrook.
81980	84940	Richard, you have done so many different things.
84940	87540	I think it's easier if you introduce yourself.
88180	93060	Well, I teach politics at the University of Westminster in London, and I'm a
93060	99380	founder member of Class War Games, and we also run a cooperative called
99380	101460	Digital Liberties that makes games.
102060	109180	And I was sitting outside a cafe in Vienna and someone came up to talk to me,
109260	110740	who I thought might be begging for money.
110740	113740	But then I realized he actually did, because I'd never met the guy before.
113940	117180	And he said, you are the person who wrote the Californian ideology.
117620	118820	And I said, yep, that is true.
119340	121620	So that's the other thing I'm well known for.
121900	128100	That was in 1995, where we critiqued.com neoliberalism before its time.
129380	136700	And hopefully starting a process that will eventually lead into
136700	138380	different kinds of futures.
138740	139460	Ah, yes.
139500	143420	Well, it's one of the reasons I got interested in futures, like writing
143420	144380	histories of the future.
144380	148660	I wrote a book called Imaginary Futures, which is the start of the first chapter
148660	150780	that says the future is what it used to be.
151500	156900	So things like, you know, predictions of artificial intelligence or, you
156900	160420	know, fusion power or space tourism.
160460	165020	They've been around since at least the 1960s, and they come back with a
165020	167220	regularity, which is quite extraordinary.
167500	171060	And of course, the information society, we're always about to transition from
171540	175700	industrial capitalism to some sort of digital utopia.
176180	180020	And again, that goes back to at least the 1960s, or in its Russian
180020	182100	original version, the 1950s.
182900	187500	One point you're making is actually that there is this repetition of futures
187500	193020	actually, and you pledge us to invent new imaginaries of futures.
193020	196780	So why do we need these new imaginaries of future?
196980	200620	Well, I think the reason is because, I mean, I've just been to visit the
200620	205300	Red Vienna Exhibition, which everybody should go and see next to the Rathaus.
206380	207340	And that's an interest.
207340	210340	That's interesting because they had a very clear vision of the future.
211780	216620	So people in Vienna before the First World War had terrible housing and bad
216620	218980	health care and really poor education.
219380	223700	And so to raise the mass of the population up, they had a vision of a sort of social
223700	226940	democratic transition to communism.
227580	231620	And what you need to do is have a healthy, educated and well-housed proletariat.
231660	232820	And then they went and did it.
233460	235460	And it's quite extraordinary achievement.
236540	239460	And present day Vienna still benefits from that attempt.
239860	245940	And that's that's an example of if the left needs a way of thinking about a future,
246300	250780	because if you know, when you start doing things now, they're like a beta version of
250780	253660	what's going to come up, come eventually.
253700	258340	And so if you don't have that idea of an imaginary future, you're in a bit of a
258340	260980	problem because the right does have an imaginary future.
260980	265580	It has a sort of neoliberal dystopian, but in Britain, it's called Brexit.
267620	272940	You know, so you turn yourself into a sort of fantasy version of America, basically.
273020	275980	Or even worse, a native nationalism.
276620	278620	Well, that is partly America, yes, of course.
279340	280100	I can live there.
281100	285220	No, no, I went to school in America where they used to make them all pledge allegiance
285220	288940	to the flag every morning, which is a little English person I thought was very weird.
290260	295100	So, you know, they have to inculcate a nation, a multinational country and
295220	297940	homogenize them into one thing called Americans.
298940	305100	So how could these like really radically different imaginaries, imaginary futures
305260	310860	look like? Because, I mean, there's social democracy, but we kind of had that.
310860	316020	And it's at the end, I mean, at least in the way it has been done, like the
316020	324620	last 40, 50 years, it has always been a, like a compromise between a social
324620	327060	welfare state and a capital market.
328820	333620	I met an English guy who was living here on the, in the exhibition, who was
333620	337580	lecturing me about the awfulness of British politics because you don't want
337580	342140	to compromise, and I was saying, well, you can't compromise, that's the problem.
342820	348140	Yeah, you've had that advantage that the, I was told by an Austrian of the post
348140	351900	war generation who said the socialists and the Christian Democrats learned to
351900	354540	compromise in the concentration camp.
356380	360860	So, yeah, you've had that built into the system because of the trauma of the
360860	365620	civil war and the Nazi occupation and all the rest of it, and the second war,
365700	369540	and that you, which you lost, it went badly.
369980	375620	But the, but the, the imaginaries that you are calling for, they are aiming for
375620	378020	something different, for something more, actually.
378020	378540	Exactly.
378580	379340	What does it look like?
379340	384900	I mean, if you went to Britain today and showed them red Vienna, that would look
384900	390020	like an imaginary future, you know, 60% social housing, really good welfare
390020	394820	services, you know, okay, it's a very paternalistic vision of social
394820	399980	democracy, but nonetheless, compared to lots of places in England today, and
399980	402660	especially in America, it would seem even more utopian.
403900	408980	So that, that sort of vision I agree with, he does seem data, though, of course, if
408980	413260	you're Chinese, it seems like the future, of course, they are building social
413260	418500	housing on a massive scale and all this sort of stuff and adding digital
418580	419540	technology to it.
420340	424980	And they do think that they're going to build communism in 30 or 40 years.
425420	430260	As I, oh, yes, I met somebody from a party school in Beijing, who confidently
430260	432740	predicted that they would be there in 50 years.
433460	437260	And I said, if I come back in 20 years time, it'll still be 50 years away,
437260	437700	won't it?
438940	440660	To me, it doesn't look that way.
440660	447100	I mean, they are actually more going to a, like engineered capitalism, no?
447100	450420	Confucian socialism, as Daniel Bell's son calls it.
450460	451140	Oh, right.
451140	451820	That's the term.
451820	452260	I see.
452300	455020	Well, it's got a sort of, you know, particularly they've had a long tradition
455020	458900	for a thousand, well, I think Confucius is two and a half thousand years ago.
459300	464580	This vision that you have an enlightened elite who look after the people.
466060	468380	So, but it's really comes from the Han dynasty, doesn't it?
468380	472260	It's like 1000, 500 years ago, whatever.
472940	473180	Sorry.
473740	476700	What's the, the future that you are imagining?
477420	480620	I think it's, I think we should, I said, I think we should think the
480620	485140	Pali is a reassertion though of the old socialist future.
485420	487140	I think that is an important part of it.
487140	491820	It's interesting that one of the things that I found with continentals and they
491820	495700	think what's happened in the Labour Party recently is they find quite the strange
495700	498220	is this reassertion of socialist iconography.
498860	503180	So if you think of something like Podemos in Spain, they got rid of the red flag
503340	506020	and the international and all this sort of stuff.
506500	511340	Whereas in England, that scene is quite important to reassert that continuity
511340	514900	with working class history, you know, back to, I mean, obviously England's
514900	518140	had a long tradition, long history of working class struggle back to
518140	519220	the early 19th century.
519540	523260	So, you know, an interesting thing is, so one of the things are, which would be
523260	528180	seen as an imaginary future or a vision of the future is the Labour Party had a
528180	534220	conference about 18 months ago called alternative models of ownership where
535060	541500	you know, obviously the neo, the neoliberal model has failed, privatisation,
541500	542740	deregulation.
543340	546220	And so how do you replace that?
546340	551700	One thing is that go back to the old state capitalist nationalised industries.
552300	554380	That seems not a good idea.
555100	558860	So the alternative models of ownership is to look at things like municipal
558860	563300	ownership, obviously what a lot of red Vienna would be quite inspiring, but also
563300	567620	particularly cooperatives, you know, cooperatives were developed in mid 19th
567620	573860	century England, consumer co-ops, housing cooperatives and producer cooperatives.
573860	578740	And so if you look at places like Preston, which is the city in the north of
578740	586500	England, the local council has actually started to develop local cooperative
586500	591140	economy, partly to keep money, money, you know, when they private, previous
591140	595300	councils privatised services, money was being taken out of the local economy by
595300	598220	the privatised providers of services.
598500	602900	If you hand them over to cooperatives, the money tends to stay within the local
602900	606980	institutions. And this is now seen as a model for creating a new type of
606980	612940	socialism that's based on not just replacing private managers with state
612940	616260	managers, but actually to democratise the economy.
616740	621900	And this comes back to a lot of thought that was done, a critiques actually of
621900	628620	the old type state system that, you know, that they trusted managers and people who
628620	633300	were, you know, basically white collar, this was a paternalistic, this would be
633300	636820	the downside of the red Vienna model, this very paternalistic view.
637060	642060	But if you've got an educated workforce, they ought to be able to run the system
642100	646740	themselves. You know, who knows how best to run a railway, John McDonnell, who's
646740	650380	the finance spokesman of the Labour Party.
650700	654620	And he would say, well, who knows how best to run a railway, not the managers, it's
654620	659140	the people who drive the trains, maintain the tracks, look after the stations.
659140	660380	They know how to run the railway.
660380	664420	So what you have to do is get what they often call their tacit knowledge about the
664420	667860	system and get an input that into running things.
668140	672060	And I think that's an interesting vision, because actually that is a new modern
672060	676180	vision, particularly if you couple it with digital technologies, you know, using a
676180	681620	lot of the stuff that we do in everyday life with social media and polling and all
681620	685580	the other stuff that you can do and allow people to pass, you know, not just to turn
685580	690060	up to meetings, but to contribute knowledge in other ways and to be consulted.
690300	693180	But actually, also, it's going back to the middle of the 19th century.
693180	697380	This is what English socialism was about, actually, before the First World War.
698060	704140	So if you read Karl Marx, who's the German theorist of English socialism in
704140	707180	volume three of Capital, he said, what's the what's the future?
707180	709100	It's actually not the state ownership of everything.
709100	710820	It's the cooperative ownership of everything.
711060	712620	He's quite explicit about that.
712820	714460	And that comes from that experience.
714460	718700	So that's a good example where, in a sense, you have to look back at old
718700	723100	versions of the future and then think about how they can be redesigned and
723100	726900	inspire us to think about how do we create a new version?
726900	731900	Because obviously, the problems we're facing are some ways the same, you know,
731900	736420	capitalist alienation and exploitation, in some senses, have intensified.
736420	738540	But on the other hand, they're very different because we have a very
738540	745180	different workforce, for instance, much more ethnically diverse gender.
745500	748540	All these other issues have to go into it.
748540	751220	And I think crucially, it's much, much better educated.
751460	755780	So if you have a better educated workforce, more skilled, it's going to
755780	761220	think about how it wants to run its own life in a very different way than
761220	765700	people who are desperate, who are very happy if people provide them with
765700	770620	housing and education and healthcare and all the rest of it, particularly if
770620	772740	it's done by a very enlightened leadership.
772940	777220	Now, I think people feel that they want to say in all this, in a real say as well,
777220	780700	not just ticking boxes.
781700	789140	So that means the transition would actually start in the here and now by
789180	794740	establishing work-owned cooperatives that serve as practical examples for
794740	797900	this kind of economic structure.
798300	804180	But there would still be a market mechanism that is in place in between
804180	805340	the different cooperatives.
805340	809940	Is that just a transitional phase or is it also, what about markets?
810260	816100	Are they a part of the structure that you are aiming for?
816100	823500	Is it like market socialism or will there be a transition that, for example,
823500	827660	involves abolishing money and the commodity?
829140	835060	Abolishing the commodity labor power, the ultimate appeal.
835060	840820	We used to read this book by a guy called Jan Appel called Communist
840820	844740	Production and Distribution, which I finally managed to get a copy of at the
844740	846540	Anarchist Book Fair a few years ago.
847100	851620	And that's quite interesting re-looking at that because he was a Dutch council
851620	858180	communist, so he was writing, must have been in the late 20s, early 1930s.
858540	859700	And it's how do you do that?
859860	860500	It's really interesting.
860500	861420	How would you do that?
861940	867420	If you actually wanted to get rid of money, and it's always been this conundrum.
867420	871980	I mean, Robert Owen, who's the founder of English socialism, thought you could just
871980	874900	replace gold pieces with labor notes.
874900	878580	You know, you do one hour of this and one hour of that and you just swap the note.
879100	883740	But as Marks points out in the introduction to Gundersen, what happens is
883740	888700	that the labor note slowly turns into money and becomes the regulator and
888700	890060	commodifies the labor.
890500	893100	Yeah, and so that he has this really interesting problem.
893100	898580	And you think now, of course, with digital technologies, a lot of this sort of state
898580	902020	planning, which went massively out of fashion after the collapse of the Soviet
902020	904900	Union, suddenly it seems a lot more rational.
905260	910380	You know, I wrote about the invention of the internet in America, where they
910380	915820	pumped huge amounts of money in the 1960s to invent this very esoteric computer
915820	919060	network because they were terrified that the Soviet Union was doing it.
919060	922300	And one of the reasons the Soviet Union wants it is because they had the idea
922300	926620	that they could replace the state plan with a giant mainframe that would
926620	931380	instantly, you know, you go into a shop and buy red socks and it would send back
931380	934940	a message to the sock factory saying, produce more socks in this size than the
934940	935660	color red.
936100	940260	And of course, this seemed incredibly utopian then, but now any pre-supermarket
940260	941340	does it with barcodes.
941980	946100	And it's a debate that is being revived, actually.
946140	951140	I mean, there's this book, The People's Republic of Walmart by Leith Phillips and
951140	954340	Mark Michael Roswowski.
954380	957940	Well, it also goes back to the people that there's been a really renewed interest
957980	963140	in what happened in Chile with Stafford Beer and Cybersyn, I've met Raul Espejo.
963740	967500	There's this very brilliant, brilliant book by Eden Medina, which is called
967500	971380	Cybernetic Revolution, it was originally going to be called Cybernetic Socialism,
971380	975940	but surprise surprise, MIT Press quickly changed the title, which is interesting
975940	978380	because in a way they weren't revolutionaries, they were much more
978380	979060	socialist.
979060	982740	But again, in America, I guess words mean certain things, don't they?
983940	987780	And that's also interesting where, you know, they're using like one mainframe
987780	992500	Intellics machines, though the control room looks very good where you have all
992500	996180	these guys at the top, they're basically the guys who are coordinating the
996180	999180	distribution information, it's not really a top-down thing, it's a sort of
999180	999940	coordination.
1000300	1005620	And they all have these wonderful 70s chairs and they have a space for their
1005620	1010420	glass of whiskey and cigars, like a sort of gentleman's club.
1011540	1014340	Stafford Beer obviously thought there was nothing too good for the workers.
1015180	1016460	So that's, I think, interesting.
1016460	1017580	So there's that, yeah, there's that.
1017580	1022340	And obviously, the other thing that people don't talk about, but I think is
1022340	1027060	the real big thing, is China, because they still have state planning on a
1027060	1027980	massive scale.
1027980	1031580	And one of the, you know, it's the fastest growing economy in world history.
1031900	1038100	It is the great transformation of our generation is China in the last 70 years
1038100	1040300	and particularly in the last 30, 40 years.
1040300	1044900	I mean, and state planning is absolutely at the core of this process.
1045260	1045660	Yeah.
1045660	1050580	Well, but I think that the general argument from the other side would then
1050580	1056820	be to say, well, it might be that they still are dominant in terms of planning,
1056900	1064420	but just after they opened their market to a capitalist market logic of competition
1064420	1073140	and for-profit production, they made this like huge jump and that this would
1073180	1079540	actually underline the effectiveness of markets and for-profit motive.
1080340	1084420	On the flight here, I think it's called China Daily or something, I got a copy
1084420	1088500	of and it's interesting because they're talking about the 70th anniversary and
1088500	1091820	they quite correctly point out, you see, you couldn't have had that leap without
1091820	1097620	the previous Mao period where they increased the lifespan of the population
1097620	1102780	from the average age was 35 and it increased to 64 under Mao's reign.
1102900	1107620	I mean, extraordinary education, health, that, you know, to actually have those
1107980	1110660	people who were ready to make that transition.
1111340	1115060	And that's how you can't really disentangle one from the other.
1115140	1119820	I think that, I think a lot of historians now have started to get away from that
1119820	1120980	ideological debate.
1120980	1125060	I think for us, obviously, we find talking about red Vienna, isn't it?
1125060	1130060	It's one, it's an interesting historical example, but we're, we're faced with
1130060	1131620	very different problems, I think.
1132020	1136060	And I think what the question you ask is correct, which is, you know, we, you
1136060	1141620	know, you can take some mixture of the plan and the market and you can massively
1141620	1145540	raise living standards and you could, you know, in England, you know, we could build
1145580	1147660	2 million social housing.
1147660	1152260	We could lower people's housing costs massively if we essentially reversed what
1152260	1157100	Thatcher and her successors did, which is sell off housing and now a huge bubble to
1157100	1159020	take place and all the rest of it.
1159020	1159660	That's possible.
1159660	1164020	We know how you can do that and you can do it with even within the capitalist
1164020	1164500	system.
1164900	1167500	The question then is, but how do we move beyond that?
1167740	1171980	Because a lot of the problems people have, I mean, a great example is mental
1171980	1176540	health, for instance, is to do with the stress of living under this capitalist
1176540	1181620	society, causing record level of depression and, you know, various other
1181820	1182500	ailments.
1182900	1187500	And that is to do because people don't live, they live in socially alienated
1187500	1191460	lives, meaningless lives, they think.
1192060	1193900	And so you need to create that again.
1193900	1196620	That's a, that's a sort of different level of problems, isn't it?
1196860	1198180	Yeah, definitely.
1198180	1201420	And I think that the problem then lies at the end.
1201420	1206180	If you go down the rabbit hole, it lies within the question of political economy
1206180	1210860	and that's where you figure it in the DNA, you know, in the DNA of the political
1210860	1211460	economy.
1211700	1216420	Well, of course, I mean, cause you know, a lot of political economy was, had those
1216460	1222140	questions and then they very deliberately in the academic system split them in
1222140	1223140	half politics.
1223140	1227100	I mean, I teach politics and then there's another profession called economics.
1227580	1231260	And it's interesting that you could, you know, you could spend three years at a
1231260	1235900	university doing a politics degree and know nothing about economics, but how you
1235900	1241420	could talk about the modern state without it being a class state or, you know,
1241420	1245780	bureaucratic state or, you know, all these other things that it's like that
1245780	1251260	because of this transformation that took place when we were where we moved from
1251260	1255460	feudalism to capitalism, however you put it, you know, whatever that means.
1255460	1262460	But, you know, the difference between a medieval way people produce wealth, as
1262460	1266660	Adam Smith would say, the wealth of nations, you know, the difference between
1266660	1269460	that and how we live now is just profound.
1269660	1275700	And that creates changes in the politics and culture in relation to personal
1275700	1277380	relationships and all the rest of it.
1277380	1278940	And so it's extraordinary.
1278940	1282140	You can do, and then you have economics, which is just like astrology.
1282780	1286620	It's just a sort of, you know, very complicated mathematics, garbage in,
1286620	1290900	garbage out basically, you know, and that's not that, you know, the fact that
1290900	1295180	these, these people are even considered to be academically credible is what I
1295180	1296380	find extraordinary.
1297940	1304980	So one of the, one of the tasks at hand, I guess, would be to, to implement profound
1304980	1308140	change within the economics departments at the universities.
1308140	1314340	And we can by abolish them, but the statistic, I mean, to be fair, I mean,
1314340	1319940	obviously in bourgeois economics, as we used to call it, there is very good
1319940	1323460	statistical work going on, but it's just like the basic ground theory.
1323500	1328180	The fact that when I was taught a level economics, that's 16, I was 16, I did
1328180	1333220	economics school and I remember the Trevor Jones was our teacher and the
1333220	1338980	first lesson of the, of my first year of economics, two years ago, he did the
1338980	1343180	demand and supply curve on the board and said, it's all wrong, but you have to
1343180	1344620	learn it to pass the exam.
1345020	1348220	And it was only many years later when I read Adam Smith and David
1348220	1349620	Ricard and of course, Karl Marx.
1349860	1355140	I realized what he meant is like the wrong answer to the wrong question.
1358940	1362020	And so, so to do something like that, where you have a profession that's,
1362100	1365100	who's both basic theory is such an error.
1365100	1370260	They don't know what a price is and they don't understand how prices are defined
1370260	1375300	either, so that's a bit problematic when you're studying capitalistic economics.
1376620	1381060	But that's a, that's a very interesting point because I think that's exactly one
1381060	1386380	of the points that we need to address because it works as a narrative.
1386580	1387540	That's an ideology.
1387780	1389340	Yeah, that's an idea, but it does work.
1389380	1393060	It also works if you want to collect large amounts of statistical data, because
1393060	1396180	on the, it talks about the surface forms of capitalism.
1396460	1401380	So one of its functions is to create large, you know, have large data sets.
1401380	1405780	And then you can say something about, you know, I don't know what the stock
1405780	1410580	market is going to be like in a year's time or usually wrongly, but, or, you
1410580	1414060	know, what the growth rate is, all these sorts of things, but what it can't say
1414060	1416420	is, you know, why is there a capitalist crisis?
1416580	1419700	You know, they can't, you know, the most fundamental thing of the last 10 years
1419940	1424540	has been the implosion of the, near implosion of the financial system and the
1424540	1429500	really bad policies that were adopted to prop up the world system in the last
1429620	1430260	decade.
1430420	1433700	They can't talk about that because they actually don't have the theoretical
1433700	1435660	tools that allow them to understand it.
1436180	1437220	And that is really interesting.
1437260	1438500	And then, but it's not just that.
1438500	1442860	I don't think it's just the shifting of, you know, economics from politics, but
1442860	1445820	you know, the way that anthropologies are separate, you know, history is over
1445820	1450780	here, cultural studies is over, you know, there's a whole series of these, of this
1450780	1456060	division of labor within intellectual life, which isn't talking to each other.
1457100	1461340	And then once they say in their little bubble, especially as academics are a
1461340	1465940	bit like, I don't know, they're a bit like monasteries in the 90s, in the
1465940	1469060	middle evil period where they're all doing their own, you know, chanting
1469060	1473780	Latin masses or so the rest of the population are concerned, completely
1473780	1479940	outside practical engagement in what society is doing, which again is okay
1479940	1483420	because it's good that they're accumulating knowledge about obscure
1483420	1487580	things, but it's not being reintegrated back into our society and precisely for
1487580	1488540	the problem you're talking about.
1488540	1495380	If we want to think about how do we go beyond capitalism, broadly defined, we
1495380	1499220	actually have to be able to draw on all this human experience and think about how
1499260	1504020	you do do things like complicated things, like divide and distribute labor,
1504020	1508500	create social wealth in a way that people don't find alienating, find
1508540	1513740	fulfilling, have time to look after their children and all the other things.
1514060	1516940	Having a son, I always think that's the most important thing in life,
1516940	1518100	because hanging out with him.
1518740	1526460	But could you, could you like briefly sketch how this could be done?
1527460	1534540	Because I mean, if we talk macro level-ish kind of things, and we just
1535140	1539620	briefly touched the socialist calculation debate and how they...
1540380	1544380	Well, with the Austrians, you also, it's interesting that this...
1545140	1546540	Austrian economics, I have to...
1546620	1548780	You mean Austrian economics or Austrians?
1548980	1553380	No, the Austrian economics, which was for people who hated Red Vienna.
1553780	1558260	So you think like Hayek, Mise, Schumpeter to a lesser extent, but basically
1558260	1559620	they're all, they all hate it.
1559620	1561620	You can think Hayek was a snob, wasn't he?
1561980	1566140	The idea that the proles would actually have decent housing and hang out in
1566140	1568980	coffee bars was probably his idea of hell.
1571020	1573260	And he just spent the rest of his life trying to...
1573740	1576820	It's interesting because the Road to Serfdom, which was Margaret Thatcher's
1576820	1580900	favorite book, which he wrote in exile in London.
1581540	1585900	And what he says there is if you set up a national health service,
1587060	1591300	Britain's probably greatest beloved institution, it's the straight run to
1591300	1592660	the Gulag Archipelago.
1593180	1595660	It's a completely batshit crazy book.
1595660	1598700	I mean, I'm old enough to remember Thatcher being elected.
1598980	1601860	So I went and read this book because he said this is her favorite book.
1601860	1605140	So I was going around telling you, I said, this is like Mein Kampf.
1605140	1608060	This is, you know, read it because this is what she's going to do.
1608060	1609420	You know, this is craziness.
1609780	1613180	But she's doing it because they believe in this and they did.
1613220	1614260	That's exactly what they did.
1614260	1620980	So if we want to go back to actually countering that, we need our own type of
1620980	1625540	narratives, which again, take things like the socialist calculation debate and say,
1625820	1626860	well, actually, you were wrong.
1626860	1630540	You can calculate in different ways, particularly now we've got all this
1630540	1633340	computing bow that allows us to calculate.
1633340	1637700	But the question is, what are you calculating and what is the purpose of
1637700	1638740	this calculation?
1639060	1643580	Yeah, because otherwise you end up like in Chinese central planning, you know.
1644340	1644820	Exactly.
1644820	1647500	I guess, I mean, these are two points, I guess.
1648620	1655140	One is that we need to define what we are aiming for in the sense of what's,
1655460	1661980	what's the purpose, you know, because we agree that the purpose being just profit
1661980	1664140	is one of the huge problems right now.
1664180	1670580	So we, we can put in something like a general wellbeing, you know, for
1670580	1672980	everybody, each individual.
1672980	1676420	But then there's the question of how to, I mean, but I think that's.
1677020	1680700	Stafford Beer has a really great idea, which is, you know, you go to, I don't
1680700	1685460	know, you go to hotels or restaurants or whatever, and they're more like public
1685460	1688500	transports or things and they have these little smileys which go, I don't know
1688500	1692820	whether you have them here, they are like dark green, light green, something
1692820	1696300	on red, whether you're happy or sad and you press them.
1696300	1699300	And he wanted to actually have them in everybody's home and everybody every
1699300	1701220	day would vote where they were happy or sad.
1701780	1703220	So nothing, nothing else, just where they're happy.
1703220	1706060	And obviously some people will be sad because they're sick or they quarrel
1706060	1709180	with their partner or something, but he just said all in general that the
1709180	1712580	government would know every day, whether it was the people were happier than sad.
1713140	1717500	So you just said the government, that's, that's my, my, my point of entry, I guess,
1717500	1718180	because I mean.
1718460	1720500	Well, he was doing it for the Chilean government.
1721100	1726460	I think my question is just, uh, there's this, um, I do see one of the narratives
1726460	1731980	popping up that, uh, against the, you know, Austrian, uh, narrative of, uh,
1732420	1737380	price as being the supreme price and market mechanisms, uh, being the supreme
1737380	1739260	mechanism of allocation of resources.
1740940	1742540	You've got the Austro Marxist approach.
1743860	1747060	And then there's this, I mean, there's the narrative that is popping up right
1747060	1748900	now, which is kind of, all right.
1748940	1755620	Um, uh, we can see in, uh, large scale companies like Walmart or Amazon and
1755620	1759060	anything that, uh, planned economy is possible in general.
1759220	1765860	So let's try this with different, um, uh, uh, goals, of course, you know, not
1765860	1771420	for profit, but that would imply some kind of, uh, centrally planned economy.
1771420	1775700	But it, it seems as if what you're promoting is not a centrally planned
1775700	1779740	economy, but a more decentralized, um,
1779780	1783860	Well, centralization is inevitable though, in a way, because we're, you
1783860	1785100	think about the world economy.
1785100	1789940	It's also slowly going into three zones, China, Europe, and North America.
1790180	1791140	And these are very large.
1791140	1795500	Europe is a very large group of people who are all, um, okay.
1795500	1798580	We might be very, I think we're very diverse, but to outsiders, they
1798580	1799460	all think we're the same.
1799940	1803420	I had a Chinese student this year who came up with, she said to me very
1803420	1807900	soon, she said, I don't understand why the Europeans keep quarreling with each
1807900	1808180	other.
1808460	1811420	Why don't you form a strong centralized state?
1811420	1812180	Like we did.
1812300	1817100	It's been very successful from which country was China, China.
1817140	1817820	Ah, okay.
1817820	1818060	Yeah.
1818140	1821500	So for that Charles, she's concerned, you know, the last 70 years is the
1821500	1823420	best in Chinese history.
1823820	1828340	And it's because they created in 1945 a strong centralized state and it had
1828340	1832220	driven the country forward into the, you know, whatever, you know, prosperity
1832220	1836900	media, was it a mediumly prosperous ecological civilization, or whatever
1836900	1838580	the latest phraseology is.
1839300	1841500	So, but what would, what would be your
1842060	1845140	I'm not, I'm not really in favor of Confucian socialism.
1845140	1845420	Yes.
1846740	1847820	But what are you in favor?
1847860	1849100	Well, that's what I'm saying.
1849100	1854740	I think it's interesting that the, what, uh, from the experiences of, uh, labor,
1854740	1858540	local governments in the 1980s, which is, you know, the present leadership
1858580	1863140	lay party comes very much out of the Greater London Council, the GLC, and
1863140	1865620	other left labor councils in the 1980s.
1866220	1870540	Thatcher closed down because they were two good examples of what you could do
1870540	1876460	instead, and a lot of that was moving away from top down paternistic, but, and
1876460	1880500	to create bottom up cooperative type structures, but I don't think it's a
1880500	1885060	centralization seat decent enough, because often to make the, you need
1885060	1887140	economies of scale often to make them work.
1887140	1888220	So it's only the Preston model.
1888220	1891100	If they just had a few co-ops, they, okay, that works.
1891100	1894500	But once you start getting lots of co-ops and they all start to
1894820	1897660	collaborate with each other, sometimes they might be buying and selling.
1897660	1900420	Other times they just might be working together in other ways.
1900780	1906700	You start to actually generate more productive wealth, but also I think
1906700	1910900	the other key thing is it empowers people and it changes people politically
1910900	1913620	and culturally, and they feel more self-confident.
1913620	1914620	That's the other key thing.
1914860	1918300	Lots of the other problem, the high ECU model, of course, is it just treats
1918300	1920180	people as disposable commodities.
1920900	1925660	And, you know, we had zero, I don't, you know, zero hours contracts and stress.
1925660	1928060	And as I said, all the stuff we were talking about before, and if you
1928060	1930980	create healthier and happier people, that's what they want to do.
1930980	1931940	People want to contribute.
1931940	1936060	They would like to contribute to society, but they need to be happy as well.
1936100	1938420	So that seems to be a key thing.
1939860	1943820	So I'm a bit wary about the centralization decentralization debate,
1943980	1945580	particularly because of Brexit.
1946460	1949700	We suddenly, suddenly everyone's in favor of the federal Republic of Europe.
1950340	1951700	That's one thing the Brexiteers have done.
1951700	1956660	They've actually made the English, who had the major Europhobic problem.
1956860	1961260	They've actually created a mass pro-European movement in England, which is bizarre.
1961500	1964340	I had never thought I'd see demonstrations with large numbers of
1964340	1966660	people flying European flags.
1967100	1970940	And then if you go to the Labour Party, the two flags that people have on their
1970940	1976020	badges and all the rest of it are one Palestine, for obvious reasons.
1976380	1980380	And the second, the second is the European Union, which seemed
1980380	1982340	like a strange combination.
1983540	1988460	You can see that all around, I guess, because oftentimes it's also in the
1988460	1991700	public discourse, that's how it is being presented.
1991700	1999620	It's either the right-wing nationalists or the liberalism as we knew it.
1999620	2009300	And in the, let's say, mainstream media, in lack of any other term, it's described
2009300	2011220	as if there's nothing else, you know?
2011260	2013860	Well, that's what they have, and that is the classic mainstream media, like the
2013860	2015780	choice between a liberal or a fascist.
2016020	2016340	Yeah.
2016380	2018100	Macron had it, the Macron election.
2018100	2019740	You have a choice between a liberal or a fascist.
2019900	2020220	Yeah.
2021940	2022860	What's the choice?
2022860	2023740	That's not the choice.
2024700	2026060	So you'll opt for...
2026060	2026780	Socialism.
2027340	2029980	...cybernetic communism, I read somewhere.
2030100	2030980	Yes, exactly.
2031140	2034300	Do you have a catchy phrase, how you define cybernetic communism?
2035500	2037620	Well, that came out of the Imaginary Futures book.
2037660	2043180	I was just, I was interested, this came from this thing that the origin myth of
2043180	2048700	the internet is that somehow it was a system to survive a nuclear war, and this
2048700	2052620	goes back to the Paul Barron report in the early 1960s.
2052860	2058060	He wrote for the Rand Corporation, funded by the US Air Force, and notorious for
2058220	2060140	promoting the invasion of Vietnam.
2061380	2063660	But it struck me as that was just like very unlikely.
2063660	2068940	Why would you replace cheap, reliable switches with expensive, flaky mainframes?
2068980	2071820	I mean, we're not talking about the sort of chips we have in our mobile phones.
2071820	2075100	We're talking about computers the size of a room, right?
2075100	2077060	So this just, this didn't make sense.
2077060	2081180	And so it was only digging, actually, I didn't even do that much research, but
2081220	2085660	once you actually go and read some of the conferences from the early 1960s, the
2085660	2091740	1964 American Cybernetic Society, being an obvious example, they're terrified.
2091740	2094980	They all say the Russians are going to build the internet within four years.
2095780	2100620	So that's why they're doing it, because they've had Sputnik, the Americans lost
2100620	2105220	the race to put the first satellite, and then you have Yuri Gagarin, they lost the
2105220	2110340	race to put the first human into space, and Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman
2110340	2115180	into space. So they, you know, all these key milestones on that particular thing.
2115260	2117500	That's why they always go on about landing on the moon, because they have to
2117780	2122260	say that they lost all the early parts of the space race.
2123020	2127740	So that they then invented ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projectation, and its
2127740	2131060	next project was to stop cybernetic communism.
2131700	2136700	Nikita Khrushchev, in the 22nd Party Congress, actually said the Soviet Union
2136700	2139540	will enter cybernetic communism in the 1970s.
2140740	2144500	That we will solve all the problems of central planning by building a giant
2144500	2145020	mainframe.
2145780	2151340	But they didn't. I mean, there was the attempt in Chile, with Stafford Beer, but
2151380	2152740	and there were attempts in the...
2153100	2157940	No, they got terrified, they got scared, because in 1968, during the Prague Spring,
2158260	2164900	Radovan Ritka, and the Academy of Sciences in Czechoslovakia, published this book
2164900	2166860	called Civilization at the Crossroads.
2166860	2172620	And it says, Stalinism is the industrial age, and we're about to enter the
2172620	2177300	Information Society, and this will be cybernetic communism, by the Party.
2178420	2179860	And so they just got really scared.
2179860	2182580	They suddenly thought, well, if we set up computer networks everywhere.
2183580	2186660	So they weren't as clever as the Chinese, you see, they just got terrified.
2186660	2189700	They just thought people would use it to self-organize, which of course they did.
2191100	2195500	But, you know, still couldn't stop solidarity in Poland, could they?
2197260	2198060	So that's interesting.
2198060	2204940	So everybody shut down the different way of approaching cybernetics, actually.
2204940	2210140	The United States shut it down in Chile, and the Soviets did it by themselves,
2210140	2210580	actually.
2210580	2212420	They didn't need somebody else to do it, no?
2212660	2212900	No, no.
2212900	2214820	Well, that's one of the reasons they didn't get the internet.
2214900	2215700	I think it's really interesting.
2215700	2221820	I have friends who grew up in Soviet, and every computer network was, you couldn't
2221820	2223740	actually operate from one network to the other.
2224100	2225660	They already did this with telephones.
2225660	2228940	They used to have layered telephone systems, which is why you should see
2228940	2231340	those pictures of Soviet bureaucrats.
2231340	2234900	They have like six telephones on their desk because it shows you've got more
2234900	2238500	telephones the further you went up the hierarchy because you've got access to
2238500	2242820	a special network, and they did the same thing because they were afraid if you
2242820	2245740	had one telephone system, anybody could ring anybody else.
2246980	2249140	And that's another thing.
2249180	2253860	When we come back to, when we're thinking about, you know, how modernity has
2253860	2258140	progressed, the command and control, top-down command and control is really
2258140	2262620	important, because at each stage of technology, there's a debate, a struggle,
2262820	2270540	actually, a social shaping of technology over who's going to control it.
2270540	2272740	Is it going to be bottom-up or is it going to be top-down?
2274140	2276740	And the internet is a very classic example of that.
2277700	2283220	And it's a super important part you're just mentioning because one of the
2284020	2290460	titles of a chapter within an essay that Evgeny Morozov just recently published
2290460	2295220	in the New Left Review, the whole essay is called Digital Socialism, but one of
2295220	2300940	the chapters, it's titled Socialize the Means of Feedback Production!
2301300	2309420	So that would be an obvious barrier, you know, because right now the means of
2309420	2317020	feedback production, that would actually be the ground upon which such a cybernetic
2317740	2325500	planned economy could be done, you know, they are right now owned privately by
2325500	2333980	huge corporations and a necessary step would be to socialize these means of
2333980	2334700	feedback production.
2335460	2337780	Well, all to supersede them.
2337900	2342220	That's, well, in a sense, but you think something like Google is effectively owned
2342220	2347620	by the state, I mean, it's, you know, it's a creation of the National Security Agency.
2347900	2349340	But it's not owned by the state.
2349340	2351300	But it's effectively controlled by the Americans.
2351500	2355020	I mean, it's when they go on and on about the Americans, but not by the state, no?
2355380	2357060	By the elite, then, okay.
2357620	2361260	But you think when they go on about Huawei, they go on about Huawei in the back doors,
2361260	2365500	allegedly, in its technology, and you think they're just talking about themselves.
2365500	2366500	That's what they're doing.
2366900	2367700	Now, what's Google?
2367700	2369700	It's a giant information machine.
2369700	2373580	We're sucking up data for the national security state in America.
2373580	2374540	I mean, you have a choice now.
2374540	2378620	Do you want to be spied, use Apple and be spied on by the American secret police or
2378620	2381060	Huawei and be spied on by the Chinese secret police?
2381580	2384140	I mean, that's a great choice for you, isn't it?
2384540	2384700	Yeah.
2384700	2388740	So that there would have to be a different kind of entity.
2389420	2392580	When you talk about socializing, they are socialized already.
2392580	2394300	It's just how they're socialized.
2394820	2399220	So what does it, you know, socially, you know, it's what Mark, again, what Mark points out
2399220	2402380	in volume three of capital, a joint stock company is a form of social ownership.
2402380	2403580	It's just a social ownership.
2403980	2408580	It's structured in a particular way to benefit a particular class.
2408580	2411260	But you see, so it's not individual ownership.
2411260	2412900	It is a form of social ownership.
2412900	2417780	So Google is a form of social ownership, which, you know, the founder, the two founders
2417820	2419820	basically own it outright.
2419820	2423500	I mean, the shares are traded, but they don't really, they can't appoint the board of
2423500	2428980	directors. So so who they who they're accountable to.
2429460	2430780	I mean, that's another question.
2430780	2433260	You know, I said it was originally funded by the NSA.
2433260	2438420	So you could think if you go back enough through the interconnections of the American
2438420	2442100	elite. But it's not possible to right now.
2442100	2448260	It's that the information that is selected, you know, it's not possible to use to
2448260	2454780	build some, you know, I don't know, a cooperative project built upon the data
2454780	2457540	that is being collected because they are protecting it.
2457580	2463540	Well, not just that is that what we've all been using Google for 20 odd years and
2463540	2465100	building up its knowledge base.
2465700	2469740	That's the key thing. If you could, you could theoretically build a better search
2469740	2475180	engine. But what you wouldn't have is 20 years of searches done by millions of
2475180	2479820	people. And that's what gives it its edge over anybody else is that embedded
2479820	2480980	knowledge, which everybody has.
2481420	2486860	We've all helped build Google or Apple or Amazon or any of these companies.
2486860	2489380	So it is in a way they are socialized.
2489380	2491540	It's just how they're socialized.
2492340	2495220	They're not. It's like, again, it's not the Austrian school.
2495220	2498140	It's all about the individual consumer.
2500420	2503700	But that's actually not how society we're talking about millions, billions of
2503700	2509700	people collectively creating something, how it's captured and molded.
2509740	2511460	That's a completely different question.
2511820	2514500	But I don't think I think socialization is the wrong word.
2514660	2515820	Oh, really interesting.
2515860	2517380	They already socialized.
2517380	2518620	They've been socialized.
2518780	2519900	They've always been socialized.
2519900	2523540	They were socialized when they were funded at Stanford University.
2524140	2527580	The corporations are social institutions.
2527620	2529260	They just run as dictatorships.
2530100	2535820	Well, I think with the word socialized, I associate the common ownership, you know,
2535820	2540660	that everybody would have access to the benefits of it.
2540700	2542300	Well, you do. You do with Google.
2542460	2543060	You can use it.
2543060	2548860	Well, yeah, I can I can use it to Google something by which I just add some more
2548860	2552940	of the information to their databases.
2553180	2555180	But we want to get our hands on the databases.
2555180	2556300	And you benefit from that.
2556340	2560220	The fact that they've accumulated all this knowledge, you type something rather
2560220	2562540	esoteric into it, it suddenly throws up.
2562540	2566780	I mean, a lot of it is junk, but then by going through it and sort you help them
2566780	2571340	sort it by what's relevant and the next person who types in the same piece of
2571340	2574620	rubbish gets a more hopefully gets a more accurate feeding.
2574620	2575740	So yeah, yeah, yeah.
2575740	2580300	But still, I do not get it because I mean, if you take some industry and it
2580300	2585620	builds some houses and I can profit by living in this house, it's still the the
2585620	2588820	company that builds the houses is not socialized because the means of
2588820	2593420	production are not within common ownership.
2593420	2595740	So so that would be different.
2595740	2597420	It is a form of common ownership.
2597940	2598540	Come again, sir.
2598540	2599820	It is a form of common ownership.
2599820	2601460	It's just run as a dictatorship.
2601460	2606620	It's not in the in the sorts of Austrian school fantasy economics that you're
2606620	2608860	taught at school or even Keynesian.
2608860	2611860	But you are always treated as an individual.
2611860	2615060	It's all about individual consumers, individual producers.
2615780	2619340	But that's why the joint stock company becomes an immediate problem.
2619340	2623620	You know, there's, I don't know, the theory of the firm and all that sort of stuff.
2623620	2626980	I mean, one of that thing is that they prove that companies by definition can
2626980	2628820	be more efficient than markets.
2628820	2632580	That's what Adam Smith says at the beginning of volume one of The Wealth of Nations.
2632580	2634940	There's two ways of dividing and distributing labor.
2634940	2635740	One is the market.
2635740	2640740	The other is the firm or the state, depending on how you look at it, the plan,
2640740	2643100	whatever you call it, then there's two different ways.
2643100	2646340	And so this is not something new that you can know.
2646340	2648460	The pin factory is not a market.
2648900	2651740	They don't buy and sell each the bits of the pin to each other.
2652300	2653500	But you could do it like that.
2653500	2656620	Theoretically, I mean, to a high equity, you think that's actually how you do it.
2656620	2658460	They don't want to have the firm at all, really.
2658460	2662980	They just want to have everything, you know, internal markets for everything.
2663420	2666300	There are people who tried that miserably.
2666300	2667980	I know they tried it at our university.
2667980	2671180	They were going to have a sort of bidding for office space in the same way.
2671180	2671660	Really?
2671740	2672860	Oh, yeah, you know, it was just like this.
2672860	2675500	It was like the I think it was actually was the Blair period
2675500	2679340	where they got even more bizarrely entranced by all this.
2680140	2684460	But you can see again, you can see that in the EU where markets
2684460	2688860	become a sort of technocratic solution because they're not democratic by definition.
2689860	2693500	And, you know, you want to have a solution and it all looks very nice.
2693500	2697580	You know, you can just set down a set of policies and it works in the university.
2699300	2700940	So I think I think that's the problem.
2700940	2704060	So when you think or talk about socializing, something like that,
2704060	2705260	they already are social.
2705260	2707500	It's just that they're not democratic or open.
2707500	2708220	That's the key thing.
2708220	2713020	So what you should be talking about is democratizing them or opening them up
2713020	2714540	and sharing the knowledge.
2715180	2719900	That's also, I think, very new because our starting point somehow was
2719900	2722940	that the need for new imaginaries.
2722940	2729100	And I think this is a very nice imaginary to democratize economies, you know.
2729100	2732620	So, you know, I have worked with a colleague called Christian Fuchs.
2732620	2734220	He's a very, you know, very smart guy.
2734220	2738460	But he was going on about nationalizing Google, basically.
2738460	2739820	And that's what friends of mine pulled out.
2739820	2741180	One, it basically is national.
2741180	2744700	It's one sense it is nationalized because it's because of its connection
2744700	2747260	with the security apparatus.
2747260	2751100	And the second thing, the whole point isn't actually to get away from
2751100	2755980	that type of model of software, you know, having one giant big server,
2756540	2759340	basically, model of software.
2759340	2761900	I mean, they, you know, they write the software.
2761900	2764380	So they would say, well, that's part of the problem.
2764380	2769260	Yes, just turning it from nominally owned by its two founders
2769260	2773660	and Wall Street Investor, the venture capitalists or whatever.
2773660	2777500	I think actually, I think it is basically owned by the two founders nowadays
2777500	2780460	because all the rest of the shares don't actually have any voting right.
2780460	2781900	But it doesn't really matter.
2782540	2786860	It's actually the model of centralizing all the information in one company
2786860	2787580	is the problem.
2787580	2791260	And really what you want to do is have, you know, distributed forms of,
2792940	2796060	if you were to do a search engine, it should be a distributed search engine,
2796060	2799660	not this particular model that came out of the 1990s.
2800220	2803020	So I think that's an interesting debate where they're actually saying,
2803020	2806620	well, you know, it's not just taking the same technology
2806620	2809740	and just changing the ownership to, you know, Google,
2810700	2817260	PLC or private, you know, private corporation to state corporation.
2817260	2819740	Or it's something more than that.
2819740	2823660	Or even calling it a co-op, you know, a co-op of its workers or something.
2823660	2826700	It's actually to change the technology itself.
2826700	2830860	The part of the problem is that it's designed as top-down technology.
2830860	2834060	And so simply just changing the ownership, calling it socialized.
2834620	2839660	It's like, as I said, it's like thinking, it's like Confucian socialism, isn't it?
2840140	2841500	The form of Confucian socialism.
2843100	2847340	And what you really want to do is actually not only change its ownership,
2847340	2852540	but change the type of software and the way the software operates in the network.
2852540	2857020	And again, I'm not an expert in software or hardware,
2857020	2859660	but this seems to be a very interesting idea.
2859660	2861980	When we come back to the shaping of technology,
2862860	2866780	that it looks, you know, we go around doing things because it's,
2866860	2871020	you know, lots of social relations are embedded in the technologies that we use,
2871740	2872940	hardwares and software.
2873500	2876620	And so we just adopt type of behavior patterns
2876620	2883180	because it's essentially, that's how it's the easy way to operate your life, basically.
2883740	2887900	And it's teaching you to operate in a sense of social relation.
2887900	2891020	So simply to, you know, declare Google red.
2892220	2894860	It's not going to make, it's actually not going to solve the problem.
2894860	2896140	Yeah, you're absolutely right.
2896140	2898700	So he already distributes his project for free anyway.
2900220	2901180	It is communism.
2901180	2901660	It's free.
2903820	2906220	I think they charged me five euros to go to that exhibition.
2906220	2907580	I thought that was quite overrunning, really.
2908300	2909020	The moza?
2909020	2909740	Ah, yeah, yeah.
2909740	2911980	I said, socialism should be free, mate.
2915180	2916460	They haven't got to communism yet.
2916460	2919020	They're obviously just in the transitional phase, aren't they?
2919020	2920940	Where they still have to charge you money to go in.
2921740	2925500	Oh, another approach that is currently discussed,
2925500	2930060	or actually since like three or four years is being put out there
2930060	2934700	and that I wanted to check what your position is towards,
2934700	2939100	is this concept of fully automated luxury communism by Aaron Bastani.
2939100	2940140	Oh yeah, that's wonderful.
2940140	2941660	I read that book.
2941660	2945260	I actually had to debate with Aaron on his books.
2945260	2946780	Oh, I'll have to check that one.
2946780	2947660	Is there a video?
2947660	2948540	Yeah, sure it is.
2949180	2952620	It was done in Newspeak House.
2955420	2958700	Okay, I have to get my hands on this audio or video recording.
2959500	2961500	It was done for virtual futures.
2961500	2963020	That's what I'm trying to think.
2963020	2964860	All right, so you like the book.
2964860	2965820	You like the concept.
2966460	2967340	How do I like the book?
2967340	2968300	That's a really good question.
2968300	2969420	I was being very polite.
2970620	2971900	I could have been nastier to it.
2971900	2973660	But I think the good thing,
2973660	2975340	I think there's lots of problems with the book.
2975340	2977820	I mean, there's all the things like mining asteroids,
2977820	2979660	which are completely bonkers in my view.
2981100	2982300	But that's a different question.
2982300	2984860	I think what's good about it is it's very positive.
2984860	2986860	And what you need, as you said,
2986860	2989900	in a way it's not so much whether or not you agree with the utopia.
2991820	2994140	It's whether it's the fact that people are going out and saying,
2994140	2996700	well, we can build a post-capitalist society.
2996700	3000060	It's very technological determinism.
3000060	3001260	That's my problem with it.
3002460	3007100	Because I think, and I just have been, as I said,
3007180	3008300	having read capital,
3008300	3011020	I have a big problem with the words fully automated.
3011900	3014860	Because I think that that actually is a vision
3014860	3017580	of being dominated by technology.
3018220	3021100	Because that's not reshaping the machine.
3021100	3025100	That's expelling living labor from the production process,
3025100	3026300	which you don't want to do.
3026300	3030860	What you want to be able to do is control the production of goods and services.
3032300	3034780	That's like, you know, it's like basic income.
3035580	3037740	I always feel this is a very dubious concept.
3037740	3039180	Because, you know, welfare for all.
3039180	3040860	That's quite good when you're in a 20-year thing.
3040860	3041340	That's great.
3041340	3045020	I could just go and collect a cheque every week and have fun.
3046060	3047340	But I don't think that really, you know,
3047340	3050940	what you really want to do is have basic services.
3050940	3053900	You know, the good example in Britain is that health care is free.
3053900	3056220	And so, in fact, she would have loved to privatize.
3056220	3058060	If we'd had charging for health care,
3058060	3060140	we'd have really expensive health care now.
3060140	3062300	But because it was free, she couldn't do it.
3062300	3064540	They can try and privatize the back end.
3064540	3069180	But if you tried to introduce charging for health care in England,
3069180	3072460	there'd be a revolt, even among right-wing voters.
3073100	3074700	And so, that's a really interesting thing.
3074700	3081020	So, there was a discussion in the 1980s about abolishing public transport fares,
3082300	3085740	which I spoke in favor of when they edited this.
3085740	3087740	And the unions didn't want to do this
3087740	3090940	because there were people involved in selling and collecting tickets.
3091900	3096060	And but if they'd abolished fares, they couldn't reintroduce them.
3096060	3099180	I just think now we have very expensive public transport in London.
3099180	3100540	But I think if they abolished it,
3102220	3105260	it's very, very difficult to reintroduce it once it's done.
3105260	3107260	That's a very good point you're making, I guess,
3107260	3111340	because that would be an essential first step would be
3111340	3118940	to create universal basic services for housing, for transport, for education, for health,
3118940	3126540	and really build thick structures around it that are able to last for a long, long time.
3126540	3131580	And thereby, what's the same with universities, because university used to be free.
3131580	3133180	And then it is here exactly.
3133180	3135740	And then Blair introduced very low fees.
3135740	3137660	And there were people making excuses.
3137660	3141340	And I remember saying at the time, well, if you introduce low fees, they'll be higher.
3141340	3143980	Because that's the point is just to get people used to paying something.
3144620	3147260	And once you pay something, then you can charge them 50 grand a year.
3147820	3148780	And that is the point.
3148780	3153340	So I think one of the things is taking things out of the market,
3153340	3157820	the basic things in life, health care, education, housing.
3157820	3162300	And then you can have, you know, then people want to buy and sell other things.
3162300	3162940	That's fine.
3164220	3166380	What's the next step after that?
3167100	3169900	Let's imagine a future where this has happened.
3169900	3174460	Where our children, where our little children are going to do.
3174460	3178940	Do a Keynesian, the future of my grandchildren kind of thing.
3178940	3180140	What would that be?
3181180	3181580	What do you mean?
3181580	3184700	The four-day week, the three-day week, you know, that sort of thing.
3184700	3189900	The Labour Party has actually adopted a policy of introducing a four-day week.
3189900	3190300	Yeah.
3190300	3192860	Which again, it's one of the mistakes the French Socialist Party did is
3192860	3196220	they reduced the working week, but not by a whole day.
3196220	3201260	And so they actually, it's been very difficult in France to push work back up again.
3201980	3204940	And it doesn't seem to have affected the French economy that hugely.
3205500	3207820	But they always have, if you read right-wing papers,
3207820	3210220	they're always going on and on about the restriction on the working week.
3210220	3214780	But you think if they give them the whole extra day off, that would have really screwed.
3214780	3218940	Because, you know, they've never been able to, even the Popular Front in the 1930s,
3218940	3223100	the 1936 Front Popular, they introduced the Grand Vacances,
3223900	3231100	which, so basically France closes down in August, thanks to the workers' rebellion in 1936.
3231900	3233900	It's a bit annoying sometimes when you're a tourist,
3234860	3236540	but you do think that was an achievement.
3236540	3237900	And the same thing in England.
3237900	3245100	We basically, from Christmas Eve to past New Year's Eve, the whole of England closes down.
3245100	3247660	And this is from the 1970s strikes.
3247660	3249900	We had all these massive strikes.
3249900	3255180	And the great achievement, even now, despite all these decades of neoliberalism,
3255180	3261020	is the whole country closes down on Christmas Eve and doesn't reopen until after New Year's Day.
3262060	3264940	So those sorts of spaces, I think, are really interesting.
3264940	3267580	It's interesting, though, things like National Health Service and
3267580	3269500	the long winter Christmas holiday.
3269500	3272620	Those are essentially what they find really difficult to roll back,
3272620	3277340	that shows you what really powerful achievements that people aren't really willing to give up,
3277340	3281100	however much shit they're reading from the mainstream media.
3282540	3287020	So we've got this, like, next step thing,
3287020	3291500	which would be the Universal Baker's Basic Services kind of thing.
3291500	3294380	And a shorter working week.
3294380	3296140	I think that would make people happy.
3296140	3299900	And then after that, if we get that, if we get a four-day week,
3301260	3304700	same payment, of course, then a three-day week, and then...
3305820	3307580	What do you mean, ecotopia?
3307580	3308300	I don't know.
3308300	3309500	Where do we go from there?
3309500	3313580	You know, what are you pushing for?
3313580	3316620	We hunt in the morning and read poetry in the afternoon.
3317100	3320060	Yeah, I mean, that would be one of the...
3320780	3324300	Not finalists, of course, the wrong term and the wrong idea to it.
3324300	3325260	But that would be a...
3325900	3329580	Charles Fourier, who thought he should overcome the division of labour.
3329580	3330380	That's what he...
3330380	3332620	Every four hours, you'd switch jobs or...
3333260	3336780	Yeah, but you needn't have to do that, you know?
3338300	3344060	For me, at least, there's an inner image where I'm free to
3344700	3349980	do the work that I intrinsically want to do.
3349980	3352060	And I'm not a lazy person.
3352060	3356140	I just want to decide myself what I want to put my efforts in.
3356140	3359260	And also, people like being with other people.
3359260	3363100	And if they got a collective project that's to the social benefit,
3363100	3364700	it makes them feel happy doing it.
3364700	3365180	Yeah, yeah.
3365180	3367980	I mean, that's the difficulty is how do you turn
3368540	3372220	the sort of production of goods and services that we have
3372220	3374300	into a society which is democratic?
3374300	3377260	Because it's been so built on class hierarchy.
3378140	3381020	It's funny that here you get people who claim that this isn't a class...
3381020	3384300	They say, oh, England's terrible, it's divided into classes
3384300	3386140	as if Austria isn't divided.
3386140	3387980	I just look at them with that absolutely black...
3387980	3389260	I think you just...
3389260	3392220	Obviously, again, the ideology here is, you know,
3392220	3393980	it's all social consensus, everyone's happy.
3395500	3398300	There are still people, you know, in the hotel, cleaning the hotel,
3398700	3402380	I mean, waiting in bars.
3403180	3405660	So let's, I mean, maybe it's counterproductive,
3405660	3408860	but still I have to ask, let's put a name tag on it.
3408860	3410060	Communism.
3410060	3411020	All right.
3411020	3412460	Just to annoy Americans.
3413500	3416780	I used to call myself communist until I started going to America as an adult.
3416780	3417420	And then you really...
3417420	3419900	Because you say anything left with you, you try and explain,
3419900	3422380	no, I'm a social democrat or a...
3422380	3425260	Whatever, then you just gave up and just say, no, I'm a communist.
3425260	3427420	And then they get, I mean, probably not now,
3427420	3429340	but I always remember that people would be really shocked.
3429340	3433500	They never met anybody who actually would say this
3433500	3436700	and not be, you know, a Stalivist or something.
3436700	3437340	Yeah.
3437340	3440380	And I just recently heard that, because I'm really interested,
3440380	3446140	I heard that there are people calling themselves radical social democrats.
3446140	3448060	I never heard of that before, but I just recently heard...
3448060	3449020	Oh, this one of mine used to say,
3449020	3451260	we should call ourselves libertarian social democrats,
3451260	3452620	because that's LSD.
3453340	3455340	Okay, I see.
3455340	3458780	So I've got the class of the new, how's this at the end, libertarian social,
3458780	3459660	because it was his joke.
3459660	3460860	And I just thought it was such a great...
3460860	3463740	And the funny thing is the only person who got the joke were the Russians.
3463740	3467020	The Russians got the joke immediately and no one else did.
3468860	3469740	They all got the joke.
3470540	3472300	One last question I'm always asking.
3472300	3475020	If you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
3476300	3477100	My little boy.
3478300	3479740	I think he's my little...
3479740	3480620	He's my future.
3481100	3484620	Some Christian came up to me outside the shopping centre and said,
3484620	3486060	what happened to you?
3486060	3487580	Will you live on after death?
3487580	3489980	And I pointed to Artie and said, look, here he is.
3493100	3495980	I think, well, yeah, he makes you optimistic.
3495980	3499580	You see them crying up, hopefully he leaves them a better world.
3500460	3501900	Richard, thanks a lot.
3501900	3502780	Cheers, thank you.
3503660	3504860	Long live Red Vienna.
