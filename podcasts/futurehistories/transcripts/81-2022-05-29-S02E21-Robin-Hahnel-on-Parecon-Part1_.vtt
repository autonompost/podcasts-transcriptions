00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
Welcome to Huge Histories.

00:01.800 --> 00:05.000
My name is Jan Groos, and it is my great pleasure

00:05.000 --> 00:08.080
to welcome Robin Hannell in today's episode.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.840
He is professor of economics at Portland State University,

00:11.840 --> 00:13.740
and together with Michael Albert,

00:13.740 --> 00:18.000
he developed Paracon, short for participatory economics,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.400
which is one of the most popular models

00:20.400 --> 00:23.080
for democratic economic planning there is,

00:23.080 --> 00:27.040
and it has been around for more than 30 years now.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.240
I really wanted to cover Paracon as thoroughly as possible,

00:31.240 --> 00:34.160
leading to more than four hours of material

00:34.160 --> 00:36.880
of which you will hear roughly the first half

00:36.880 --> 00:37.720
in this episode.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.760
The second part will be released in two weeks.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.480
And just to give you some orientation,

00:43.480 --> 00:46.360
we begin by going through the model bit by bit,

00:46.360 --> 00:49.280
and I kind of spared my critical questions

00:49.280 --> 00:53.360
for after the model has been laid out in full.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.440
This conversation is part of a small series

00:56.440 --> 00:58.840
in which I cover some of the classical models

00:58.840 --> 01:00.600
of democratic economic planning

01:00.600 --> 01:02.960
by talking to their creators.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.920
I already did an interview with David Leibman

01:05.920 --> 01:09.040
on multi-level democratic iterative coordination

01:09.040 --> 01:11.960
in episode 19 of season two,

01:11.960 --> 01:14.320
and soon there will be a double episode

01:14.320 --> 01:16.660
with Pat Devine as well.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.880
Since all of these episodes are in English,

01:18.880 --> 01:20.960
and since there are quite a couple

01:20.960 --> 01:24.080
of other Future Histories episodes in English by now,

01:24.080 --> 01:27.000
we created an English episode only feed

01:27.000 --> 01:28.840
that you can subscribe to.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.480
So if you don't speak German

01:30.480 --> 01:33.720
and you are simply waiting

01:33.720 --> 01:35.880
for the next English episode of Future Histories,

01:35.880 --> 01:39.240
please go ahead and take a look at the show notes

01:39.240 --> 01:43.520
where you will find a link to the English only RSS feed

01:43.520 --> 01:47.160
as well as the newly created English version

01:47.160 --> 01:48.560
of the homepage.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.320
Please share among your English speaking friends.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.000
I'm always very grateful for propaganda.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.720
This is really very helpful

01:55.720 --> 02:00.480
and maybe share in all of your different networks too.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
Thank you so much.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.120
And speaking of thanks, thank you Bernhard, Fabian

02:06.120 --> 02:08.440
and Wilfried for their kind donations.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.400
And there's a special kind of Patreon support that happened.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.520
Happy birthday to Daniel from Malte

02:15.520 --> 02:17.960
who became a Patreon supporter of Future Histories

02:17.960 --> 02:20.160
as a birthday gift to Daniel.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.360
And this is very heartwarming to me.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.640
And I feel honored that this was gifted.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.240
So double thanks to Malte and Daniel.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.040
But now please enjoy today's episode

02:32.040 --> 02:35.320
and in-depth interview with Robin Hanell

02:35.320 --> 02:37.880
on participatory economics.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.240
Welcome Robin.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.600
Good to be with you.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.040
It's a pleasure.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.000
We will hopefully get into quite some detail

02:51.000 --> 02:52.280
about Perikan today,

02:52.280 --> 02:55.640
but let's start with an overview and broad definition.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.080
What is Perikan?

02:58.040 --> 03:03.040
It's an attempt to say something concrete

03:03.040 --> 03:07.040
about what it is that we think that socialists

03:08.440 --> 03:11.640
should be proposing as the kind of economic system

03:12.960 --> 03:16.720
that we wanna replace capitalism with in the 21st century.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.920
In the light of all of the experiences

03:21.920 --> 03:25.720
with different attempts to create a socialist economy

03:25.720 --> 03:28.480
in the 20th century, what lessons have we learned

03:28.480 --> 03:32.320
and what should we now be proposing?

03:32.320 --> 03:34.960
It's our proposal of what we left us

03:34.960 --> 03:36.600
who wanna replace capitalism

03:36.600 --> 03:38.360
with a far better economic system,

03:38.360 --> 03:42.440
a kind of socialism that's very democratic

03:42.440 --> 03:45.240
and that encourages popular participation.

03:47.720 --> 03:52.480
And the other thing is that we thought that for too long,

03:52.480 --> 03:56.920
anti-capitalists have just been very vague

03:56.920 --> 04:01.920
about what it is they want in light of the Soviet experience

04:02.320 --> 04:04.800
in the Eastern European countries and Cuba.

04:06.480 --> 04:11.320
In light of all that, we felt like reasonable people

04:11.320 --> 04:14.160
would expect, you have to say something

04:14.200 --> 04:17.440
a little more concrete than just your values

04:17.440 --> 04:20.400
and your wishes for how the economy should work.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.000
So we thought, well, let's begin that process

04:24.000 --> 04:27.240
by making some very, very concrete proposals

04:27.240 --> 04:29.240
about how all the different kinds of decisions

04:29.240 --> 04:31.680
that have to be made, how they might best be made,

04:31.680 --> 04:33.480
and then we can all talk about it.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.040
So that was the motivation, that was the purpose

04:37.040 --> 04:39.040
for putting something out there.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.400
And then we had to discuss what label to put on it,

04:41.400 --> 04:43.000
and we ended up with, well, let's call it

04:43.040 --> 04:45.520
a participatory economy.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.420
So that was the origins.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.000
Michael and I were very much together on that wavelength

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
and the first books we published about it were back in 1990.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.120
So at this point, it's been around a while.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.360
And after the fall of the wall

05:06.600 --> 05:09.720
and the sort of crumbling of the centrally planned economies

05:09.720 --> 05:11.840
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,

05:11.840 --> 05:16.000
there's now been a 30-year debate

05:16.000 --> 05:18.440
about what should socialists be championing.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.460
And there's various schools of thought.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.580
There's a lot of proposals about market socialism.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.840
There's basically proposals about taking

05:28.840 --> 05:32.540
social democratic capitalism as far as you can take it.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.180
I would call that's Alec Nove.

05:35.660 --> 05:38.320
And then there are other people who have continued to say,

05:38.320 --> 05:40.560
no, we want a lot more planning than that.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.560
Market socialism isn't really what we socialists

05:44.560 --> 05:46.360
should be championing in the future.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.480
We really need to talk seriously about planning

05:49.480 --> 05:51.560
and different forms of planning.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.560
So this proposal is one of the proposals that's out there

05:56.920 --> 06:00.920
that sort of fits into that 30-year debate.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.800
And in that context, it's been argued about

06:03.800 --> 06:06.120
in various journals and at various conferences

06:06.120 --> 06:08.100
over the past 30 years.

06:08.100 --> 06:12.060
And there are some basic principles that inform pericon.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.620
And these are in short, self-governance

06:14.620 --> 06:17.700
through democratic councils of workers and consumers

06:17.700 --> 06:19.460
and their respective federations.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.620
That's the first one.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.780
The second one would be jobs balanced for empowerment,

06:23.780 --> 06:26.460
desirability and caring labor.

06:26.460 --> 06:30.260
The third one would be remuneration according to sacrifice

06:30.260 --> 06:32.660
or effort as judged by coworkers.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.980
And the fourth one would be economic coordination

06:35.980 --> 06:38.980
through a participatory planning procedure.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.860
I would very much like to go through all of them.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.180
Let's start with self-governance.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.700
How would democratic self-governance

06:46.700 --> 06:48.740
be achieved in pericon?

06:48.740 --> 06:50.740
You did a brilliant job of summarizing

06:50.740 --> 06:52.400
the major features of the proposal,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.500
so I don't have to, thank you.

06:54.500 --> 06:59.500
First, we've argued that it's very clear

06:59.940 --> 07:03.660
that it's very important to think very hard

07:03.660 --> 07:07.040
about exactly what you think economic democracy means.

07:09.180 --> 07:12.140
And there's two different views

07:12.140 --> 07:15.260
about what economic democracy means

07:15.260 --> 07:16.900
that are really dominant.

07:16.900 --> 07:20.140
One is, well, it's like politics.

07:20.140 --> 07:24.160
I mean, democratic politics is everybody gets a vote.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.500
Everybody gets a vote and everybody gets the same vote.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.200
How else can you do this?

07:29.200 --> 07:32.220
In economics, there's also this concept

07:32.220 --> 07:33.780
that's been around for a long time

07:33.780 --> 07:36.580
that right-wingers like Milton Friedman

07:36.580 --> 07:38.060
called economic freedom.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.420
And that is, well, I should be free to do

07:42.420 --> 07:46.100
with my person and property whatever I want.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.760
And we want a system that allows people to do that.

07:49.780 --> 07:54.180
And so we have begun, we try to begin the discussion

07:54.180 --> 07:57.420
by pointing out that both of these approaches

07:57.420 --> 08:01.940
to what economic democracy or economic freedom means,

08:01.940 --> 08:06.180
they don't apply in most situations

08:07.340 --> 08:11.180
because particularly when economic decisions are made,

08:11.180 --> 08:15.480
what will happen is any economic decision you look at

08:15.480 --> 08:17.820
will affect some people more than other people.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.380
So one person, one vote works

08:22.380 --> 08:25.940
as a notion of economic democracy in those cases

08:25.940 --> 08:28.320
where everybody is affected more or less equally

08:28.320 --> 08:29.260
by the decision.

08:30.260 --> 08:34.020
And economic freedom works for decisions

08:34.020 --> 08:35.420
that really only affect me.

08:35.420 --> 08:38.900
I mean, what color underwear should I put on today?

08:38.900 --> 08:41.700
So yeah, of course, we want economic freedom

08:41.700 --> 08:43.440
is the right way to make that decision.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.880
I get to decide, nobody gets to tell me that.

08:48.100 --> 08:52.020
On the other hand, most economic decisions

08:52.020 --> 08:54.940
are decisions where some people will be affected,

08:55.900 --> 08:58.140
more than one person will be affected,

08:58.140 --> 09:00.860
but some people will be affected more than others.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.980
So we have begun by saying,

09:02.980 --> 09:05.800
let's be clear what the goal is here.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.280
The goal is we want to design procedures

09:09.280 --> 09:10.860
for making economic decisions

09:10.860 --> 09:14.340
so that people would approximately have influence

09:14.340 --> 09:17.900
over a decision to the degree that they are affected.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.780
And that's sort of, that's our starting point

09:23.780 --> 09:26.340
in terms of how we go about thinking

09:26.340 --> 09:28.780
about what a democratic economy means.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.980
And we call that self-management.

09:30.980 --> 09:33.900
We define self-management as decision-making input

09:33.900 --> 09:36.660
over things to the degree that you're affected.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.580
And in some cases, that means I'll have more

09:38.580 --> 09:40.500
decision-making authority or input

09:40.500 --> 09:41.980
than somebody else does.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.860
And in some cases, it'll mean I have some input,

09:44.860 --> 09:47.500
but I don't have as much input as other people.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.720
And in the particular context of workplaces,

09:50.720 --> 09:55.660
what a workplace produces and what technologies they use

09:55.700 --> 09:59.260
and how they go about organizing their work process,

09:59.260 --> 10:01.560
clearly those decisions affect people

10:01.560 --> 10:04.920
in what we propose to be a worker's council,

10:06.540 --> 10:09.520
far more than they affect all sorts of other people.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.980
But it's not that,

10:10.980 --> 10:14.540
their decisions clearly affect other people as well.

10:14.540 --> 10:18.300
What they decide to produce is going to affect consumers.

10:18.300 --> 10:22.060
And if they use these inputs rather than those inputs,

10:22.060 --> 10:27.060
it means, well, if they use particular parts of land,

10:29.300 --> 10:31.020
if they use a piece of land,

10:31.020 --> 10:33.660
that means somebody else can't use it.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.940
So we start with that.

10:34.940 --> 10:36.680
We start with that.

10:36.680 --> 10:40.620
You mentioned that we also start with sort of a position

10:40.620 --> 10:43.380
about, well, what would be a fair way

10:43.380 --> 10:47.180
to distribute the burdens and benefits of economic activity?

10:47.180 --> 10:50.760
And this is something that's hotly contested

10:50.760 --> 10:53.560
by socialists and has been for,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.560
since socialism first became

10:55.560 --> 10:58.480
some sort of an ideology in a movement.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.320
What is a fair, just how should workers be rewarded?

11:02.320 --> 11:05.260
On what basis should people be rewarded?

11:05.260 --> 11:09.020
And we've argued that when you go through all of that,

11:09.020 --> 11:10.960
and you think it through clearly,

11:10.960 --> 11:13.760
that a desirable economy would be one

11:13.760 --> 11:16.760
in which workers are rewarded according

11:16.760 --> 11:19.260
to the sacrifices they make when they work.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.760
We've also used the word effort.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.980
Sometimes some people, I mean,

11:23.980 --> 11:26.780
I know there are times when I'm working harder.

11:26.780 --> 11:30.100
I know when there are times when I'm working less hard.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.500
And those who work harder

11:32.500 --> 11:34.740
probably deserve more compensation.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.340
And certainly people who work,

11:38.340 --> 11:40.420
who make greater sacrifices than they work.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.540
I mean, neoclassical economists

11:42.540 --> 11:44.380
call it the disutility of labor.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.420
You're working right now,

11:47.420 --> 11:49.500
but your disutility isn't very high.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.140
You're doing something that you find more,

11:52.140 --> 11:54.100
you're doing something you find more or less pleasant.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.680
The coal miner who goes down a shaft

11:57.680 --> 12:01.300
and exposes themselves to coal dust

12:01.300 --> 12:05.860
and is sweating and coming home sore at the end of the day

12:05.860 --> 12:09.900
is making more sacrifices than somebody who,

12:09.900 --> 12:11.420
somebody like you or me is

12:11.420 --> 12:13.840
during most of the time when we're working.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.860
So we just think those things should be taken into account.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.340
Those are legitimate reasons

12:18.340 --> 12:22.140
for why some people should sometimes be compensated

12:22.140 --> 12:23.420
by more than others.

12:23.420 --> 12:27.060
Now, how you go about doing that.

12:27.060 --> 12:29.900
So how you go about arranging for economic decisions

12:29.900 --> 12:31.940
to be made according to this principle

12:31.940 --> 12:35.660
or goal of self-management

12:35.660 --> 12:39.340
and how it is that you arrange for people to be compensated

12:39.340 --> 12:40.820
according to their sacrifice.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.180
Well, but at least we understand

12:43.180 --> 12:45.540
what we're trying to accomplish.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.460
And we were very self-conscious from the very beginning

12:48.460 --> 12:50.820
and coming up with proposals

12:50.820 --> 12:53.520
for how you would actually achieve those goals.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.500
Now, one thing I'll be very honest about,

12:56.500 --> 12:59.780
we did not think about very much back in 1990

12:59.780 --> 13:01.820
was environmental sustainability.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.860
So I will plead guilty

13:05.860 --> 13:08.940
as long as most of my socialist comrades of my age

13:08.940 --> 13:11.460
are willing to plead guilty along with me

13:11.460 --> 13:14.620
because we really should.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.940
Leftists and socialists, I believe,

13:19.940 --> 13:24.300
where Johnny come lately to environmental awareness.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.740
We were just so concerned

13:25.740 --> 13:27.540
with all sorts of other things we cared about.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.360
Oh, economic self-management and economic justice

13:31.360 --> 13:35.220
that we sort of took environmental things for granted.

13:35.220 --> 13:38.320
And in many ways, we're just like everybody else

13:38.320 --> 13:40.700
in terms of being woefully un-woke

13:40.700 --> 13:43.700
on the subject of what was happening with the environment.

13:43.700 --> 13:47.700
But one of the things I'm really proud of is,

13:47.700 --> 13:52.300
and this was, I will give my wife credit for this.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.460
My wife is an environmental economist

13:56.460 --> 14:00.320
and she brought her leftist husband

14:00.320 --> 14:04.040
to awareness about just how negligent

14:04.040 --> 14:05.820
me and my fellow comrades were

14:05.820 --> 14:08.440
in our thinking about environmental issues.

14:08.440 --> 14:12.580
And now I have become, as a professional economist,

14:12.580 --> 14:15.260
I teach political economy, I teach economic theory,

14:15.260 --> 14:16.900
but for more than 20 years,

14:16.900 --> 14:19.760
I've also taught environmental economics.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.700
I can almost prove my point about negligence on the left.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.780
So I taught in an economics department

14:25.780 --> 14:27.460
at American University,

14:27.460 --> 14:31.740
known as sort of a heterodox school of economics,

14:31.740 --> 14:34.580
a PhD program that studied political economy

14:34.580 --> 14:39.000
as well as mainstream economics.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.840
We didn't have a professor, you know,

14:41.840 --> 14:44.680
who was a specialist in environmental economics

14:44.680 --> 14:48.060
for the first 15 years I taught in that program.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.240
And I became an environmental economist

14:52.240 --> 14:53.920
because somebody had raised their hand

14:53.920 --> 14:54.920
and said, who's gonna teach

14:54.920 --> 14:56.560
the environmental economics class?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.920
And I said, you know, okay, so I'll do that.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.760
So that's how I became somebody

15:00.760 --> 15:03.740
who actually learned enough about environmental economics

15:03.740 --> 15:08.740
to realize that you have clearly in the year 2020,

15:09.340 --> 15:13.940
clearly any economy to be desirable

15:13.940 --> 15:17.940
has to be an economy that's designed in ways

15:17.940 --> 15:19.860
that is going to help us protect

15:19.860 --> 15:21.900
and preserve the natural environment

15:23.660 --> 15:25.580
far better than any economic system

15:25.580 --> 15:27.540
that people have used up until now.

15:27.540 --> 15:30.820
So I very self-consciously now add the goal

15:30.820 --> 15:33.060
of environmental sustainability, you know,

15:33.060 --> 15:35.660
to economic democracy and economic justice.

15:36.620 --> 15:40.460
And we will get to the mechanisms

15:40.460 --> 15:43.300
that have been incorporated into Perrican

15:43.300 --> 15:45.980
in order to address this question.

15:45.980 --> 15:50.700
Before we go there, maybe you could like guide the audience

15:50.700 --> 15:53.540
through this basic setup of institutions within Perrican.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.740
So this is sort of a thumbnail sketch

15:55.740 --> 15:59.600
of what the major features of a participatory economy are.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.420
We propose that,

16:03.180 --> 16:06.880
that the first is workers councils.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.300
So we don't have private corporations.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.940
Workplaces are governed by a workers council

16:14.940 --> 16:16.540
where every worker has one vote.

16:16.540 --> 16:20.400
And we can go back to our suggestions or proposals

16:20.400 --> 16:23.320
for how it is that workers councils might want to proceed

16:23.320 --> 16:26.640
in their own process of self-governance.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.960
But we have workers councils.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.020
We also have proposed that consumers,

16:32.820 --> 16:34.540
that consumers be organized

16:34.540 --> 16:37.220
into what we call neighborhood consumer councils.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.620
Because we want to enfranchise consumers

16:42.620 --> 16:45.060
in our planning processes.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.780
And if they act as individuals,

16:46.780 --> 16:50.020
it's very difficult for us to incorporate them

16:50.020 --> 16:51.340
into planning procedures.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.780
But if we simply say

16:53.780 --> 16:58.020
that we organize neighborhood consumption councils

16:58.020 --> 17:00.620
where we're talking about maybe 5,000

17:00.620 --> 17:03.740
or 6,000 families that are living in a neighborhood.

17:03.740 --> 17:07.000
So these are geographically defined neighborhoods.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.940
And we just want the size of the council to be such

17:09.940 --> 17:13.020
that you could reasonably participate

17:13.020 --> 17:15.940
by going to meetings in your neighborhood

17:15.940 --> 17:17.460
consumption council.

17:17.460 --> 17:21.100
So that's another sort of major institutional proposal

17:21.100 --> 17:22.500
that we have.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.500
It's a way, we think it's important

17:24.500 --> 17:28.580
to enfranchise consumers in planning procedures

17:28.620 --> 17:31.420
along with workers in their workplace.

17:31.420 --> 17:34.700
What's probably most innovative about our proposal,

17:34.700 --> 17:39.260
I believe, is that there's two different ways

17:39.260 --> 17:43.180
that people have thought you could integrate

17:43.180 --> 17:44.820
the interrelated activities

17:44.820 --> 17:47.360
of hundreds of thousands of workers councils

17:47.360 --> 17:49.980
and hundreds of thousands of consumer councils.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.180
And one would be simply through the market.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.760
Because consumers have to buy what workers,

17:56.760 --> 18:00.360
consumers have to get what workers councils are producing

18:00.360 --> 18:04.360
and different workers councils have to receive inputs.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.440
So there is a, you have to coordinate all this.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.240
And the two ways that the dominant thinking

18:12.240 --> 18:14.620
about how to coordinate all this is,

18:14.620 --> 18:16.440
well, you either have to coordinate it

18:16.440 --> 18:18.640
through market exchanges,

18:18.640 --> 18:22.460
or you're gonna need some sort of central agency

18:22.460 --> 18:24.640
that gathers all the information

18:25.600 --> 18:28.000
and then puts together a coherent plan

18:28.000 --> 18:29.600
for how all this could work out.

18:30.680 --> 18:35.680
And what we have said is both of those are a disaster

18:35.880 --> 18:40.880
that we now can foreseeably predict sort of some,

18:42.920 --> 18:47.920
at least with the, I mean, hindsight's perfect,

18:47.980 --> 18:52.000
but we have the 20th century of hindsight

18:52.000 --> 18:54.720
to see what happened when socialists tried

18:54.720 --> 18:58.960
to somehow have a central planning agency,

18:58.960 --> 19:01.640
be in charge of this coordinating process.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.560
And it's not a good outcome.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.260
And then the question is, but is there an alternative?

19:07.220 --> 19:11.360
And our answer was, there is an alternative.

19:11.360 --> 19:15.180
And what's I think particularly interesting about it is,

19:15.180 --> 19:20.080
I think the alternative is exactly what early socialists

19:20.120 --> 19:23.160
always thought would go on if you go back

19:23.160 --> 19:26.520
to the late 1900s and early 20th century.

19:26.520 --> 19:30.000
What they always thought was, well, these workers councils,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.720
of course they have, their activities are interrelated.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.840
They're gonna have to plan together

19:36.840 --> 19:38.700
how that interrelation works out.

19:39.720 --> 19:44.720
And so we very self-consciously tried to design procedures

19:46.600 --> 19:49.600
that would essentially take that view

19:49.600 --> 19:51.440
of what it is we're attempting to do.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.880
Is there some way that we could have workers councils

19:55.880 --> 19:58.000
proposing what they wanna do,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.760
consumer councils saying, this is what we wanna consume?

20:01.760 --> 20:04.640
And is there some way that they could make

20:04.640 --> 20:08.160
what I call sort of self-activity proposals

20:08.160 --> 20:13.160
and then discover what the consequences of that are,

20:13.300 --> 20:16.600
and then go back to the drawing board

20:16.600 --> 20:20.440
and revise the proposals and resubmit them

20:20.440 --> 20:24.520
so that we could find a feasible plan in this way.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.800
And we wouldn't have a central planning agency

20:26.800 --> 20:28.440
sitting on top of everybody saying,

20:28.440 --> 20:30.080
well, what you propose doesn't work,

20:30.080 --> 20:31.620
you're gonna have to do this.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.720
And we wouldn't have market forces driving the outcome.

20:40.920 --> 20:41.960
Is there really any reason

20:41.960 --> 20:44.360
that we couldn't do things that way?

20:44.360 --> 20:47.620
So we've worked on it sort of theoretically,

20:49.160 --> 20:52.200
and now we've worked on it with sort of computer simulations

20:52.200 --> 20:54.640
to see whether something that we can prove

20:54.640 --> 20:57.300
under certain assumptions would reach a feasible

20:57.300 --> 21:00.260
and desirable and efficient plan under.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.200
This is what economists do.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.080
We say, well, if you make certain assumptions

21:06.080 --> 21:07.760
about preferences people have,

21:07.760 --> 21:10.360
if you make certain assumptions about technologies

21:10.600 --> 21:15.000
that producers have, then under those assumptions,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.640
you can prove that some procedure

21:16.640 --> 21:19.160
will reach a particular outcome.

21:19.160 --> 21:23.600
And way back in 1990, we essentially said

21:23.600 --> 21:26.440
under far less rigorous assumptions

21:26.440 --> 21:29.800
than you need to prove that a market capitalist economy

21:29.800 --> 21:32.120
will reach an efficient outcome.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.960
We can say this process,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.520
which we think was what early socialists

21:36.680 --> 21:40.760
and most people drawn to socialism always wanted instead.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.640
This process will work out.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.840
This process could, it works in theory.

21:46.980 --> 21:51.460
Now that left the issue of, but is it practical?

21:52.400 --> 21:53.600
And we'll come back to this,

21:53.600 --> 21:56.780
but I mean here to put the issue very, very bluntly.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.960
Well, in theory, if we still have,

22:00.960 --> 22:03.680
if we allow the workers and the consumer neighborhood

22:03.680 --> 22:06.060
consumer councils to keep making proposals

22:06.620 --> 22:09.380
and revising their proposals enough times,

22:09.380 --> 22:11.540
in theory, we'll come to a feasible plan

22:11.540 --> 22:13.100
that we can start the year with.

22:14.380 --> 22:18.180
But what if it takes 1000 revisions?

22:18.180 --> 22:20.560
Well, then it becomes a practical impossibility.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.700
So that question was left aside until,

22:23.700 --> 22:25.060
I mean, the best way to answer it

22:25.060 --> 22:27.960
is to convince some country they wanna try it.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.860
But until that happens, then the only answer is

22:30.860 --> 22:32.960
you try and do some computer simulations

22:32.960 --> 22:33.900
to see what happens.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.580
And we now basically have done that

22:36.100 --> 22:39.020
and we have some, I think some pretty interesting,

22:39.020 --> 22:41.460
at least preliminary reporting

22:41.460 --> 22:43.260
that we can do on that subject.

22:43.260 --> 22:46.300
Besides the workers councils that are self-managed,

22:46.300 --> 22:49.500
the consumer councils that are also sort of self-governing

22:49.500 --> 22:51.880
and participate in the planning procedure,

22:52.860 --> 22:55.220
our specific proposal for how it is

22:55.220 --> 22:59.180
that annual participatory planning can substitute

22:59.180 --> 23:02.700
for a central planning board and markets

23:02.700 --> 23:04.140
as a way to come up with a plan.

23:04.140 --> 23:09.140
I think that's the sort of unique and it is unique.

23:10.260 --> 23:12.100
And I think it's a very central part

23:12.100 --> 23:13.780
of what our overall proposal is.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.540
And maybe just for the audience

23:18.540 --> 23:21.060
in order to give some orientation,

23:21.060 --> 23:24.620
the mechanism that is an essential part

23:24.620 --> 23:27.860
of this participatory planning procedure

23:27.860 --> 23:30.900
that will take up all of this information

23:30.900 --> 23:34.460
and process it in a way in order to provide

23:34.460 --> 23:38.100
some first estimates on how to proceed.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.500
This institution is called the IFB,

23:41.500 --> 23:45.860
the Iteration Facilitation Board, isn't it?

23:45.860 --> 23:50.540
Yes, you know, when you're creating things

23:50.540 --> 23:52.300
and you have to put names on them,

23:53.460 --> 23:58.460
some choices are felicitous and some are less so.

23:58.900 --> 24:03.580
And Michael Albert and I remember we talked for,

24:03.580 --> 24:05.780
I mean, we had long conversations

24:05.780 --> 24:10.780
about what name do we wanna give to this system or proposal?

24:11.280 --> 24:15.260
And I mean, I remember one of the early ones we thought of

24:15.260 --> 24:17.980
was decentralized socialist planning.

24:19.920 --> 24:24.700
And I'm the economist and Michael's the political activist.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.960
So that appealed to me.

24:28.820 --> 24:30.980
And Michael argued in this time,

24:30.980 --> 24:34.220
I mean, we've had various arguments over the decades

24:34.220 --> 24:35.860
and sometimes I think I've been right

24:35.860 --> 24:37.540
and sometimes I think he was right.

24:37.540 --> 24:39.540
And on this one, he was dead right.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.420
He said, you know what?

24:41.420 --> 24:45.940
I mean, we should call it a participatory economy.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.940
If people wanna call it participatory socialism, that's fine.

24:48.940 --> 24:52.020
If people wanna say, well, how does it fit in

24:52.020 --> 24:54.420
to left ideology?

24:54.420 --> 24:57.940
We can say it's libertarian socialism.

24:58.820 --> 25:02.380
In Europe calling something libertarian socialism,

25:02.380 --> 25:05.060
it works because everybody knows what you mean.

25:05.060 --> 25:08.340
In the United States, that's a huge problem

25:08.340 --> 25:12.580
because the only people who call themselves libertarians

25:12.580 --> 25:15.620
in the United States are right-wing libertarians.

25:15.620 --> 25:18.140
So if you say libertarian socialism,

25:18.140 --> 25:21.900
you mostly just confuse people in the United States.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.380
But in any case, we had to come up

25:23.420 --> 25:25.220
with some sort of a name and he was the one

25:25.220 --> 25:27.020
that was just very insistent.

25:27.020 --> 25:31.700
We really decentralized socialist planning, no, no, no.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.900
We should just call it a participatory economy.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.340
I think he was right about that.

25:36.340 --> 25:38.300
The iteration facilitation board

25:38.300 --> 25:40.120
is a very unfortunate name.

25:41.380 --> 25:43.380
And in anarchist circles,

25:43.380 --> 25:48.380
it's also a very hotly contested issue exactly what it is.

25:49.220 --> 25:53.500
So besides the name being unfortunate, it's clunky.

25:55.060 --> 25:58.460
The real issue is, well, what does it do?

25:58.460 --> 26:01.400
And I'll just go straight to the issue here.

26:02.820 --> 26:06.260
Anarchists are suspicious

26:07.800 --> 26:10.100
that it's just a different name

26:10.100 --> 26:12.500
for the central planning bureau,

26:12.500 --> 26:15.160
that it's a central planning bureau in disguise.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.240
You told us you didn't have a central planning bureau.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.400
You told us that this was an alternative

26:23.400 --> 26:24.880
to central planning,

26:24.880 --> 26:27.020
but you really just sort of hoodwinked us.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.160
You gave it a different name,

26:29.160 --> 26:33.320
but it really is doing what central planning bureaus do.

26:35.680 --> 26:40.160
And so I wanna take care of that immediately.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.120
This thing, whatever you call it,

26:43.960 --> 26:45.360
we haven't got a better name yet,

26:45.360 --> 26:47.220
iteration facilitation board.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.920
This is what it does.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.400
At the beginning of the annual planning process,

26:52.400 --> 26:57.160
it announces whatever the current estimates are

26:57.160 --> 27:00.920
of the opportunity costs of using different resources,

27:00.920 --> 27:04.140
the opportunity cost of using different kinds of labor,

27:05.120 --> 27:07.920
the opportunity cost of using machinery,

27:07.920 --> 27:10.340
stocks of machines that we have,

27:10.340 --> 27:14.580
and whatever estimates the current estimates are

27:14.580 --> 27:17.160
of the social cost of producing different things.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.460
So for an economist,

27:19.460 --> 27:23.440
what it does is it announces an initial price vector.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.860
Now in left circles, I don't wanna use the word price

27:27.860 --> 27:30.100
because as soon as you talk about a price,

27:30.100 --> 27:32.400
somebody thinks there's a market.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.460
As a matter of fact, as soon as you talk about a price,

27:34.460 --> 27:37.400
some people don't even wanna talk to you.

27:37.440 --> 27:41.720
On the other hand, as an economist, I can insist,

27:41.720 --> 27:44.220
well, in order to make a sensible proposal

27:44.220 --> 27:47.220
about what our workplace wants to do,

27:47.220 --> 27:50.360
we have to have some idea of what does it cost society

27:50.360 --> 27:53.760
to use different things we're asking permission to use,

27:53.760 --> 27:55.060
different inputs.

27:55.060 --> 27:56.880
And we have to have some sort of idea

27:56.880 --> 28:00.960
of whether or not consumers would rather have shoes

28:01.960 --> 28:03.580
or shirts.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.760
So you can't make a sensible proposal

28:06.760 --> 28:09.480
without some sort of information along those lines.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.560
So this is what the iteration facilitation board does

28:12.560 --> 28:14.480
in our annual planning process.

28:14.480 --> 28:19.480
It announces some initial estimates of what those are.

28:21.620 --> 28:26.460
Now in our simulations for the first year,

28:26.460 --> 28:30.320
we said it's just gonna have to announce something arbitrary.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.980
But in the real world, of course, what it would do is

28:35.980 --> 28:40.740
it would begin, it would have a much better initial estimate

28:40.740 --> 28:43.220
to offer than just an arbitrary answer

28:43.220 --> 28:44.820
to what those things are.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.320
It could take whatever they were from last year

28:47.320 --> 28:49.740
and say, let's start with those.

28:50.580 --> 28:53.580
So in either case, and I can tell you something

28:53.580 --> 28:55.140
about when we did the simulations,

28:55.140 --> 28:57.340
how much difference it makes.

28:57.340 --> 28:58.900
You know, if you start from last year,

28:58.900 --> 29:01.960
take advantage of some information you already have

29:01.960 --> 29:04.420
instead of assuming you have no information.

29:04.420 --> 29:06.620
But anyway, they make the announcement.

29:08.300 --> 29:11.780
At that point, all of the workers councils respond

29:11.780 --> 29:14.860
with what I call a self-activity proposal.

29:14.860 --> 29:17.660
We wanna produce this much of these different outputs

29:17.660 --> 29:20.660
and we want permission to use all these different inputs

29:20.660 --> 29:21.800
in order to do that.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.320
The neighborhood consumer councils submit

29:26.320 --> 29:29.020
on behalf of everybody in the neighborhood.

29:29.020 --> 29:31.520
So the neighborhood consumer council is gonna have

29:31.520 --> 29:35.880
to approve individual consumption requests.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.240
And we can come back to whether or not

29:37.240 --> 29:39.700
that's an intrusive process or not.

29:39.700 --> 29:43.000
But in any case, people don't participate

29:43.000 --> 29:47.240
in annual planning as individual consumers.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.740
It's the neighborhood council that participates.

29:51.740 --> 29:55.640
So it sends in, it says, this is the sum total

29:55.640 --> 29:58.480
of all the approved consumption requests

29:58.480 --> 30:00.640
of the people living in the neighborhood.

30:00.640 --> 30:05.640
And this is the sum total income that all those people have.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.680
And that income can either come,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.160
it's either income because they worked

30:10.160 --> 30:12.440
and their sacrifice effort ratings gave them

30:12.440 --> 30:15.720
that much income or we're gonna, I mean,

30:15.720 --> 30:18.280
obviously you're gonna have social security payments

30:18.280 --> 30:19.880
and disability payments.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.120
You're gonna have need-based payments.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.040
So all that income basically,

30:27.040 --> 30:31.240
and so the consumer council responds to

30:31.240 --> 30:32.960
how much are the consumers,

30:32.960 --> 30:35.880
what's the social cost of making different things?

30:35.880 --> 30:37.720
Responds to that by saying,

30:37.720 --> 30:40.080
here's what the neighborhood consumption council

30:40.080 --> 30:42.760
wants to consume, we've approved,

30:42.760 --> 30:46.720
and here is the total income that we all have.

30:48.320 --> 30:52.200
When those come in, supplies and demands

30:52.200 --> 30:54.140
for everything will not be equal.

30:55.140 --> 30:59.580
So there'll be, when all those proposals come in,

30:59.580 --> 31:02.420
there'll be excess demand for a whole bunch of things,

31:02.420 --> 31:04.100
and there may be excess supply,

31:04.100 --> 31:06.060
offers to supply or availability,

31:06.060 --> 31:08.940
not everything is being used of something.

31:08.940 --> 31:12.380
All the iteration facilitation board does

31:12.380 --> 31:17.100
is adjust its estimates of any price

31:17.100 --> 31:20.580
where there was excess demand, it adjusts the estimate up.

31:21.500 --> 31:25.540
And if it's excess supply, they adjust the estimate down.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.060
That's all they do.

31:27.060 --> 31:30.780
So, I mean, that has been my answer to the anarchists who,

31:30.780 --> 31:34.100
look, given the history of socialism,

31:34.100 --> 31:37.260
it's very sensible to be paranoid

31:37.260 --> 31:40.180
about whether anything called an agency

31:40.180 --> 31:41.900
in charge of a planned economy

31:41.900 --> 31:43.620
is gonna turn into one of those evil

31:43.620 --> 31:45.420
central planning agencies.

31:45.420 --> 31:50.420
So I applaud the fact that somebody really wants to,

31:50.820 --> 31:53.940
that somebody wants to be very careful about that.

31:53.940 --> 31:58.940
On the other hand, my answer is what authority

31:58.980 --> 32:02.420
did this agency exert?

32:02.420 --> 32:04.140
What decisions did they make?

32:05.020 --> 32:08.420
They didn't tell anybody what they had to propose.

32:08.420 --> 32:11.380
They didn't say, your proposal is unaccepted.

32:12.620 --> 32:16.300
They didn't say, well, your proposal doesn't fit

32:16.300 --> 32:17.980
and we need a plan that's feasible,

32:17.980 --> 32:21.460
we're gonna revise your proposal for you.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.460
They don't do any of those things,

32:23.460 --> 32:26.660
which is exactly what central planning agencies did.

32:26.660 --> 32:31.380
All they do is adjust the estimates that they send out

32:31.380 --> 32:34.980
for the next round of revisions and proposals.

32:34.980 --> 32:39.980
They adjust the estimates to give us more accurate,

32:42.060 --> 32:45.620
to basically give us more accurate estimates of social,

32:45.620 --> 32:48.260
of opportunity costs of using things

32:48.260 --> 32:50.260
and the social costs of producing things.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.620
That's all the iteration facilitation board does.

32:53.620 --> 32:57.460
And maybe you could dig a little deeper into the question

32:57.460 --> 32:59.540
of how these indicative prices

32:59.540 --> 33:01.460
are actually being calculated.

33:01.460 --> 33:05.100
You state that they are basically estimates

33:05.100 --> 33:07.180
of opportunity costs and social costs,

33:07.180 --> 33:10.340
but how are these measured in concrete terms

33:10.340 --> 33:14.340
and how does one measure opportunity costs,

33:14.340 --> 33:17.140
which is foregone benefit basically,

33:17.140 --> 33:20.020
for all goods and services if individual benefit

33:20.020 --> 33:24.500
is actually a highly subjective and context specific

33:24.500 --> 33:26.700
and also dynamic value.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.100
And this is all additional to the question

33:29.100 --> 33:31.020
whether or not individual benefit

33:31.020 --> 33:33.540
is really the right measure to begin with.

33:33.540 --> 33:36.660
So I was asking myself how this is being done

33:36.660 --> 33:38.900
in very concrete terms,

33:38.900 --> 33:41.300
maybe also for someone who's not an economist

33:41.300 --> 33:43.980
and doesn't really know about the concept

33:44.620 --> 33:45.700
of opportunity costs.

33:45.700 --> 33:49.540
Okay, I'm gonna smile a little bit

33:49.540 --> 33:50.860
and be a little facetious.

33:50.860 --> 33:55.860
I mean, and so I'm gonna be a little facetious and say,

34:00.860 --> 34:05.860
part of the brilliance is that it happens organically.

34:09.340 --> 34:13.020
So there's two sort of ways you can think about

34:13.020 --> 34:15.580
where do these estimates of opportunity

34:15.580 --> 34:17.780
and social costs come from?

34:17.780 --> 34:19.140
And one way of thinking about it,

34:19.140 --> 34:21.740
which is the common sense way to think about it.

34:21.740 --> 34:23.980
And it's the way most people do think about it.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.460
And I think it's the way that most people approaching

34:26.460 --> 34:30.180
socialism have always thought about it is,

34:30.180 --> 34:32.140
well, somebody would have to sit down

34:33.060 --> 34:35.180
and sort of try and calculate that

34:36.220 --> 34:39.540
and take all sorts of factors into account

34:39.540 --> 34:41.300
as part of their calculation.

34:43.860 --> 34:47.420
And that's not what, that's not how it happens at all.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.580
That's not how it happens at all.

34:51.620 --> 34:55.900
Instead, I told you that the initial estimates

34:55.900 --> 34:57.060
can be arbitrary.

34:58.300 --> 35:01.700
And then I said, we start with initial estimates,

35:03.500 --> 35:06.740
the workers councils and the consumer councils respond,

35:07.820 --> 35:10.540
that gives us some excess demands and excess supplies

35:10.620 --> 35:13.220
that tell us the plan isn't feasible yet.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.780
We know to make the plan feasible,

35:16.780 --> 35:20.540
the way to do it is to increase the estimate of things

35:20.540 --> 35:23.260
that are in excess demand and decrease the estimate

35:23.260 --> 35:25.380
of the things that are in excess supply.

35:26.340 --> 35:30.860
An agency does that, but it's a mechanical thing.

35:30.860 --> 35:35.860
It's not sitting down and trying to actually do some study

35:35.860 --> 35:37.140
that leads to the answer.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.900
Now, and the other reason I'm gonna smile and claim

35:39.900 --> 35:42.540
there's a certain genius at work here was,

35:42.540 --> 35:46.740
is well, but what we proved

35:46.740 --> 35:49.220
and all the economists have had to acknowledge

35:49.220 --> 35:51.780
is that, yeah, you did prove this,

35:51.780 --> 35:53.860
is that under standard assumptions

35:53.860 --> 35:56.180
about what people's preferences are like

35:57.900 --> 36:01.060
and standard assumptions about what technologies are like,

36:01.060 --> 36:04.300
the kinds of standard assumptions every economics has

36:04.300 --> 36:06.980
to make in order to do any theoretical study

36:06.980 --> 36:08.780
of what would happen in case.

36:08.780 --> 36:11.740
Under standard assumptions, actually more lax

36:11.740 --> 36:15.100
and there's some assumptions we don't even have to make

36:16.060 --> 36:19.140
that are made to sort of do this kind of analysis

36:19.140 --> 36:20.340
for a market system,

36:21.900 --> 36:25.900
that this process will lead to two outcomes.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.580
The first outcome is, and this is the one

36:28.580 --> 36:31.540
that I would think is the most important,

36:32.020 --> 36:34.420
and this is the one that I would think

36:34.420 --> 36:36.740
is more important to us is,

36:36.740 --> 36:41.020
the first outcome is it'll lead to a feasible plan

36:41.020 --> 36:44.060
where everything that somebody's counting on,

36:44.060 --> 36:46.700
I've been authorized to do this,

36:46.700 --> 36:48.500
but that means I have to be,

36:48.500 --> 36:52.140
I'm also authorized to receive this in order to do it,

36:52.140 --> 36:54.740
that everybody will be able to actually carry out

36:55.740 --> 36:58.860
the last thing that they proposed.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.700
That's the first thing.

37:00.700 --> 37:04.180
We've demonstrated that you'll get to a feasible plan.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.940
We've also demonstrated that the plan will be efficient.

37:07.940 --> 37:10.540
You won't be misusing resources.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.700
You won't be using a resource to do something

37:13.700 --> 37:15.940
where you're producing something less valuable,

37:15.940 --> 37:17.940
whereas if you'd used it for something else,

37:17.940 --> 37:20.420
it would have produced something that was more valuable.

37:20.420 --> 37:21.820
More valuable to whom?

37:21.820 --> 37:23.780
More valuable to consumers,

37:23.780 --> 37:26.180
given what it is they're telling you they want

37:26.180 --> 37:27.020
and they don't want.

37:27.300 --> 37:32.300
The third thing is that your final estimates

37:32.340 --> 37:34.620
of these opportunity and social costs

37:35.820 --> 37:38.100
will be as accurate as any estimates

37:38.100 --> 37:43.100
of social opportunity and social costs you can expect.

37:43.380 --> 37:47.420
So it's not that non-economists approach this

37:47.420 --> 37:51.820
in a very sensible, straightforward way.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.940
While you're saying that we're not going to be able

37:55.020 --> 37:57.380
to do that, while you're saying that we need

37:57.380 --> 38:00.140
to know the opportunity cost of using a piece of land,

38:01.260 --> 38:02.900
that's probably a hard thing

38:02.900 --> 38:04.580
to figure out what that would be.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.580
And if somebody were sitting down

38:07.580 --> 38:10.700
and trying to calculate it, it would be hard.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.700
Basically, it would be impossible.

38:12.700 --> 38:16.820
But that doesn't mean that certain procedures

38:18.220 --> 38:20.740
will not generate that information.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.260
And that's what's happening.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.300
It's not that somebody's calculating it,

38:25.300 --> 38:28.820
it's that that answer is being generated.

38:30.260 --> 38:32.620
And it's generated by the process I've described

38:32.620 --> 38:35.100
as the annual participatory planning process.

38:36.020 --> 38:41.020
And at some point, there will be a situation

38:41.820 --> 38:46.820
where all of the councils will have to decide up on

38:47.340 --> 38:50.060
whether or not the different proposals

38:50.060 --> 38:52.020
are being accepted or not.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.340
So maybe let's move a step further

38:54.340 --> 38:55.700
within the planning process

38:55.700 --> 38:59.300
so the audience can kind of understand the different steps.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.860
So we reach the point where there will be a feasible plan,

39:02.860 --> 39:03.980
as you call it.

39:03.980 --> 39:08.980
So how are the next procedural steps then?

39:09.140 --> 39:12.500
Yes, if there isn't a central planning agency

39:12.500 --> 39:17.500
that says no, well, then who says no

39:18.900 --> 39:21.700
if a worker council proposes to do some,

39:21.740 --> 39:24.500
they're the only ones allowed to make proposals

39:24.500 --> 39:27.420
and nobody gets to revise their proposals other than them.

39:28.340 --> 39:31.780
So what's gonna prevent a worker council

39:31.780 --> 39:34.580
from doing something that really isn't fair

39:34.580 --> 39:35.620
to the rest of us?

39:37.340 --> 39:39.660
And what's gonna prevent a consumer council

39:40.660 --> 39:43.700
for doing something that isn't fair to the rest of us?

39:43.700 --> 39:45.940
Let's first figure out, well, what would it mean

39:45.940 --> 39:48.780
to do something that isn't fair to the rest of us?

39:48.780 --> 39:52.460
For a worker council, what it comes down to is

39:52.460 --> 39:55.460
you're making a proposal to produce certain outputs,

39:55.460 --> 39:57.860
but you're also proposing that you would be allowed

39:57.860 --> 39:59.340
to use certain inputs.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.940
Well, those inputs have a cost to society

40:02.940 --> 40:05.380
because if you use them, somebody else can't.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.140
And those outputs are presumably

40:07.140 --> 40:08.500
for some other worker council

40:08.500 --> 40:10.100
that finds them more or less valuable

40:10.100 --> 40:12.940
or for consumers who find them more or less valuable.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.620
So there's sort of the social benefits

40:16.620 --> 40:20.540
of all the outputs that you have proposed

40:20.540 --> 40:23.140
and there's the social cost of all the inputs

40:23.140 --> 40:24.660
that you've proposed.

40:25.940 --> 40:28.340
An irresponsible proposal,

40:28.340 --> 40:30.900
I'm gonna call it socially irresponsible.

40:30.900 --> 40:35.020
It would be socially irresponsible for a worker council

40:35.020 --> 40:37.860
to make a proposal where the social benefits

40:37.860 --> 40:40.180
of their outputs aren't at least as large

40:40.180 --> 40:42.700
as the social cost of their inputs.

40:42.700 --> 40:43.660
Because if they do that,

40:43.660 --> 40:45.260
the rest of us are gonna be worse off

40:45.260 --> 40:47.860
if they go ahead and do what they're proposing.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.700
What would it mean for a consumer council

40:51.700 --> 40:53.060
to be irresponsible?

40:53.060 --> 40:57.020
So for a worker's council, the real issue is,

40:57.020 --> 40:59.340
are you gonna contribute more to social benefits

40:59.340 --> 41:01.020
than you do to social costs?

41:03.300 --> 41:06.900
And before I move on, let me point out,

41:08.420 --> 41:09.980
as long as you're not,

41:09.980 --> 41:13.100
as long as the social benefits of your proposal

41:13.140 --> 41:15.220
are at least as large as the social costs,

41:16.140 --> 41:17.780
the rest of us are not any worse off

41:17.780 --> 41:19.100
if you go ahead and do it.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.620
You're not making any of the rest of us worse off.

41:24.540 --> 41:27.700
And so why would we care what you do?

41:27.700 --> 41:29.780
As long as you don't make me,

41:29.780 --> 41:32.780
as long as the rest of us are not made worse off,

41:32.780 --> 41:35.140
go ahead and do whatever the hell you want to.

41:37.020 --> 41:39.100
Now the consumer councils.

41:39.100 --> 41:41.260
So the neighborhood consumer councils are saying,

41:41.260 --> 41:43.020
we wanna consume all this stuff.

41:43.940 --> 41:46.100
Well, it costs society a lot to make all this stuff.

41:48.060 --> 41:50.900
Social responsibility for them amounts

41:50.900 --> 41:55.020
to comparing their aggregate income,

41:56.060 --> 42:01.060
that is their right to consume socially costly goods

42:01.660 --> 42:04.980
and services to the social cost

42:04.980 --> 42:06.500
of their consumption request.

42:07.500 --> 42:12.260
So as long as the income, the sacrifices from work

42:12.300 --> 42:14.580
and the allowances and disability and all,

42:14.580 --> 42:17.500
as long as that is sufficient to pay for

42:18.780 --> 42:20.860
the social costs of a neighborhood

42:20.860 --> 42:22.660
consumption council request,

42:22.660 --> 42:24.220
well then they're not asking for anything

42:24.220 --> 42:25.860
that's not fair for them to have.

42:27.140 --> 42:29.660
If they're asked, if it turns out the social cost

42:29.660 --> 42:32.380
of that neighborhood consumption council request

42:32.380 --> 42:34.780
is greater than their income is,

42:34.780 --> 42:36.140
then they're being greedy.

42:37.220 --> 42:39.580
And the rest of us have every right to say,

42:39.580 --> 42:41.500
no, you can't do that.

42:41.500 --> 42:44.220
Unless you can make some special argument

42:44.220 --> 42:46.500
about why it is this year.

42:48.660 --> 42:51.220
There were a bunch of people who got sick

42:51.220 --> 42:53.300
and they had medical expenses.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.900
Of course, we're gonna have medical expenses free anyway.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.940
But so there are special circumstances that might come in.

42:59.940 --> 43:02.620
So the basic point is,

43:02.620 --> 43:07.580
there is an easy way for everybody to evaluate

43:07.580 --> 43:08.860
first their own proposal.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.300
When you make a proposal,

43:10.300 --> 43:11.540
presumably you'd like to know

43:11.540 --> 43:13.020
if it's socially responsible.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.420
So the only way you know that is to look and see

43:16.420 --> 43:18.780
is our social benefit to social cost ratio

43:18.780 --> 43:21.180
at least one, if not higher.

43:21.180 --> 43:23.660
And then you'd like to know if your consumption proposal

43:23.660 --> 43:26.180
is socially responsible.

43:26.180 --> 43:28.660
And that basically comes down to is the social cost

43:28.660 --> 43:30.980
of what you're asking to consume,

43:30.980 --> 43:34.340
greater than what your income and your fair income

43:34.340 --> 43:37.180
based on sort of efforts and needs and things

43:37.180 --> 43:39.180
and various things that we've worked out.

43:40.700 --> 43:43.380
So you wanna know that about your own proposals,

43:43.380 --> 43:44.740
but there's a way to do it.

43:46.220 --> 43:49.060
We've got these estimates of social costs

43:49.060 --> 43:52.620
and opportunity costs that allow the proposers

43:52.620 --> 43:55.140
to figure out whether their own proposal

43:55.140 --> 43:56.940
is socially responsible.

43:56.940 --> 44:00.060
And importantly, it lets all the other councils

44:00.060 --> 44:03.180
do the same, which is why you don't need

44:03.180 --> 44:04.940
central planners to say no.

44:07.100 --> 44:10.060
We've provided the councils with the information

44:10.860 --> 44:13.100
necessary so that they can self-police

44:16.140 --> 44:20.180
and do it fairly quickly without a lot of,

44:20.180 --> 44:22.340
you know, debate and discussion.

44:24.580 --> 44:29.580
And I think that's the thing that I'm sort of most anxious

44:30.020 --> 44:32.260
to emphasize that aspect of it.

44:34.420 --> 44:38.340
Because I think a large part of the reason

44:38.380 --> 44:41.220
that people are drawn to sort of models

44:41.220 --> 44:45.140
of market socialism is well,

44:45.140 --> 44:47.700
the market takes care of all this for us.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.660
And the only alternative is just going to be

44:49.660 --> 44:51.980
a tremendous amount of arguing.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.900
That's just gonna go on forever.

44:53.900 --> 44:57.380
I mean, one of my colleagues here in the United States,

44:57.380 --> 45:00.300
a socialist feminist economist named Nancy Fulbright.

45:03.020 --> 45:05.860
And early on her reaction to participatory,

45:05.860 --> 45:08.540
you know, the participatory economy proposal was,

45:08.540 --> 45:10.060
Robin, you're a really nice guy.

45:10.060 --> 45:12.020
I understand what you're trying to do here.

45:12.020 --> 45:14.140
We're all in favor of all that,

45:14.140 --> 45:17.940
but this is gonna lead to the dictatorship of the sociable

45:19.940 --> 45:24.220
by which she meant, and as anybody who's been in the,

45:24.220 --> 45:27.420
as anybody has participated in left politics long enough,

45:28.300 --> 45:32.060
you know, one of the nightmares is that the meeting comes,

45:32.060 --> 45:34.300
the meeting is called to order,

45:34.300 --> 45:36.540
probably starts an hour late,

45:36.540 --> 45:39.540
and there's arguing and debating and back and forth.

45:39.540 --> 45:42.140
And we've gone on for two or three or four hours

45:42.140 --> 45:44.540
and sensible people have to go home.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.060
And in the end, the argument goes on and on and on.

45:47.060 --> 45:48.940
And it's whoever was most stubborn

45:48.940 --> 45:50.900
and whoever stayed till two in the morning

45:50.900 --> 45:52.900
who finally ends up deciding things.

45:53.940 --> 45:56.820
And you don't want a system that comes down to that.

45:58.620 --> 46:01.420
And one of the things that I think is very important

46:01.420 --> 46:03.460
about our proposal is,

46:03.460 --> 46:08.460
we think we have made the central planning agency obsolete.

46:09.060 --> 46:10.580
You don't need it.

46:10.580 --> 46:13.980
And yet we have not burdened people

46:13.980 --> 46:17.820
with endless amounts of meeting time and discussion time.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.860
And we haven't put people in a situation

46:19.860 --> 46:22.780
where the only criteria for making the decision

46:22.780 --> 46:25.700
is who was just most stubborn and held out the longest.

46:26.700 --> 46:31.700
That there's sort of objective ways to quickly decide

46:31.980 --> 46:35.980
was that proposal socially responsible or irresponsible.

46:35.980 --> 46:38.020
And as long as it's socially responsible,

46:38.020 --> 46:40.340
whether it's coming from a neighborhood consumption council

46:40.340 --> 46:41.900
or a workplace,

46:41.900 --> 46:44.700
the rest of us should be totally happy to let them do it.

46:46.020 --> 46:48.980
And there's an easy, and we think that this can all,

46:48.980 --> 46:51.100
I mean, we now know from the simulations

46:51.100 --> 46:54.740
that this shouldn't take more than five or six simulations

46:54.740 --> 46:56.180
to come up with an annual plan,

46:56.180 --> 46:58.860
which can easily be done in the month of December.

46:59.940 --> 47:01.940
That's not to say that there won't be

47:01.940 --> 47:03.660
some special circumstances

47:03.660 --> 47:05.700
that need to have further discussion.

47:06.940 --> 47:08.500
And we can talk about that,

47:08.500 --> 47:11.940
but unless you can take care of the bulk of the decisions

47:13.100 --> 47:18.100
in a way that doesn't require a long trial of some sort,

47:18.860 --> 47:23.860
or a tremendously long and long set of meetings,

47:25.500 --> 47:28.900
as long as you're only using those procedures

47:28.900 --> 47:30.940
for a very small number of cases

47:30.940 --> 47:32.900
that really are special circumstances

47:32.900 --> 47:34.300
and deserve special attention,

47:34.300 --> 47:37.380
we think then it's not a practical impossibility.

47:37.380 --> 47:40.340
Maybe as a quick follow-up question,

47:40.340 --> 47:45.340
so I absolutely understand that you have this notion of,

47:47.620 --> 47:50.460
let's call it parametric coordination

47:50.460 --> 47:53.420
that makes all of these processes very much easier

47:53.420 --> 47:55.020
as you just stated,

47:55.020 --> 47:59.260
but within these situations where the councils decide

47:59.260 --> 48:01.020
over the proposals of each other,

48:01.020 --> 48:04.140
and they do have these parametric indicators

48:04.140 --> 48:07.340
that are at the end boiling down

48:07.340 --> 48:10.580
to a ratio of social benefit and social costs,

48:10.580 --> 48:12.260
which makes it easier to decide

48:12.260 --> 48:15.820
whether something is really of social benefit or not.

48:17.500 --> 48:20.500
What would be the mechanisms that allow

48:20.540 --> 48:25.540
for going beyond this kind of parametric decision-making?

48:25.860 --> 48:27.700
Because as you just stated,

48:27.700 --> 48:31.900
there might be situations in which this is not sufficient.

48:31.900 --> 48:35.580
This is not like addressing the specific context

48:35.580 --> 48:37.980
of a given situation,

48:37.980 --> 48:40.740
whether in a council or a workers council

48:40.740 --> 48:43.540
or consumers council for that matter,

48:43.540 --> 48:46.020
it might not be sufficient to address

48:46.020 --> 48:48.180
the complete context of the situation.

48:48.180 --> 48:52.180
So what would be the mechanisms to address things

48:52.180 --> 48:56.300
that go beyond this parametric evaluation?

48:56.300 --> 48:59.140
Yes, but there will be situations

48:59.140 --> 49:03.260
where some sort of special consideration is warranted.

49:03.260 --> 49:04.780
So what might that look like?

49:04.780 --> 49:06.260
Before I answer that,

49:06.260 --> 49:09.220
let me just summarize what it is that any worker council

49:09.220 --> 49:11.860
or neighborhood consumer council has to do or not do.

49:12.820 --> 49:16.820
It has to make its own initial proposal.

49:18.620 --> 49:23.060
It has to revise that proposal, its own proposal.

49:25.100 --> 49:29.700
And it has to revise that proposal maybe five or six times.

49:31.660 --> 49:35.940
It also has to vote thumbs up or thumbs down

49:37.420 --> 49:39.380
on all the other proposals.

49:39.380 --> 49:44.380
Now, ordinarily thumbs up or thumbs down

49:45.340 --> 49:47.620
is just if the other proposal

49:47.620 --> 49:50.940
didn't have a social benefit to social cost ratio

49:50.940 --> 49:54.900
that was at least one, our vote is thumbs down.

49:56.380 --> 49:59.180
So it doesn't take a big thinking process.

49:59.180 --> 50:01.060
So that's all that any worker council

50:01.060 --> 50:03.300
or consumer council has to do for itself

50:03.300 --> 50:04.780
and its own proposals.

50:04.780 --> 50:09.780
And it's when they're voting thumbs up or thumbs down

50:10.540 --> 50:13.500
that they're doing what a central planning agency

50:13.500 --> 50:16.500
would do in a different kind of economy, okay?

50:16.500 --> 50:20.700
But it shouldn't take any time.

50:22.140 --> 50:22.980
Now, what about,

50:25.100 --> 50:26.860
so here would be an example.

50:26.860 --> 50:30.980
We have a worker's council and they've made their proposal

50:30.980 --> 50:34.340
and if their social benefit to social cost ratio

50:34.340 --> 50:37.220
is one or higher, they don't have to make any appeals.

50:37.220 --> 50:38.700
They're gonna be approved.

50:38.700 --> 50:42.140
It's not, it's only 0.9.

50:42.180 --> 50:44.900
So it looks like somehow the social costs

50:44.900 --> 50:47.940
of all the inputs they're using are larger than the social,

50:47.940 --> 50:49.300
but they know that's wrong.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.340
They believe this is wrong.

50:51.340 --> 50:53.580
They believe the numbers lie.

50:54.500 --> 50:57.940
I think we need to set up what I call appeal procedures.

50:58.820 --> 51:01.380
So while the whole plan is being made,

51:01.380 --> 51:05.140
it should be possible for a worker's council to say,

51:05.140 --> 51:08.620
look, we know there's something going on

51:08.620 --> 51:10.260
where the numbers are lying

51:10.260 --> 51:12.820
and our proposal really is socially responsible

51:12.820 --> 51:15.940
and we want the opportunity to explain that to somebody.

51:17.140 --> 51:20.420
And so I think that you need to include that.

51:20.420 --> 51:23.140
I mean, in a real world version of this,

51:23.140 --> 51:25.820
you would have to allow for councils

51:25.820 --> 51:27.740
to do that kind of appealing.

51:27.740 --> 51:31.740
But notice what a successful appeal

51:31.740 --> 51:36.260
isn't going to be presenting a whole long description

51:36.260 --> 51:38.940
of how wonderful they think their workplace is

51:38.940 --> 51:41.300
and how wonderful their ideas are.

51:41.300 --> 51:45.100
No, no, a successful appeal will have to take the form of

51:46.100 --> 51:49.620
the estimates of the social benefits and the social costs

51:49.620 --> 51:52.100
is accurately, inaccurately measuring

51:52.100 --> 51:53.500
something that we're doing.

51:55.900 --> 51:58.900
And I think therefore, appeals,

52:01.820 --> 52:06.020
as long as appeals are a small fraction

52:06.020 --> 52:07.860
of what we have to deal with,

52:07.860 --> 52:11.060
and as long as the appeal procedure

52:11.060 --> 52:13.660
takes a very coherent form,

52:13.660 --> 52:18.660
which is the applicant has to basically make a case

52:19.700 --> 52:22.780
that they're being charged.

52:22.780 --> 52:25.660
I mean, here being an easy example,

52:25.660 --> 52:27.460
there's an opportunity cost

52:27.460 --> 52:29.820
of using a particular kind of machine.

52:29.820 --> 52:32.260
And they can say, well, it's right for most of the machines

52:32.260 --> 52:35.220
of this kind, but ours are dilapidated.

52:36.220 --> 52:39.020
So it looks like we're using things

52:39.020 --> 52:41.580
that have a higher opportunity cost than it does,

52:41.580 --> 52:46.580
because so essentially the appeal process

52:46.660 --> 52:49.980
takes a form of challenging the accuracy

52:49.980 --> 52:54.180
of what's being used to measure in the particular case.

52:55.700 --> 52:58.340
The appeal procedure for a neighborhood consumption council

52:58.340 --> 53:01.220
might also be on the grounds that,

53:01.220 --> 53:03.500
although they could do this out of savings too.

53:03.900 --> 53:07.780
So a neighborhood consumption council could say,

53:07.780 --> 53:08.940
we were hit by a flood.

53:09.980 --> 53:13.820
And sure, we could go ahead and say,

53:13.820 --> 53:16.020
we need a lot of stuff for repairs,

53:16.020 --> 53:17.900
and it comes out of our income,

53:17.900 --> 53:20.380
and we can even go ahead and be approved to borrow,

53:20.380 --> 53:23.140
but we really shouldn't even be charged for this.

53:23.140 --> 53:25.740
I mean, we are victims of the disaster,

53:25.740 --> 53:28.980
and therefore there needs to be an exception in our case

53:28.980 --> 53:30.980
of what it is that we're asking for,

53:30.980 --> 53:33.620
and we shouldn't have to pay for all of that

53:33.620 --> 53:35.500
out of our entire income.

53:35.500 --> 53:36.900
I mean, you could handle that

53:36.900 --> 53:39.580
through disaster relief programs too,

53:39.580 --> 53:44.020
but something that's not a disaster relief program magnitude

53:44.020 --> 53:46.020
that might not qualify for it,

53:46.020 --> 53:47.580
still is something that a neighborhood

53:47.580 --> 53:49.740
consumption council could appeal.

53:49.740 --> 53:54.620
For me, the trick is design a procedure

53:54.620 --> 53:57.660
where it's only a tiny fraction of cases

53:57.660 --> 53:59.780
where you would need appeals,

53:59.780 --> 54:03.380
and then make sure that the appeal process is one

54:03.380 --> 54:08.220
where the appeal process has some grounds for adjudication

54:08.220 --> 54:10.820
that are sort of rational and make sense.

54:10.820 --> 54:13.860
So we do have a feasible plan right now.

54:13.860 --> 54:18.220
This plan has been approved by all of the different councils,

54:18.220 --> 54:21.140
consumer councils and worker councils.

54:21.140 --> 54:26.140
So maybe as an addition that the audience

54:26.220 --> 54:29.860
has not yet have as an information,

54:29.860 --> 54:31.900
the information that the different consumer

54:31.900 --> 54:36.500
and producer councils have provided into the process,

54:36.500 --> 54:39.420
this information is aggregated information.

54:39.420 --> 54:41.340
It's not detailed information.

54:41.340 --> 54:44.540
It's not that every consumer council has proposed

54:44.540 --> 54:47.060
every detail of each good

54:47.060 --> 54:50.260
and provided this information for the process,

54:50.260 --> 54:52.180
but it's aggregated information.

54:52.180 --> 54:56.580
So we are now within our imaginary planning process

54:56.580 --> 55:00.140
at the point where we have a feasible plan.

55:00.140 --> 55:01.580
It has been approved,

55:01.580 --> 55:06.220
but the plan entails more or less broad informations

55:06.220 --> 55:08.660
about what has to be produced.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.780
What are the next steps?

55:10.780 --> 55:14.500
How is this aggregated information transformed

55:14.500 --> 55:18.940
into detailed products by the worker councils?

55:18.940 --> 55:23.940
So on January 1st, we have a feasible,

55:24.220 --> 55:26.540
efficient annual production plan,

55:27.420 --> 55:30.100
but there's two problems.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.500
There's still two problems.

55:32.940 --> 55:37.940
One is at plan says the categories are gonna be categories

55:40.100 --> 55:44.660
such as women's dress shoes.

55:45.660 --> 55:49.780
It's not going to be size such and such.

55:49.780 --> 55:54.100
It's not going to be, I don't remember what I called it,

55:54.100 --> 55:56.260
but I had a funny name for it.

55:56.260 --> 56:01.260
You know, the woman's leather high-heeled shoes

56:01.420 --> 56:03.740
with the yellow toes problem.

56:05.620 --> 56:10.620
So the plan is going to be in terms of sort of

56:11.100 --> 56:14.340
broad categories of goods and services.

56:14.380 --> 56:19.260
And yet you have to produce a particular shoe

56:19.260 --> 56:21.500
that might be a little bit different.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.020
How does that all get worked out during the year?

56:24.020 --> 56:25.380
That's one question.

56:25.380 --> 56:28.780
And another question that's, it's related.

56:28.780 --> 56:30.860
It's a little different, but it's related.

56:30.860 --> 56:35.860
And that is by January 15th,

56:36.060 --> 56:38.580
something we assumed when we made the plan

56:38.580 --> 56:39.980
isn't gonna be true anymore.

56:40.980 --> 56:45.980
So there's both the, how do you translate

56:46.540 --> 56:51.540
broad categories of goods into detailed categories of goods,

56:51.900 --> 56:56.100
and how do you adjust for things that happen

56:56.100 --> 56:59.140
that were not foreseen when the plan was drawn up?

57:00.620 --> 57:05.620
And here's where the conversation has been very difficult

57:07.460 --> 57:08.940
amongst leftists.

57:08.940 --> 57:11.940
And I'll give you two examples.

57:11.940 --> 57:16.940
The Jacobin dismissed the whole idea

57:17.020 --> 57:22.020
of a participatory economy entirely on the grounds

57:22.020 --> 57:26.020
that obviously planning, you know, for an economy

57:26.020 --> 57:30.020
that has, they use the example on Amazon alone,

57:30.020 --> 57:33.700
there's so many millions of different goods.

57:33.700 --> 57:37.020
So how could you have a broad category of goods

57:38.020 --> 57:40.900
so how could you ever plan for how much

57:40.900 --> 57:42.220
of those millions of goods?

57:42.220 --> 57:43.700
And that's just Amazon alone.

57:45.260 --> 57:48.980
David Schweikert, who is a proponent of market socialism,

57:48.980 --> 57:52.220
where he says, well, markets can handle this, but you can't.

57:53.860 --> 57:56.580
Basically said, well, the whole thing is very interesting.

57:56.580 --> 57:58.460
This idea of a participatory economy,

57:58.460 --> 58:00.100
but it's just nonsense on stilts

58:00.100 --> 58:01.820
because it can't handle this.

58:02.140 --> 58:07.140
It's been 30 years now since there were any planned economies.

58:08.500 --> 58:10.580
Now there's still a planned economy in Cuba.

58:10.580 --> 58:12.340
I don't know what they have in North Korea,

58:12.340 --> 58:14.620
but I think it's a planned economy.

58:14.620 --> 58:18.060
So, but nobody knows anything about them anymore.

58:18.060 --> 58:20.980
So in popular consciousness,

58:20.980 --> 58:24.980
there's no memory anymore apparently that, you know,

58:24.980 --> 58:29.060
the Soviet economy did actually manage, you know,

58:29.260 --> 58:33.220
to plod along for, you know, going on 50 years

58:33.220 --> 58:34.260
in the Eastern Europe.

58:35.380 --> 58:37.420
And as anybody should now realize,

58:37.420 --> 58:40.020
I'm not a proponent of that system,

58:40.020 --> 58:43.420
but the whole notion that comprehensive planning

58:43.420 --> 58:48.420
is just a practical impossibility is belied by the fact that,

58:48.420 --> 58:51.700
well, it obviously wasn't a practical impossibility.

58:51.700 --> 58:54.620
It might've been a very undesirable way to do things,

58:54.620 --> 58:56.620
but it wasn't a practical impossibility

58:57.060 --> 58:59.900
There must be some way to translate, you know,

58:59.900 --> 59:03.900
from broader categories to more refined categories.

59:03.900 --> 59:06.500
And there must be some way to make adjustments

59:06.500 --> 59:07.340
during the year,

59:07.340 --> 59:08.860
because there were a whole bunch of economies

59:08.860 --> 59:12.020
that managed to do that for decades and decades.

59:12.020 --> 59:14.420
Not to say they did it well,

59:15.420 --> 59:17.540
and not to say that it wasn't,

59:17.540 --> 59:20.820
and that some of the sort of obvious problems

59:20.820 --> 59:22.580
that those economies had,

59:22.780 --> 59:24.900
which, I mean, the major problem

59:24.900 --> 59:27.620
that the centrally planned economies was that,

59:27.620 --> 59:28.780
I mean, one major problem

59:28.780 --> 59:31.180
was they really disenfranchised consumers.

59:32.180 --> 59:34.260
So everybody's aware of the, oh yeah,

59:34.260 --> 59:37.620
I mean, in the Soviet Union, you know, you could get shoes,

59:37.620 --> 59:39.740
but everybody's shoes all look the same.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.100
Well, by the end of the Soviet Union,

59:42.100 --> 59:43.580
that wasn't really true.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.860
On the other hand, the variety that capitalists

59:46.860 --> 59:49.340
and market systems had to deal with,

59:49.340 --> 59:51.940
the variety that capitalists

59:51.940 --> 59:54.300
and market systems had to offer,

59:54.300 --> 59:56.660
I don't think that variety was ever offered

59:56.660 --> 59:58.460
by any centrally planned economy.

59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.220
So it's a reasonable idea that maybe planned economies

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.220
are not as nimble in these regards.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.540
But that's what it comes down to.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.660
It's not like it's a practical impossibility.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:11.940
We know that's the case.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.220
Well, here's how you would translate.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.340
So you have a plan,

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.420
you're a workers council and you're making shoes.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.620
And you have a plan that's approved to you,

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.060
you know, that's been approved for you

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.780
to make certain amounts of shoes, you know, for adult women.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.700
And you go ahead and make them.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.420
And they get shipped to the distribution centers

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.380
and people start picking them up.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:40.860
And it turns out that the red ones are going like hotcakes

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.380
and the yellow ones are just sitting on the shelf.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.140
Well, you do just exactly

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.620
what any capitalist shoe making business does.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.260
You know, you shift over

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.460
and you start making more of the red ones

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.620
and you make fewer of the yellow ones.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.580
So in terms of detail,

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.260
it works out in a planned economy,

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.220
just the way, there's no reason it can't work out

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.540
in a planned economy that is sensitive

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.500
to what the consumers want.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.140
Now, I mean, this is an interesting question.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.780
And I do think that one of the things

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.780
that capitalism has done has disempowered consumers

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:28.060
relative to producers in all sorts of important ways.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.460
So what it's gonna come down to is,

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.300
so I'm shipping shoes,

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.420
but the shoes I'm shipping aren't being picked up.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.420
What if I don't change?

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.060
What if I continue to ship the yellow shoes

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:47.020
when the red ones are going like hotcakes?

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.820
Well, then the issue is, well, do I get credit for that?

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.300
And another issue is,

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.460
and this is sort of relevant to sort of empowering consumers.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.620
One of the problems consumers face in market systems is

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.620
you didn't get something that you thought you were getting.

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.860
Now, of course, every capitalist business

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.220
mouths the slogan, the consumer is always right.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.020
But it's totally insincere.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.500
I mean, what they mean is,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.660
we're gonna tell you you're always right,

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:27.500
but we're gonna make sure that we don't have

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.980
to exchange your product unless we absolutely have to,

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.020
and we're gonna make it as difficult as possible for you.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:39.620
So, I mean, one of the things we've suggested is,

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.380
wouldn't it be nice if as a consumer,

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.940
something you get delivered isn't what you expected.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.540
Instead of you fighting with the workers council

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.380
that produced that and delivered that,

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.660
you just turn it back over to your consumer federation,

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.620
say, it's unacceptable,

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.940
and let your consumer federation battle

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.980
in a much more powerful position with the workers council

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.220
and its federation about whether or not this was up to specs.

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:14.220
So my answer is, there are answers to these problems.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.260
The popular consciousness,

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.940
we now have 30 years when none of these economies

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.700
that were comprehensively planned have existed.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.140
And so people are having a hard time imagining

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.740
how it's even possible.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.540
There's an analogy to this.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.420
Before Adam Smith came along,

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:41.340
popular consciousness was, how could it possibly work?

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.980
How could a market system possibly work?

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.900
I mean, how will the producers know

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.180
what the consumers want?

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:58.020
So, I mean, feudalism made economic decisions

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.060
in a certain way, and Adam Smith was saying,

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.380
we don't need to make economic decisions that way at all.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.380
We can just leave, we can have individual producers

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.580
and individual consumers out there,

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.060
and as long as they can buy and sell

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.700
from one another in a market, it's all gonna work out.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.340
And there was a time in history

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.860
where people just had a hard time imagining that.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.500
And he became famous for saying,

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.620
see, something you can't even imagine

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.940
is actually readily possible.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.420
And I think we're back in a similar situation

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.940
where we're arguing

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.900
that you can do comprehensive planning.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.820
It's not a practical impossibility,

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.140
but for 30 years, nobody has seen it

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.380
and everybody just can't imagine it anymore.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.300
But I think we've got perfectly sensible answers

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.540
for how the more broad categories

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.220
get translated into more refined categories.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.220
It's simply, when it's delivered,

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.100
some things will be picked up and purchased

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.900
and some things won't,

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.100
and you do sensible adjustments

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.700
when that turns out to be the case.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:08.220
That means you're gonna have to order more red dye

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.980
and less yellow dye, and then that's an adjustment

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.980
that's gonna have to be made too.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.420
My answer to the doubting Thomas's is,

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.060
that's not rocket science.

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.900
Do you really wanna argue about that?

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:25.700
I mean, maybe as an addition, you used the term

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.460
that the producers will need to be sensitive

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.300
to what people actually consume.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.060
One might add that, I mean,

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:39.060
there are sensors proliferating throughout the world today,

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.660
and we have digital technologies,

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.260
information and communication technologies

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:49.260
that are very much able to sense much more

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.900
than was able before.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:56.500
So this might also be a factor that comes into play.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.980
That's something that is out there

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.700
in popular consciousness, and I think it's good,

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:04.340
which is that technologies have changed a lot

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:10.500
in terms of just supply-side management technologies

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.620
have changed a lot.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:16.420
And the ability, I mean, I buy all my books,

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.340
I probably shouldn't admit to this

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.260
because I'm obviously not supporting

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.100
my local leftist bookstore.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:27.940
But when I can buy a digital version

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.420
of a book I want on Amazon and get it on my Kindle

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.100
in literally five seconds, yes, I do that.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.660
So there's been changes in technology

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.220
that basically make all of this adjustment stuff

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.620
a lot easier than it would have been 40 years ago.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.900
But I wanna point out,

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.300
so I think that the things we're talking about

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.940
in terms of how speedy and efficient

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.420
can the detail and adjustment process be

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:08.180
given today's technologies as compared to 40 years ago,

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.580
actually a lot better.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.100
But I don't wanna concede the point

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.980
that we could have still had this kind of economy

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.020
40 years ago.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.460
It just wouldn't have been quite as quick and efficient

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.700
about making the adjustments,

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.060
but it would have been fine 40 years ago too.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.100
It wasn't like the new,

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.460
we didn't have to wait for these new technologies.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.140
And there's a similar,

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.900
sort of the socialist calculation debate

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.260
had a similar issue,

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:38.180
which was the original objection

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:43.180
to socialist economies that came from the Austrians

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.580
was, well, it's just too many equations.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.900
You could never solve all the,

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.700
they were imagining central planning

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.540
and they were saying,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.860
there's no way you could possibly solve all those equations.

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.740
And that's the beauty of the market system.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.780
You don't need a huge computer.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.620
And they were right that in 1900

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:10.380
when the debate was going on was like pre-World War I

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.660
and sort of post-World War I.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:17.660
They were right that we didn't have powerful computers.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:23.020
And people like Paul Cotshot and Alan Cottrell,

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:23.900
they've made the point,

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.260
but now we do have these computers.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.580
So we could calculate a very, very detailed,

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.260
large central plan.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:35.220
And my answer is, yes, we could now and we couldn't then,

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.820
but we still don't want to, but for different reasons,

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.660
just because we can do it doesn't mean we want to do it.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.700
But in this case, yeah,

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.300
of course we would want to use all that new technology

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.100
to make the adjustment process.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.700
You want to adjust for details,

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.260
you want to adjust for unseen events.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.820
And if we've got new technologies

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.220
that would make all that easier and more efficient,

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.740
of course that makes the whole thing work better.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:00.060
We should be very happy about that.

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.620
So now we have actually transformed

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.700
these aggregated information

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.100
into aggregated pieces for production,

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.300
inputs for production,

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.420
and they have been transformed into detailed products

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.380
by the workers councils.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:22.380
And from there on, people will go to stores

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.180
just like they do nowadays

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.500
and will purchase these items,

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.180
depending on how much credit, so to speak,

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.700
they have coming from their work

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.060
within each workers council.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.980
So I'm a consumer

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:44.140
and I had an annual consumption proposal

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.380
that's been pre-approved.

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:51.260
And so now, and I want to admit to something personally,

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.700
I don't shop.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.900
There's only one thing I shop for,

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.420
I'm the cook in my family.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.500
So I shop for, I go to food stores.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500
So I shop in food stores,

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.820
which is why I know how people shop,

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.700
because I don't think I've ever bought a piece of clothing

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.540
I've ever worn.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.940
So I shop for books and I shop for food.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.820
When I shop for, and when I shop for food,

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.620
I'm a bargain hunter.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.100
So that's why I know when I go up and down the aisles,

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.780
I'm looking to see what the price tag on that thing is today.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.860
And if it's not a sale price tag,

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.100
I'm gonna probably pass it up

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.980
and hope for something better tomorrow.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.180
So that's why I know that when people shop,

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.500
you show them price signals and that's how they respond.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.060
But the whole idea of sort of shopping

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.380
is really foreign to me.

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.900
And I had a group of students

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.100
who came into my office one day

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.060
and they said, well, we're in your class

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.820
and you've been talking about this participatory economy.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.780
But there's just one thing that

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.860
we either don't understand or we don't like about it.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.900
And what they said was,

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:10.180
you don't really understand the pleasures of mauling it.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.300
And I thought they were saying maul, M-A-U-L.

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.860
And then it turned out, no, no,

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.780
they meant the pleasures of going to the shopping mall,

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.620
seeing and being seen and just deciding on the spot,

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.340
what do you wanna buy or not buy?

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.820
And I told them, I said, you're absolutely right.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.700
Your dream is my nightmare,

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:40.580
being caught in a shopping mall for more than five minutes

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.500
it would be a death sentence as far as I'm concerned.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.580
It's the last thing I'd ever wanna do.

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:50.580
But I understand, you have a reasonable demand here.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.940
And so that is a question of how do you accommodate that?

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.780
And so the whole idea, I never thought about

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.580
how the goods are actually being picked up and distributed.

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.740
I just thought of people as,

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.620
well, you're going to your local food store

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.300
and that's how you get the food

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.060
that you're gonna go home and cook.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.340
But there's no reason that you can't have shopping malls.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.220
I remember at one point in time,

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.380
and I think it's still true in Cuba,

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.380
they used to do, they did these big displays.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.740
They wanted to show people in Cuba,

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.460
what new kinds of goods might become soon available

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.340
that they hadn't been seeing for a while.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.420
And so they would do these sort of demos.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.700
And they would put on sort of like a fair

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:45.700
where the economic ministry was basically saying,

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.780
basically saying, come out to think

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.200
like a shopping mall thing,

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.820
we're gonna show you new products

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.780
so you're gonna see the kinds of things.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.860
There's no reason that we can't,

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.140
those would all be good ideas.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:02.100
But essentially my vision always was certain items

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.180
would get distributed to distribution centers,

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.540
which really are only for one neighborhood.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.660
Other items is probably gonna have to cover

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.500
four or five neighborhoods,

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.300
the kinds of goods that get sent there to be distributed.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.860
But I always envisioned is you're picking it up,

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.820
you've got your swipe card.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.600
At some point along the line,

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.380
your swipe card starts to tell you

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.140
that you're actually picking up more of certain things

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.220
than that you had ordered.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.620
Do you wanna make an adjustment

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.820
or is this just something that you're gonna make up for?

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.060
That's where the new technology really is,

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.660
really should help in making the adjustments.

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.980
But that's the kind of process that I think

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.680
from the point of view of a non-shopper,

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.880
that's about the best I can say.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.440
Yeah, and I think it's quite important for many people

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.240
that there is some form of flexibility still

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.680
and that you do not,

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:59.680
that you're not hold to buying exactly the things

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.700
that you were thinking of at the beginning of the year,

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.740
but this could be done in a fashion where,

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:11.740
I don't know, if you achieve an amount of like 80 to 90%

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.880
of things that you already knew

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.440
that you will consume, this is very good.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.240
And then if there rests 10 or 20% of goods

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.760
that you consume over the year

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.600
are those that are being consumed in a more dynamic

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.540
and flexible and spontaneous way,

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.480
then this is still an improvement, I guess.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.360
So this doesn't have to be an either or situation.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.500
I would concur, that's the way I think about it too.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.720
There are two issues.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.840
I mean, one is easy to take care of.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.760
What if somebody during a year ends up

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.720
consuming less than they were,

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.320
I mean, the sum total social cost of what they consume

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.960
is less what they're approved for.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.800
Well, that's easy.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.120
Then it just goes into,

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.560
it adds to their savings and the savings account.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.360
Now, what about somebody who ends up consuming more

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.880
than they were approved for during the year?

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.980
Well, in that case, they're basically borrowing.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.880
And it's some, I mean, I don't think you ever have

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.120
to sit in judgment over us.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.720
If somebody wants to save,

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.240
who the hell is ever gonna say no?

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.000
If somebody wants to borrow,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.160
and oh, but you're borrowing every year

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.240
and you've been borrowing every year for 15 years

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.080
and it's kind of becoming clear

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.780
that you aren't really planning

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.320
or whether you're planning to pay it back

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.360
or you're just, you think you're planning to play it back

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.320
but it's becoming rather obvious to the rest of us

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.280
that you can't, somebody has to sit in judgment over this.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.640
One of my daughters works for credit unions

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.800
and basically has, one of her jobs is

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.360
people taking out new car loans to buy new cars.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.040
And so she's constantly watching cases where,

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.120
yeah, you thought you had a credible plan

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.080
about your payments, but in fact, you don't.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.040
So I think of it more as you're still gonna have

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.340
something like credit unions

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:07.920
and a credit union is going to have to sort of,

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.240
they're gonna have to monitor

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.240
whether borrowing has become insincere.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.160
But there's total flexibility about saving and borrowing

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.400
in terms of the grand sum total of what you're spending

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.420
in a year being different from what you proposed.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:30.280
There's really no problem in handling that.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.800
The difficulty is for particular items.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:38.800
So if certain things, for a certain item,

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.320
the grand total amount that consumers

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.960
are taking off the shelves

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.640
is greater than what was planned for,

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.200
then we have a decision to make,

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200
well, who's gonna get it and who isn't?

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.280
And there you would have a complicated,

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.000
I mean, there I think you have a somewhat complicated issue.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.960
Well, I had it in my order

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.000
and so should I have priority over somebody

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.060
who didn't have it in their order.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.360
And there's another issue about,

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.300
well, do we just also take care of this

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.740
by adjusting the price?

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.680
And in the latest book I wrote,

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.360
I sort of discussed these very,

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.500
what are the pros and cons of handling these situations

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.380
which will inevitably arise one way or another?

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.480
And I think there are some pros and cons

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.080
of handling it one way or another

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.400
and there are issues that will arise.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.080
I mean, like from the tip of my head,

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.760
I would say like you could easily reserve some item

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.160
for a period of time

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.600
and if it's not consumed during this time period,

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.880
it will be free to consume for anybody else

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.040
who's interested in the item.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.060
And then additionally, this question of pricing

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.880
comes into play, but that's just a side note.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.040
There is a complimentary aspect

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.580
to this question of consumer flexibility

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.780
and that is the question of flexibility

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.120
on the side of producers

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.480
because another thing that the Austrians brought forward

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.240
and you mentioned them already

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.920
in the context of the socialist calculation debate,

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.180
another thing that the Austrians brought forward

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.180
is this question of competition as a discovery mechanism

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:30.920
and the question of how does innovation come into being,

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.360
into the world, into how is this idea

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:38.400
of the new being handled within an economic system?

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.400
So how would Perkin go about this process of innovation?

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:48.820
How is it being decided whether or not resources

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.440
can be allocated sensibly into a direction

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.720
which might not be like fully developed

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.540
where the odds are not clear

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.660
whether or not something might succeed or not.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:07.260
So how is all of this being decided upon?

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.700
Yeah, by the way, the, I mean, the tooth,

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.180
that the whole Austrian school and the Austrian debate

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.940
in the popular consciousness in the United States,

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.740
it's quite different than in Europe.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.220
In Europe, you all know the Austrian school,

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:26.300
you all know von Mises, you all know Hayek

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.140
and then you know the names of a few other people

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:28.980
who I don't.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.420
In the United States, the only name we know in this regard

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:34.180
is somebody named Milton Friedman

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.660
who was not part of the Austrian school,

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.220
but who sort of,

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.460
he took their arguments,

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:51.460
dumbed them down, also screwed them up to a great extent

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.900
and basically that became sort of what his popular

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.220
consciousness about the impossibility of socialism

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.040
being sensible to a US audience.

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.700
So I just wanted to throw that out there in terms of,

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.300
there are certain subjects where,

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:13.100
I mean, it's the same as social democracy.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.220
You all know what that means in the United States,

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.720
nobody knows what that means.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.540
It's the same as libertarian socialism,

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.860
you all know what that means and in the United States,

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.660
it means something very different.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.260
But anyway, to your question about innovation

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:32.100
and I think this is a very legitimate concern.

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:35.300
I think the conclusion

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.740
that the centrally planned socialist economies

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.720
were deficient in terms of their ability to generate

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.440
sort of innovative economic activities.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.600
I think it's well taken.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.640
And so when I study those systems to try and figure out,

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.480
well, what was it about their incentives?

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.320
What was it about their decision-making and reward systems

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.360
that led to such poor performance in this regard?

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.960
I think there was poor performance

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.400
and there have to be reasons for it

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.520
and it's important to understand what they were.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.420
And so I spent a decent amount of time

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.600
studying the logic of central planning

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.800
and seeing why it would not be in the interest

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.160
of enterprise managers to innovate.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.720
Why would they disguise their capabilities

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.720
rather than sort of try and stretch to?

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.080
Now, the first thing I would point out is

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.880
think of a worker's council in a participatory economy.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.000
Anything they can do,

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.280
any innovation they could introduce

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.940
that would increase their social benefits

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.520
of what they're providing

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.440
or decrease the social costs of what they're using

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.240
is gonna rebound to their benefit

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.460
because it's gonna make it easier

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.840
to get their proposals accepted.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.940
So if an enterprise could come up,

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.020
broadly speaking, there's two kinds of innovation.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.920
One is anything that cuts down the costs

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.920
of what we're making

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.240
or anything that increases the sort of quality

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.240
and the quantity of what we're producing.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.440
So we certainly have incentives

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.520
for workers councils to be searching for all those things.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.640
Here is where there's a real dilemma though.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:36.880
What if a worker's council comes up with a new innovation

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.960
that reduces its social costs

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.880
or increases its social benefits?

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.520
And any economy faces this dilemma.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.120
So we have one unit that came up with the innovation.

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.200
It's very inefficient if the innovation

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.600
doesn't get immediately used

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.000
by all the other worker councils in the industry.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.360
I mean, to have one council in the industry

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.440
doing something that's more efficient

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.980
and the rest of them aren't allowed to,

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.800
well, that seems silly.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.400
And yet that's what patents do.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.160
That's essentially what a patent does.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.140
Now, maybe not forever,

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.480
maybe the patent only lasts for 20 years.

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.300
And once you have the patent,

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.840
you could sort of negotiate with other firms in the industry

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.600
and you could negotiate a price

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.240
and also allow them to use the patent for a certain payment.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.720
But essentially what patents do

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.400
is they slow down the spread of innovation.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.320
Oh, but they also provide a tremendous incentive to innovate

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.380
and that's the argument in favor of patents.

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:56.380
So my first observation is you really cannot have,

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.880
it seems like you can't have your cake and eat it too.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.820
If you want what economists call static efficiency,

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.520
you want everybody to use the innovation

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.720
as quickly as possible.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.520
But if you want quote unquote dynamic efficiency,

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.360
incentive to search for the innovation,

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.520
then you have to prevent it spread.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.080
So it seems like there's a trade-off

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.960
between these two goals.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:25.120
Well, we've taken one extreme position on this,

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.320
which is any innovation immediately

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.000
becomes available to everybody else.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.120
So we're gonna spread immediately.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.600
Does that diminish the incentive

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.000
for an enterprise, for a workers council

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.600
to look for innovations

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.960
because they basically can't sort of hoard it?

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.280
And I think maybe it does.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.440
I mean, I think we have to honestly say, well, okay,

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:57.320
let's consider the consequence of immediately saying

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.700
all innovations are open to anybody.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.360
And then the question is, well, what can you do?

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.880
And my answer is there's still two things you can do.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.240
One is if you actually take a look at research,

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.920
a lot of innovative research in the United States,

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.840
in the United States,

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.960
there's sort of famous studies about innovation.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.040
And what they've discovered is

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.880
the federal government of the United States

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.880
has paid for so much more innovation than anybody realizes.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.080
Everybody thinks it's that creative entrepreneur out there

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080
who did the innovation.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.480
You'd be amazing how much your tax dollars

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.720
paid for innovation.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.560
You'd be amazing at how much innovation

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.760
your tax dollars paid in the US military,

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.120
that became important innovation throughout the economy.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.640
So there's another way to stimulate innovation,

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.880
which is basically just to pay for it.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.640
So why shouldn't we have industry federations

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.640
with very large research institutes attached and budgets?

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.280
And why just have industry federations with that?

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.080
A lot of the innovations have to do with new products

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.920
from a consumer's point of view.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.400
Let's have the consumer federations

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.120
also have very large research institutes

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.960
that are associated with them.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.040
And then any research that those federations

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.640
manage to come up with, innovations that they...

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.520
Well, then of course, those federations...

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.560
It immediately goes to all the enterprises in the federation

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.600
because that's who the members of the federation are.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.240
So that's one way.

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.040
And the other way is, and I've said this,

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.600
I think it would be very important

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.360
for a participatory economy to keep very close tabs

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.520
on whether they think that the economy

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.600
is sort of lacking for innovation.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.920
And despite the fact

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.680
that they've got these big research institutes,

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:18.120
and despite the fact that if you can come up with a way

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.960
to improve your social benefit to social cost ratio,

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.560
it's to your advantage,

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:26.520
but everybody else is gonna get to use it right away too.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.720
So if that proves to be a problem,

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.120
is there something we could still do?

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.560
And I think there is.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.760
You simply grant prizes for innovation

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.480
to individual worker councils.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.160
So if you need to dangle a sort of material benefit out there

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.720
for individual worker council innovation,

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.480
there's no reason you can't do it.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.680
I would argue you're doing it at the expense of fairness.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.400
I mean, it depends.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.760
If you think that innovation is the result of extra effort,

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.280
then in some sense, it's not even at the expense

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.680
of economic justice if you're paying bonuses

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.720
for innovations coming from enterprise.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.960
On the other hand, if you think that innovation

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.120
is largely not a result of that,

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:21.120
it's sort of luck and innovations are basically,

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.560
what they really are is it's a whole sort of process

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:29.480
through time that takes place.

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.200
And it's hard to say any particular person

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.480
was responsible for this whole thing.

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.160
And then I think that would simply

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.560
have to be a decision-making.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.360
If the people in the economy felt

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.880
we're not being innovative enough,

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.800
we need to do something further,

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.000
then there's something you could do.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.080
I would just quite, I think it's important

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.000
to always be honest about what you're doing,

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.680
at least with yourself.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.320
And in this case, I think that what you might do is say,

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.160
we're worried about innovation,

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.960
we're putting a priority on it,

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.760
and we recognize that to some extent,

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.400
it might be at the expense of sort of economic justice.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.320
I think there are plenty of ways to go about this.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.240
And some of those you sketched,

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.920
I would definitely totally agree with.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.080
And I think that additionally,

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.840
there might be some type of kind of crowdfunding.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.560
There might be some budgets that are explicitly put away

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.640
for like some wildcard kind of stuff

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.880
where people that have an idea, an initial idea,

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.640
and that like carry some form of risk

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.000
in the form of resources that are needed

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.240
and that are not already like covered

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.960
in some way, shape or form,

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.320
that might apply for this kind of funding

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.280
and that is specifically put away

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.280
for like wildcard innovation or something like that.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:00.800
Crowdfunding is very popular in the younger generation

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.360
and it's a pretty big deal.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.200
There's a lot of it that goes on.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:08.880
The crowdfunding that I am most impressed by

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.880
is that in our elections in the United States,

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:18.560
Republican candidates traditionally always get,

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.280
are much more adequately funded

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.440
than Democratic party candidates

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.720
because they're getting the big corporations

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.480
and the wealthy contributions.

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.640
And we basically don't prohibit that.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.160
We don't say there are limits

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.040
or it's easy to get around the limits.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.960
But one of the things that's happened basically

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.640
with the Bernie Sanders campaign

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.640
is that small donation funding for progressive candidates

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.080
has proved to be,

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.400
partly it's because of the rise of the internet too,

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.240
has proved to be remarkably,

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:02.240
it's even the money spending field

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.920
in a lot of races in the United States over recently.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.120
And I know, and there's all sorts

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.800
of socially worthy projects and business ideas

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:15.200
that have successfully fundraised in this way.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.400
So there's actually been a debate about

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.640
whether this would be a good idea or a bad idea

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.400
or what the pros and cons of it are on equity grounds

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.040
on the participatoryeconomy.org website.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.560
Because there's a lot of people

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.160
that are interested in this.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.160
Sometimes crowdfunding basically allows the person

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:46.080
who has donated to get a share of whatever comes out of it.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.200
So there's two kinds of crowdfunding.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.480
One is it's basically, it's just a donation.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.840
And the other is, no, you're actually,

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.960
in some sense, you're buying into the business.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.920
And at some point you would get some reward

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.000
for having done that.

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:05.440
And those are two very different things

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.760
in terms of what the equity implications are.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.480
It could also be implemented on a structural level,

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:13.640
because when I was thinking about crowdfunding,

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.080
it's not in the typical sense

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.600
that you would have to take some of your money

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:21.560
and put it into a crowdfunding project

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.400
or something like that.

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.480
But it could be implemented on a structural level

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.480
where each and everybody gets a certain amount of tokens

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.720
that you cannot spend for anything else,

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:37.400
that those are associated with some form of fund

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:42.400
for innovators who are kind of trying to test out new ideas

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.360
and stuff like that.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.320
So this would be a slightly different type of scheme.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.400
And one of the outputs for the people

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.040
who put in the tokens for a given project

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.000
could be that they might simply get the use value

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.920
that is being produced earlier than the others

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.440
or something like that.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:04.280
But this is a sidetrack, I would say.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.480
Yes, I mean, when I was thinking of research,

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.040
when I was thinking of Workers' Federations

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.760
having large research enterprises

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.040
that are affiliated with them,

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.040
I was thinking of them funding that.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.520
And I was thinking the same thing on the consumer side.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.800
On the other hand, you could basically have...

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.280
The tokens could be basically tokens

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:31.040
that individuals are saying, I want that research.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.120
I'm putting my token toward that research.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:35.880
Yeah.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.720
Yeah.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.040
And another question that I was asking myself

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.160
in terms of what you call user rights,

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.160
how do you distribute user rights over a given comments

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:52.520
so that whoever can make the best use of the comments

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.360
is actually allocated the right to use it?

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.520
Because this is a difficult question.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.400
I mean, there might be many people

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.760
who propose to use a given comments that is there to use,

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.040
and it's difficult to decide who might actually get it.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.360
This is the same subject as, well,

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.080
public versus private ownership.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.160
So let's step back to sort of old socialist times.

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.800
The first thing that the old socialists used to say is,

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.080
well, the means of production need to be...

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.880
The means of production shouldn't be in private hands.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:31.880
The means of production should be socially owned.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.960
And what kind of means of production

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.080
were they thinking about?

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.720
I mean, they were thinking about the factories

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.520
and the machines and the factories.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.000
They shouldn't belong to the capitalist.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.480
They should belong to all of the workers collectively.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.960
That means the economy still has to figure out

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.400
how to assign a particular factory or a particular machine

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.440
to be used by this group of workers

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.520
or that group of workers.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.400
And that's what the plan supposedly does.

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.320
Well, I mean, that also applies to land.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.320
I mean, land is like a machine.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.160
You use land to grow food.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.720
And in the Soviet Union, I mean,

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.920
I was thinking the other day in the early Soviet Union,

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.720
I mean, what actually produced the Russian Revolution

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.440
was when the peasants actually took over the land.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.160
It was 80% of the population.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.360
There's no Russian Revolution except the peasants say,

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.240
the feudal lords who used to own the land

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.360
and we worked on it as serfs

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.000
and then we became free to serfs

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.720
and we basically had to pay them rent.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.920
We're taking it over.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.760
And then they set up, sometimes they set up state farms.

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:49.440
That was the form in which the land is public was manifest.

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.400
Sometimes they set up collective farms,

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.680
which were somewhat different in terms of

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.360
how the land was handled on a collective farm

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.400
than a state farm.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.320
But certainly we have a sort of a history

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.440
of socialist believe that that land

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.360
and those factory and those machines,

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.120
it's what I call part of the productive commons

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.760
and it belongs to everybody and nobody.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.320
And the issue simply is figuring out

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.520
who gets user rights over it

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.200
on what sort of basis.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.800
And that's what the plan does.

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:30.960
So if you look at our participatory planning process

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.040
and if you're a worker council

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:38.040
and you're proposing to produce so many tomatoes

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.280
and so many heads of lettuce,

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.520
then you're also saying, well, one of the inputs is

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.440
we want these many acres of lands, et cetera, et cetera.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.120
And we don't want you to grow tomatoes on it

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.280
if it would be better for avocados.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.840
And if there's another worker council

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.560
that is wanting to land for avocados,

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.280
then they're gonna put in a proposal saying,

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.280
we wanna use it.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.640
So that's the importance of we wanna know

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.120
what the opportunity cost of using that land is

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.240
because we want it to go,

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.560
we want a system that will assign it

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.680
to whichever workers council

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.840
can make the most socially productive use of it.

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.400
And I think that's part of what the planning process

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.120
is actually doing.

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.840
Now, there's another part of the productive commons

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.520
that has been a lot trickier.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.000
So there was the traditional ideas

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
of the machines in the factory

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.880
and that sort of extends to land.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:41.040
But there's also that, I mean,

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.720
mainstream economists will call natural resources,

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.280
they call them natural capital.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.560
So you have produce capital machines, buildings,

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.520
you have natural capital and then you have human capital.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.160
And human capital is sort of my native talents

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.040
and my education and my training

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.520
is what gives a particular person

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.280
a certain amount of human capital.

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.360
Well, should that be socially owned?

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.960
Should we view that in the same way

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:18.240
that we view the machines and the factories

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.520
and the land and the natural capital

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.160
as it belongs to everybody and nobody?

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.360
No, it's me.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.800
I mean, it's mine.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.920
Well, how's that any different

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.240
from the way people used to think of this land is mine?

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.840
This machine is mine.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.760
That's the part I think that sort of

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.280
both politically and philosophically

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.960
and personally and psychologically becomes more difficult

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.280
for people to think in the same terms.

01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.200
We have argued that it's all the same.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.920
And so we sort of said,

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.120
it's all part of the productive commons

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.320
and it doesn't belong to anybody or it belongs neither,

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.200
it belongs both to all of us and none of us.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.360
And the question is simply how to use it

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.360
and how in a planning procedure to award user rights over it.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.080
There's of course a debate about,

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.600
I mean, when you're thinking about compensation,

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.320
there's been a long debate among socialists

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:34.640
about whether, well, if I have more human capital

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.960
and therefore the social value of my contribution

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.840
when I work an hour is higher than yours,

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.200
then I deserve higher pay.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.720
And then there are people who've argued,

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.840
no, that actually isn't, you don't deserve higher pay.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:53.120
You deserve higher pay if you made greater sacrifices maybe,

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.760
but not simply because you have more human capital

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.200
than somebody else.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.520
So those arguments have gone on forever amongst socialists.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:08.800
And what it reduces to is whether or not human capital

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:11.560
is are we gonna now consider human capital

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.720
the same way we consider natural capital,

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.760
the same way we consider produce capital

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.400
as it belongs to all of us and none of us.

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.200
It's something we collectively in our generation

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:28.800
inherit from all those previous generations before us.

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.680
And that's how it should be treated.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.640
And we wanna design an economic system

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.200
that treats it all that way.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:39.240
And that's been our vision and that's been our argument.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:43.360
But I know in terms of coming up,

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.520
I know that in terms of meeting opposition

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.600
from some fellow socialists

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.280
about whether or not they agree or don't agree

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.360
that this is an area of great disagreement.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.040
And when you think about it,

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.400
of course we know it's an area of great disagreement.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:07.720
It was hotly debated in the Soviet Union for 50 years

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.200
where there were time periods

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:13.240
when there were big bonuses given out to people,

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.160
to engineers and people, I mean, one of Stalin's,

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.640
in the early days, it was sort of,

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.360
well, everybody gets paid the same

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.760
and maybe we'll all argue about

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.440
everybody's gotta put in more effort

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.480
and we'll fight with each other

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:30.880
about you're slacking off and I, et cetera, et cetera.

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.240
But there was no sort of,

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:35.480
in the early days of the Russian revolution,

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.880
there wasn't strong support

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.560
for the more highly educated and the engineers

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.920
getting much higher pay scales.

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.640
Whereas at some point during the 30s and the 40s

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.280
and the 50s, that became,

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.600
Gorbachev finally sort of voiced

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.120
that as what socialism was.

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.560
He literally said that we,

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.960
people deserve to be paid

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.600
according to the value of their social contribution

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.320
and some people's social contribution

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.080
is objectively higher than other people

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.280
and it's perfectly fair that they be paid more

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.840
and they should be paid more.

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.000
Gorbachev finally arrived at the point of just saying,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.200
that's what the, that's the justification.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.400
We're doing it and we should be doing it.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.560
Whereas I think that I would always have argued

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.520
against that as being fair

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.920
and I think many socialists throughout history

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.400
have also felt no, that isn't particularly fair.

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.760
And just to check back whether or not I do get it right.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:39.480
So like very specifically on the question

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:42.520
of how it is being decided upon

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.920
who gets user rights over a given comments

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.160
and you already explained that your notion of the comments

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.160
is a very like enlarged version of the comments actually.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.680
So the answer to the question

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.920
of how this is being decided upon

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.440
is again, this question of social benefit.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.960
So whether or not a given resource

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.800
is actually being used in a way

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.800
so that the social benefit is higher than the social cost

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.000
and the way that this is being calculated

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.200
is along the lines of opportunity costs.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:27.040
Do I get that right?

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:27.880
Just to check it out.

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:31.680
Yeah, I wrote an article where I talked about it as,

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:36.560
I talked about it as the productive commons

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.040
for modern times.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.080
I think there was a time period

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.400
when socialists thought about the commons,

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.360
they just thought about the machines in the factory

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.200
and land.

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.760
And now what we, I mean, modern times requires us

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.600
to think about the productive column.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.840
So I'll list everything that's in the productive commons.

01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:00.560
It's those machines in the factories, just like always.

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.320
It's land.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.800
It's any other natural resources,

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:08.280
including that big thing up there

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:11.160
that is storing all our greenhouse gases,

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:14.120
which is basically like a commons

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.200
that whenever you use it and exploit it,

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:20.640
it's something that we need to take account of.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:27.200
I think that everything that mainstream economists

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.680
call human capital is part of the productive commons.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.000
And technology is part of the productive commons.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.920
And that's when we were talking about patent rights

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.200
and who gets to use it.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:41.360
And then we were talking about it in the context

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.800
of sort of stimulating innovation.

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.240
Whatever clever ways we have come up

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:49.760
with making things in the past.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.320
So all of that is part of what I simply call

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.360
the productive commons.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.360
And it doesn't belong any more to one person than another.

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:05.880
But it's important that we want to allocate user rights

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:10.200
over it to whoever can make the most efficient use of it.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.200
But nobody gets to reap the rewards personally

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.040
of the fact that they're using it.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:22.120
So if we give the machines to the workers in this factory

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.000
because they can make the best use of that machine,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.800
that doesn't mean the workers in this factory

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:31.120
get higher income than the workers in some other factory.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.160
And here's the real hard dividing line.

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.240
So in our annual planning process,

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.240
we're going to come up with the estimates

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.960
of the opportunity cost of using an hour

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:47.880
of electrical engineering labor.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:51.520
And we're going to come up with the opportunity cost

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.680
of using an hour of carpentry labor.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.440
And we're going to come up with the opportunity cost

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.640
of using an hour of just ditch digging labor.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.360
And they aren't going to be the same.

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.120
Now does that make sense?

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.640
Now does that mean that somebody in our economy

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.880
that digs ditches or works as an electrical engineer

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.200
or works as a carpenter is going to get paid higher wages?

01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.640
And our answer is no.

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.560
That'll be depending on inside their worker council,

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.480
whatever procedures their fellow workers set up

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:28.920
to decide whether they're putting in extra effort,

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.400
working extra hours,

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:36.560
working under less favorable or desirable conditions.

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.880
So that's the way that we think there is,

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.720
we think it's a separate logic

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.600
for how you allocate user rights over things,

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:52.480
including different categories of labor that doesn't,

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.520
but that doesn't have to,

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.960
for different categories of labor,

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.800
it does not have to translate into

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.480
that's how we therefore pay people differently.

01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:03.320
Which at a certain point in the early 1940s,

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.240
Stalin was just advocating

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.520
for those who were fortunate enough

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.400
to get the engineering degrees

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.360
and have those skilled kinds of labor

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.760
in the Soviet economy during that time period.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.920
I know the early years of the Cuban revolution

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.760
and when Che Guevara was still around,

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.560
they were very clear on this point.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.440
And the Cubans always had an attitude about it.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.840
I mean, their attitude about it in the early years

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.600
in the Cuban revolution was we only have the resources

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.680
to send so many people to school to become doctors

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.040
or to become engineers.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.080
And anybody that we sent to school doing that,

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.360
they're already lucky.

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:57.560
They're the ones that got the extra education

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.200
and we couldn't give it to everybody.

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.800
And they owe society.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.720
So the whole idea that you were lucky

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.360
that you were the one that was trained to be a doctor,

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.760
we have every right to send you out to work

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.240
for five years in the countryside,

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.600
giving, making sure that little kids

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.400
don't die from dehydration.

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.840
I mean, that's fair.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.160
The idea that you deserve to be paid 10 times more

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.480
than somebody who didn't get that extra education.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.360
In the early years of the Cuban revolution,

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.520
there was a very broad consciousness.

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.240
I think there still is in Cuba

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.520
of a relatively healthy consciousness,

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.840
I would call it on this subject.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.840
I think before we move on to the more long-term questions,

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.280
long-term questions, actually,

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:52.600
I think it would be important maybe in order to close

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.000
the case of the basic elements of Paragon

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.200
to take a closer look at some elements

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:00.600
we kind of touched upon,

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.480
but haven't yet really talked through.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.800
One of those would be balanced job complexes

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.520
because this is actually a very important basic principle

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.640
within Paragon as well.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.480
And we haven't actually laid it out in concrete terms,

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.400
I think.

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.400
So maybe could you explain what are balanced job complexes

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.440
and why do you think that they are a good idea to implement?

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:33.240
Okay, there's two different issues.

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.360
You can balance jobs in two respects.

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.800
One would be for empowerment

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.920
and the other would be for desirability

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.720
or undesirability, whatever.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.360
So first, let's look at how it is

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.520
that most jobs look in capitalism.

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.080
We could also look and see how do most jobs look

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.440
in the centrally planned socialist economies too.

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:02.720
In both cases, what you find is that

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.480
a small percentage of a workplace

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:11.400
have jobs that consists of a number of tasks

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.640
and sort of approximately how many hours a week

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.720
you work in these different tasks.

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.320
These are tasks where you're sitting in on meetings,

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.360
where you're going over different options

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.440
for what might happen.

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:28.280
Or these would be tasks where you're just,

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:31.680
I used to work in steel mills in the summers

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.920
when I was going to college.

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.920
And they would throw us into the crews

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.560
where we would have to go out

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:42.240
and underneath the open hearth furnaces,

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.240
all of this sort of burnt coal ash would come down.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.080
And at some point the tunnels would fill up

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.640
and you have to send somebody in there

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.800
to shovel it out into wheelbarrows.

01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.800
Rote labor, not pleasant, nothing empowering about it.

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.680
It just made your muscles sore when you went home at night.

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:07.680
So in almost any capitalist workplace you go to

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.680
and I think in most of the centrally planned economies,

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:17.840
certainly by the second half of the 20th century,

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:22.280
what you're gonna find is you've got a small number of people

01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.480
who do managerial type tasks.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.600
And then you've got most of the people

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.520
just carrying out somebody's orders,

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.960
doing something that's more or less mind numbing.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:38.720
Well, clearly some tasks empower people

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.720
to be both more knowledgeable about the kinds of decisions

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.600
that have to be made in enterprise

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.120
and to sort of have the skills and habits

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.520
to be effective in expressing their opinions on the subject.

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:59.000
So the whole idea that, well, we want our workers councils.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.600
We're giving everybody one vote.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:07.880
Ultimately, we're saying at a stockholders meeting

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.440
in a capitalist corporation,

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.120
ultimately you get as many votes

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.600
as you have shares of stock.

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:19.560
In a workers council, everybody gets one vote.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:23.240
But if you have some people doing all of these empowering

01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.840
tasks day in and out and you have other people

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.480
in the workplace doing these rote sort of mindless jobs

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:35.120
day in and day out, then clearly although they have

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:39.600
an equal right to vote in the meetings,

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.680
they aren't gonna arrive at those meetings

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:47.120
sort of equally empowered to be effective in the meetings.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.080
This is something that, I mean, in Yugoslavia,

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.120
we had a 20, 30 year experience

01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:00.120
with workers self-management in enterprises.

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:05.160
And one of the very discouraging trends

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.560
was that in the early years,

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:10.200
there was a lot more active participation

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.360
on the part of a much larger percentage

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.080
of workers in the enterprise.

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:19.080
And as time went on, all the sociological studies

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:22.880
about the activity of the participation declined over time.

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.360
And I think there was a reason for that,

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.760
that they didn't balance jobs for empowerment.

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:33.000
They made no particular effort to do that.

01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:37.120
So if you really want what I would call

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.800
real workplace democracy rather than just formal,

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.880
everybody gets one vote democracy,

01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:46.800
then there's a very strong argument

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:50.000
that I think socialists should want to see.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Job descriptions revised so that to the extent

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:56.800
that it's reasonable and possible,

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:58.880
you want to include empowering tasks

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.760
along with disempowering tasks

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:03.040
in everybody's job description.

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.360
And does that mean that in a hospital,

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.600
sometimes a surgeon might actually have to spend

01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:10.400
some hours changing bedpans?

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.960
My answer is yes.

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.760
And then we can argue about whether that's

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:19.360
not a very inefficient use of that skilled surgeon's time.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.280
But any case, so that's what the balancing

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:25.480
for empowerment about.

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.760
It's basically saying if you look at our,

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.600
if you look at both capitalism and state socialism,

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.720
really was a remarkable similarity

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:39.360
in terms of how jobs were structured

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.520
and the fact that some of them,

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:43.880
a small number of them were rather empowered,

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.880
had the effect of empowering the people

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:47.720
who carried out those tasks.

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.120
And for most people, the effect was to disempower you

01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:54.920
in terms of your, in any case.

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.640
Now that's a little different from desirability.

01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:00.520
So the argument in favor of empowering for desirability

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:04.000
is that's how you encourage and make sure

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.920
that you don't have an erosion of the exercise

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:12.240
of economic democracy in the workplaces.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.080
Balancing for desirability is an equity issue.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And there is another way of taking care of that

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.040
and that is the worker's council.

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:26.600
So, I mean, where does that come from?

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.360
Well, why should somebody's job be remarkably,

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.640
why should somebody's job be much more unpleasant

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:36.320
than somebody else's job?

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.440
Where's the justice in that?

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.640
So you can put the question simply that way.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.040
And my answer would be there is no justice in that

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.800
unless there was some compensation.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.400
So that's where there is sort of an alternative way

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.160
to take care of the injustice if somebody's job

01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:59.320
has a whole bunch of tasks that are really unpleasant

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.720
and somebody else's job never has any tasks

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:04.920
that are unpleasant, the changing bedpans.

01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:09.920
In that case, you could compensate the person

01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:14.920
that has the job that is less pleasant to perform.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.600
And you could say that's part of why somebody

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.360
would deserve greater compensation.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.000
So in that case, there's two ways of taking care of it.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Our actual proposal is, we basically propose

01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.400
consciousness raising amongst workers

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.400
about these issues in their workplace.

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.160
And we propose that we think you should set up,

01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.200
like we used to, originally we just called them

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:43.760
effort rating companies.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.800
We just called them effort rating committees.

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.440
But we were thinking more along the lines

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:50.600
of sort of any differential sacrifice.

01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.680
And we think you should set up procedures

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.680
for trying to balance the tasks and the time people

01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.760
are spending in tasks so that you,

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:02.560
so that you don't have this terrible imbalance

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:06.520
in terms of the empowerment effects of work life.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.680
But you obviously are gonna have to go about this

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.520
as you see fit.

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:17.040
So these are what I call injunctions and arguments.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.800
But the bottom line is, nobody from the outside

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.720
is coming in and telling you how you do it.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.200
And if push comes to shove and a workplace,

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:34.600
a bunch of workplace council and then a workers council

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.080
doesn't wanna do these things,

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:41.240
I would be very loathe to say somehow you get called up

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:45.880
before a tribunal and put on trial for it.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.120
I mean, if you don't do them, you don't do them.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.680
In our mind, they're part of what socialism should be like

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.640
and should be about.

01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.760
But we're very libertarian in our anarchist tendencies

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.520
in terms of whether this is something that is imposed

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.560
or this is something that we are talking about

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.400
building a culture for.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:08.880
Yeah, and I think at least for me,

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:13.880
the last statements are very important to me,

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:17.800
I have to say, because I'm not a big fan

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.800
of the effort-raiding committees, to be honest,

01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:26.800
because I sense the real danger of this becoming real ugly

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.680
and creating some form of toxic workplace.

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:33.680
And I would very much advise

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
anyone to not go this road,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.880
but I very much appreciate that within Paragon,

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:42.480
you give this kind of flexibility

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:46.480
in order to approach the things that you recommend

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:49.560
in the terms of, for example, balance,

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:53.040
job complexes or effort-raiding committees.

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.040
But if a worker council does have a different type

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:59.040
of culture within the given worker council

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:00.960
and wants to do things differently,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.360
this is absolutely compatible with Paragon

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.080
as such, as I understand it.

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:08.480
Well, there's the largest actual experience

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:13.480
of a group of workplaces trying to apply these principles,

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:17.360
including, and in particular, the job balancing,

01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:22.880
balancing for both empowerment and balancing for,

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:25.720
you know, for desirability and effort-raiding.

01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:29.280
There was a lot of, you know,

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:33.000
there was a whole network of,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.320
they were called the Mondragon, it was called the A-Zone,

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:38.720
and they were called the Mondragon,

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:41.960
not to be confused with the Mondragon cooperatives

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:43.480
in the Basque region of Spain.

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.080
And I'm not quite sure why they chose,

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:49.840
I think they might've chose the word Mondragon in Winnipeg

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.600
in sort of honor of that,

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.680
but they're very, very different.

01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:58.760
And there was a coffee house, a restaurant,

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:03.080
a radio station, a bicycle repair,

02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:06.560
sort of a delivery business.

02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:10.240
And they all were in this sort of,

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:14.120
they all had offices in this sort of building

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:16.120
that they jointly had,

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:20.760
and they very self-consciously tried to operate

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:24.960
their collectives on the basis of paragon principles.

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.800
They did it for about 20 years.

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.240
And so I'm aware of debates and discussions

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:34.680
that went on amongst them.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:39.720
One of the founders, Paul Burroughs,

02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.320
has gone on to do some other things,

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.560
but he now is,

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:46.400
he's now been active back on the forum

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.640
on the participatoryeconomy.org website,

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.120
discussing exactly this thing.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.800
Because it is one of the things

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.520
that has been most controversial.

02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.520
And I can say that what Mondragon ended up doing

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:06.720
was not really trying to do

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.520
any sort of detailed effort rating.

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.960
They argued about it a lot.

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.200
It was quite controversial.

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:20.760
And they ended up saying,

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.800
no, it's gonna come down to hours.

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:28.640
And if there's a real problem with just,

02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:31.400
you're not putting in effort,

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:34.840
then it's an issue of firing,

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.880
it's an issue of the rest of us saying,

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:39.080
this is just too detrimental to the rest of us.

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:42.640
You either have to ship up or you have to shape up

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.560
or you really shouldn't be working here anymore.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.000
Rather than sort of having an effort rating committee

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.720
where at the end of every six months or so.

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:54.960
So I know that's what they came up with.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:00.640
I am sure that, here's my dilemma.

02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:02.120
My dilemma is the following.

02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.880
Those of us who are even talking about it,

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.560
we've already decided that we're leftists and we're socialists.

02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:15.720
And therefore, we don't think it should be necessary

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.040
to get into this kind of invidious comparisons.

02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.240
And we would just find it toxic.

02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:28.400
And my answer to all of us is I have two,

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.600
and I have two things to say about that.

02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.800
Just like you, when I go to search for a worker's council

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.200
to work for in a participatory economy,

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:41.480
I will look for one that adopts that attitude

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.560
toward effort rating.

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.000
Because that'll make me happiest there.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.480
I mean, one of the things that people should look at,

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.680
I mean, people do this in capitalism.

02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:55.480
They look to see, well, what's your pay structure

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.840
and how are you gonna, when can I first put in

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.040
for a promotion?

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:04.560
So I think one of the things that people will sensibly look

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:07.240
at in a participatory economy when they decide

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:09.200
where they want to apply to a workplace is

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:12.240
to look and see what is the workplace's procedures

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.560
in this regard or the ones I would like

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.000
or the ones I would feel comfortable with or not.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.480
But here's my dilemma.

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:21.440
I talk to people who would not be comfortable

02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:25.720
in a work environment where they think

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:27.680
that people who don't work as hard

02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.960
are gonna get just as rewarded as they are.

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:35.160
And I know that they would want some sort of procedures

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:40.160
where slackers would be identified by fellow workers

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:45.680
and would be told, look, it's okay

02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.280
if you don't wanna work as hard.

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.640
But please recognize that that means

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:52.840
you shouldn't be rewarded quite as much.

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.160
So that's another issue.

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:58.040
And the usual way of handling this,

02:03:58.040 --> 02:03:59.440
I mean, the way it was always handled

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.720
in the Soviet Union was everybody should be working

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.480
harder than anybody can imagine.

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.120
And I mean, I grew up as an, I grew up

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:16.440
as enough of a hippie to know that is insane.

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:18.840
That's not a good life.

02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.600
So there's nothing wrong with somebody saying,

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:27.200
hey, you wanna go out there and bust your hump?

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.760
That's fine.

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.080
I don't have to do that.

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.320
I don't wanna, I don't choose to do that.

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:36.920
On the other hand, I think one should concede

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:39.960
that if somebody else is making more sacrifices

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:44.320
then they deserve some degree of extra compensation

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:46.440
that's commensurate with that.

02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.920
And it is my personal choice.

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.480
So I wanna give people the,

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:53.560
I wanna preserve personal choice

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:56.520
over how much effort people put into work.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.840
But I think there's a responsible way to do that,

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.840
which is I choose more, I mean, we know there's a sort

02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:08.280
of choose between leisure and income,

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.440
who we think of it as in terms of hours.

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:13.560
You can also choose between leisurely pace of work

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:15.080
and income.

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:17.040
There's no reason people shouldn't make,

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:19.280
people should have the right to choose that.

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.000
They make that choice for themselves.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.400
Why not?

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:25.120
There's nothing socially irresponsible about saying

02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.160
I want a more leisurely pace of work,

02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:30.240
but my more leisurely pace of work,

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:34.200
I think basically entitles me to what I'm saying is

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.440
I want that more leisurely pace of work.

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.280
And yes, I accept somewhat less compensation

02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:42.800
for the fact that it's not as big a sacrifice

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:44.200
as somebody else is making.

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:48.000
So that's where that all has landed.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.160
In the end, we leave it up to workers councils.

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:55.080
We recommend that people take that into consideration.

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.440
When you decide where to apply to work,

02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:59.400
you wanna go to work someplace

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:01.280
where they have the same values on that,

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:04.120
where they've come to the same set of values on that subject

02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:06.800
that you feel that you're comfortable with.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:10.480
But I do know that there are people out there

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.920
who are very loathe to think that this system

02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:15.520
would be a good system that they would be happy in.

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:18.360
If they imagine themselves working in a place

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:21.720
where they work hard and other people don't,

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:24.800
and the other people get away with it

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:26.720
and get paid the same as them.

02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:30.560
And they find that something, I don't like that system.

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:33.320
And I think there's a point to be made there too.

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.280
I also think there's a real bias.

02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:38.480
Those of us who even talk about this

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:43.400
clearly are more inclined to don't wanna get into it.

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:44.920
People will be responsible.

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:46.600
And if they're really irresponsible,

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:50.280
then you admonish them in some sort of way.

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.280
You give them a warning and finally you just say,

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.080
well, you just don't wanna,

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.040
the rest of us don't wanna work with you.

02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:57.880
But I think that there's a real,

02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:01.680
I think that leftists are predictably farther

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.360
in that direction than your average person out there

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.080
in the population that we talk to

02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:08.160
about different economic systems.

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:11.560
Cause I know this reaction to the students in my classes.

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:13.800
Cause students in my classes are basically

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.560
the average US population in some sense.

02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:19.720
They're, a tiny percentage of them are leftists.

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:25.120
And I know from their reaction over the years,

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:29.840
they find it comforting that there'd be procedures

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:33.000
to distinguish between people who are working hard

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.400
and people who aren't.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:38.600
Yeah, I think I subsumed this also somehow

02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.360
under the question of transition,

02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:42.480
because the way that you approach it

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:45.880
by providing a plurality of approaches

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:50.880
to different people who might be in a different

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:54.520
state of mind towards these questions

02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:59.520
so that they can build it in a way that works for them

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:00.920
for the moment.

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:05.600
I mean, this also includes some danger, of course,

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.400
in the sense that it might lead to structures

02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:13.040
that reproduce this kind of thinking

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:14.800
that you just described from your students,

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:18.640
this kind of like a bit greedy and competitive type

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:22.240
of behavior of thinking about one another.

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.480
And there's this danger of like reproducing this

02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.880
by producing institutions and structures

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:33.840
within a given workers council that, as I said,

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:35.920
produces this kind of thinking as well.

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.800
But as I said, I absolutely appreciate this plurality

02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:44.800
and my vote would go out for not like going down the road

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.840
of effort-raiding committees.

02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:51.920
And also in terms of sacrifice and effort,

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.520
I find it very difficult to really evaluate

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.280
whether or not someone is putting in effort or not,

02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:01.840
because this could look very differently

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.920
for a different type of person.

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:06.480
And at some point within your newest book,

02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:10.480
you also write, but are people equally able to sacrifice

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:12.960
or is it easier for some to make sacrifices

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:15.800
than it is for others, just as it is easier

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:18.960
for some to perform difficult and valuable physical

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.840
or mental tasks than it is for others?

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:24.800
And then you state questions such as these make me happy.

02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:26.320
I'm not a philosopher.

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:29.840
What can one say except perhaps, end quote.

02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.520
And I would add to this, perhaps I would say for sure,

02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:37.920
I'm quite sure that it is actually impossible

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:41.000
to really evaluate whether someone is putting in effort

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.920
and not, and to some people it comes more naturally

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.160
at different things and to others not.

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:50.200
So I would actually be kind of skeptical,

02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:54.240
but as I said, I highly appreciate this flexibility

02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.280
within your approach.

02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:57.280
So-

02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:59.080
There's actually a very active debate

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:03.400
amongst the collective that manages the,

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:04.920
actually one of the two brothers

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:08.480
who are the most active managers of the website.

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:13.240
Jason raised that on the discussion forum

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.680
and said that he thinks that there's a discussion

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.920
about whether we should stop using the word effort

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.480
in this regard.

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:23.040
Yeah, but it's not an easy issue.

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.120
It's not an easy issue.

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:29.000
And it is one that people care tremendously about.

02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:31.960
And it's also one where you don't,

02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:34.240
it's also one where, I mean, when we're starting

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.560
to talk about opportunity costs and social costs,

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:40.960
and whether a planning mechanism will do this or that,

02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:43.800
well, I mean, there it requires some expertise.

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.800
This isn't any subject that anybody feels

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:49.120
requires any expertise they don't have,

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:55.080
which I always appreciate a subject where everybody thinks

02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:58.920
that they are equally equipped to argue and debate,

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:02.200
and their view is just as valid as anybody else.

02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:05.040
I think it's lucky when we have a subject

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:07.080
where everybody thinks that way about it.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.040
And I think this is one of those subjects.

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:12.880
Everybody has a very firm opinion

02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:14.680
about what they think is fair and not fair

02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:16.560
in terms of economic compensation.

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:18.920
Interesting.

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:22.320
One question that I have in the back of my mind

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:25.240
all of the time when you're talking about

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:28.640
like the ways in which these workers councils

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.760
are organized internally,

02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.760
how you might achieve self-management and so on and so forth

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:37.920
is the question of scaling.

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:42.920
So how big can these councils actually become

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:46.640
in order to stay true to these principles

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.440
that you would like to see being enacted

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.680
within these worker councils?

02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:54.480
Because people who have experiences

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:56.640
with self-organized structures,

02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.240
they might know that this is very much difficult.

02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:03.760
It's very, very difficult to achieve

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:06.520
like organizations of scale

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:11.520
that are actually really true to principles

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.840
that Perikan tries to promote.

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.080
So how do you think about this question of scale?

02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:22.640
The simple answer is we're agnostic on that subject.

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:26.200
But that doesn't mean,

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:28.160
there seem to be some things

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:32.840
that clearly the smaller the workers council,

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:37.080
the easier it is for people,

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.240
for everybody to participate in all aspects.

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.760
So you can ask yourself,

02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:45.160
is there an optimal size

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:47.400
just in terms of how would

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.640
participatory democratic decision-making procedures

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.000
function best?

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.040
Obviously from a technology production side,

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.080
there's also issues about scale.

02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.920
And here there's a useful difference.

02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:09.920
I mean, economists talk about true economies of scale,

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.120
which can be distinguished

02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:15.800
from financial economies of scale.

02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.960
So in a capitalist economy,

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:23.920
there are frequently advantages of being larger,

02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:26.680
like being an oligopoly or a monopoly even.

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:31.360
Not necessarily because the technology dictates it.

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.320
So we wouldn't want workers councils

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.120
to become large for what in capitalism

02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:43.680
would be financial economies of scale reasons.

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.640
But in terms of social costs

02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:48.600
and lowest social cost of production,

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:51.400
there are true economies of scale

02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.200
where probably the efficient size

02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:01.280
for a workers council producing steel

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:04.720
is different from the efficient size

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:09.200
for a workers council that's a haircut salon.

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.440
So when I said we're agnostic,

02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.720
we just, we recognize all that.

02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:18.080
And we don't think, I mean,

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.360
so suppose you have a workers council

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:23.760
where true economies of scale are significant.

02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:26.040
And so we're really talking about an enterprise

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.040
that makes sense that has a couple of thousand members.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.720
Well, then you clearly would have to sort of,

02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:37.840
you're going to have different divisions.

02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:40.840
I mean, something that large is going to have different,

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:44.560
I mean, in a steel mill, there was the blast furnace,

02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:47.880
there's the open hearth furnace,

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:49.840
there's the warehouses,

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:53.320
there's the sheet metal cutting places.

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.640
So there's all these sort of divisions.

02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.520
And in a large enterprise,

02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:03.520
you would want to have sort of sub worker councils,

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:05.760
for the different divisions.

02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:09.480
There's a whole bunch of decisions in the blast furnace area

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.360
that really don't affect the rest of the plant that much.

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:16.320
But it seems like that, I mean, so that is our approach.

02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:19.920
That would be the sensible way to approach that.

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.400
The only thing that should not come into play

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.000
are in capitalist economies,

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:28.800
financial economies of scale,

02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:33.800
sometimes give you extra market power advantages.

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:36.720
And that's why a firm will get that big.

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:41.720
And certainly, and we don't think that any workers council,

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:48.960
Mondragon set up operations in China.

02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:53.600
And the Chinese operation was not self-managed

02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.680
by Chinese workers at the Mondragon place in China.

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:04.120
So that's for both, that you can't have.

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.520
So you're not, I mean,

02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:12.520
a lot of the world's large corporations are now global.

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:15.200
And so we're not talking about that at all.

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:16.600
None of these worker councils

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:19.600
are operating outside of the country.

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.960
In general, so there would not be any-

02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:26.680
Well, they can export, they can import.

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.400
I mean, there's a chapter in the last,

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.120
in democratic economic planning

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.480
that addresses the sort of new practical issue.

02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:40.400
There was a point in time when socialists thought that

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:43.920
when socialism finally came to power any place,

02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:46.800
the idea was gonna be so obviously wonderful

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.120
that the workers were gonna revolt every place

02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:52.560
and we were gonna have socialism everywhere.

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:56.400
Even Lenin thought there were gonna be revolutions

02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:58.360
in Germany and Europe,

02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:02.240
and that they weren't gonna have an isolated Soviet Union.

02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.560
And Trotskyists for a long time argued

02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.040
that you really can't have socialism in one country.

02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:09.680
Well, it's apparent now

02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:12.560
that if we can't have socialism in one country at a time,

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:13.640
we're never gonna have it,

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:16.880
because at this point in the 20th century,

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:19.560
it's very clear to me that it's highly unlikely

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:20.880
that we aren't gonna have,

02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:24.720
who knows what country it's going to be,

02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.240
but countries are gonna try and become socialist

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.560
in a world where there are still huge differences

02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:32.760
in levels of economic development

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:35.520
and where a lot of the countries are capitalist countries

02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:36.840
that they have to interact with.

02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:39.200
And then the question is, how do you interact?

02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:41.640
So we finally address that in the most recent book,

02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:43.400
we'd never talked about it before,

02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.400
and sort of proposed how could a socialist,

02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.560
a country with a socialist economy

02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.360
take part in international trade

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.960
in a way that was beneficial to them,

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:55.760
but didn't violate their fundamental principles

02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:59.240
in some way that eroded the sort of moral

02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.040
and political glue that held their system together.

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:04.840
And we basically said,

02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:06.120
the one thing that's ruled out

02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:07.600
is direct foreign investment.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.960
You can't allow a capitalist firm coming

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.200
and come into a participatory economy

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:14.840
and set up a capitalist,

02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:16.520
engage in direct foreign investment,

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.360
run as a capitalist firm inside the socialist economy.

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:22.240
And we said, we don't think workers councils

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:23.960
in the socialist economy

02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:27.640
can basically do direct foreign investment abroad.

02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:30.760
But we do think that there's no reason

02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:32.240
that a participatory economy

02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:34.280
couldn't trade with the rest of the world,

02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:37.440
including trading with capitalist countries

02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:40.960
and including taking into account dramatic differences

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:42.600
in levels of economic development

02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:44.200
in terms of the terms of trade.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.080
And even international financial investment

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.240
is something we think is possible

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:54.800
for a participatory economy to engage in.

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:56.520
And a participatory economy could engage

02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:58.520
in international financial investment,

02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:00.440
both outgoing and ingoing.

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:03.560
It's a question of how you treat the interest rate.

02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:05.600
And with certain partners,

02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:07.920
you have to treat the interest rate differently.

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:09.520
But that's not something that wasn't discussed.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.120
I mean, there was a huge discussion

02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:14.680
in Cuba used to lecture the Soviet Union

02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:16.880
and the Eastern European economies

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:19.160
about the morality of the difference

02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:21.640
between being a lesser developed country

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:23.480
and a more developed country.

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:25.680
I mean, Che Guevara was famous for just saying,

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:28.440
well, we assume that your socialist principles

02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:31.760
will help you understand

02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.640
why you should afford favorable terms of trade

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:37.920
towards your brother socialist Cuban economy.

02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:42.680
Now, to some extent, the Soviet Union did do that,

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:46.640
but more for geopolitical purposes

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:48.800
than commitments to socialist principles.

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:50.800
But in any case, this isn't something

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:52.560
that hasn't been discussed before.

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.400
But I do think that amongst socialist in 2020,

02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:00.840
that discussion now has to be,

02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:03.400
we now have a new perspective realism

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:07.560
about how socialism will eventually come to the world.

02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.520
It'll come a little here and a little there.

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:10.920
And there's a long period of time

02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:13.360
where you have to have some sensible answers

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:16.320
to how do those countries interact and economic,

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:20.920
how do they engage in economic interactions

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:21.880
with other countries?

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:24.040
You've got to have a more sensible discussion of that

02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:25.440
than we've ever had before.

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:30.440
That was our show for today.

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:34.240
