00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and today's episode is a very special episode.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
Not only is it the last one of the year 2020, but it also is a new Future Histories live episode.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
This time, Mattia Paganelli invited me to hold a guest lecture at his seminar on computational arts

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
at the Goldsmiths College in London, which I of course happily accepted.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
And since the guest lecture was three hours long, I proposed a format in which I would hold a short presentation

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
on podcasting as a form of extended research and then afterwards record an episode of Future Histories live in front of the students.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm absolutely thrilled that Benjamin Bratton agreed to be the interviewee for this Future Histories live episode.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I will introduce him at the beginning of the interview and so I will restrain myself to saying that

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
for me, Benjamin is one of the most interesting thinkers of our time.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
His book, The Stack, is rich beyond belief and his work tries to bridge a gap that absolutely needs to be worked at

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
and that is the bridge between political theory and the techno-social realities and possibilities of our time.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
My warmest thanks go out to Mattia for the invitation to hold the guest lecture,

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
to Benjamin for taking part in the interview and the discussion afterwards,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
and to the students of the seminar on computational arts for their participation.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
We talked quite a bit and so I split the interview into two parts,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
of which you will hear the first one today and the second one in two weeks' time.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
This will be in 2021, which leads me to wishing all of you a happy new year.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
Thank you for your interest in Future Histories, your thoughts, mails, tweets, your suggestions for guests and topics.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
I know 2020 has been shitty, but there are good things too and I thank you all for that.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
But now, enjoy today's episode of Future Histories with the great Benjamin Bratton

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
on Synthetic Catalyxies, Platforms of Platforms and Red Futurism.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So, welcome to Future Histories.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
My name is Jan GroÃŸ and I am very excited to welcome Benjamin Bratton as a guest in today's episode.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Benjamin is Professor of Visual Arts and Director of the Center for Design and Geopolitics

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
at the University of California, San Diego,

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
as well as Program Director of the Terraforming Program at the Strelka Institute in Moscow.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Welcome, Benjamin.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Thank you very much for having me. Pleasure to be here.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
There are multiple episodes of Future Histories that are, in one way or another,

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
concerned with the topic of cybernetic plant economies in the age of their technical feasibility.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
You have talked and written about this topic and you introduced a term that might be helpful

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
to understand what we are dealing with, synthetic catalyxy.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
What are synthetic catalyxies and what openings do they possibly provide?

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
So, yes, thank you for the invitation to speak with you.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
This term, synthetic catalyxy, is probably a good place to start.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
On this question of a planned economy versus an unplanned economy,

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
and maybe as a way of also perhaps beginning the conversation with some consideration of what we mean by a plan,

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
what we mean by unplanned, and maybe even what we mean by economy in this way.

03:50.000 --> 04:04.000
So the term, the catalyxy originally, the reference that I'm drawing this from is in reference to the work of Hayek,

04:04.000 --> 04:16.000
who uses this term catalyxy as part of his argument against socialist planned economies

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
and the mid-20th century model of a socialist planned economy, which we should be clear right away.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
When we're thinking about what a planned economy might be for the 21st century,

04:30.000 --> 04:42.000
the models of a planned economy from the mid-20th century may not necessarily be the model reference that we should be building on.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
But suffice to say, for Hayek, he sees markets themselves,

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
and it should be maybe clear not necessarily capitalism as a whole, but markets, at least in theory,

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
as not only a space or a place by which supply and demand might meet each other,

05:06.000 --> 05:15.000
but also as a kind of calculation machine, as a kind of collaborative calculation machine

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
that has capacities both for feats of tremendous abstraction,

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
but also for the sort of direct fulfillment of supply and demand in the simplest sense.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
But the catalyxy then refers to this capacity of markets to be pricing mechanisms,

05:36.000 --> 05:47.000
that markets find prices, that how much the bananas should cost or how many desks and chairs should be produced

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
is in essence calculated itself through the dynamics of the market.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
And so it's an understanding of the market as a kind of, not just something about which computation might be interested

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
or something about which computation might be used to organize, but that the market itself has computational capacities,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
that it is a kind of computational apparatus.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
Now, as I'm sure you are quite aware because of all of the other, the discussions that you've kind of had,

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
he's proposing this in contradistinction to the classical socialist pricing problem,

06:28.000 --> 06:40.000
which argues that no planned economy can possibly provide that calculative function that a market does

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
as quickly or as efficiently as the market can itself.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
And you might imagine it sort of like if you have 10 people sitting in a room

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
and they want to have a conversation with each other and negotiate something,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
like how should we rearrange the furniture in this room?

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
And in order for the furniture in the room to be reorganized,

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
all those 10 people would have to, let's say, write down their interest on a piece of paper

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
and then send it to the office across the street.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And then the office across the street will get all of these pieces of paper

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
and then send pieces of paper back to every one of these 10 people one by one.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And you imagine what this conversation would be like if every time anybody needed to say anything,

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
you have to send what you wanted to say across the street to an office who then makes this plan

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
and then sends it back to you.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
You would say, well, it would be just simpler if we just let, we had the conversation ourselves.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
So in any event, I'm not an Austrian, this isn't my approach,

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
but just to give a sense of what the idea comes from.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
Now, one of the points that was made, and I'm sure you've raised this in some of your other podcasts,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
even back in the 60s and 70s was that, well, fine,

07:56.000 --> 08:06.000
but the capacity for computation and particular network computation,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
artificial computation, not the natural, let's say the natural computation of the market,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
but the artificial computation that when we think of computers and computer networks,

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
you know, silicon-based computation, to send and receive information from one point to another point,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
they already sort of understood that this was increasingly fast

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
and again, sort of in the height of the Cold War, 60s and 70s here,

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
and the capacity of synthetic calculation through silicon-based computation

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
was also becoming increasingly fast.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
And so this argument, and then even the metaphor that I'm using of the piece of paper

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
walking across the street and stuff, this kind of bureaucratic model of,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
this particular kind of bureaucratic model of a planned economy,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
was probably out of date to a great extent.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
And that the scenario people would ask is like, okay, but what if you could,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
what if those messages of interest that everyone had in that rearrangement of the furniture

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
could be said essentially instantaneously across the street,

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
that it could be mapped against a thousand different ideal models of furniture rearrangement

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and then instantaneously sent back.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Would not this allow for actually an acceleration in the capacity for that conversation

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
and that negotiation to take place in such a way that this would work?

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
And that not only could artificial computation operate to produce things like pricing signals

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
and structure models that was equally fast to the kind of emergent processes of the market,

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
but perhaps even faster, and perhaps could draw upon models and again, best practices

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
and other kinds of things and goals and larger sort of macro programs

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
that would not be available to just a small group of people doing this negotiation.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
And so this became, as you've all been discussing,

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
the basis of sort of the first wave of an interest in a kind of socialist cybernetics economics

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
that ended up, you know, was animated the work of, you know, people like to refer to Stafford Beer,

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
but also, you know, even in others, in certain sense, even across the political spectrum,

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
but certainly gave the rise to a kind of a different kind of idea of the mixture

10:41.000 --> 10:49.000
between computation, socialism, and the planned economy here as well.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
So the term synthetic catalacticy that I use, that I mentioned in the book, The Stack,

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
going now back to your original question, is a term that would refer to that process

11:02.000 --> 11:11.000
by which the natural capacity for a market to find price signals, for example,

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
or to organize the relations between its negotiated participants

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
could produce this kind of what the Austrian school and its descendants like to think of

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
as a kind of spontaneous order, could produce this process of a spontaneous order at a great distance

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
and could do so at a scale, by using very large-scale computational systems,

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
planetary-scale computational systems, that that spontaneous order could be produced at a scale

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
that would be otherwise impossible to do just through the incremental aggregation

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
of lots and lots of different supply and demand signals,

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
could do so with a speed that would be impossible otherwise, and in principle could do so

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
with a capacity for reflexive collective reason that would be impossible otherwise,

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
and would be able to do so with some degree of recursive piloting or planning,

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
and this is where the cybernetic comes in, the kind of piloting function of the whole dynamic

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
in ways that would be impossible to happen just spontaneously.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Now, as you are all probably aware, Hayek sort of pooh-poohed this whole idea,

12:35.000 --> 12:53.000
and indeed it was some of the Chicago school boys who were enthusiastic about the coup in Chile in 1973

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
that moved Allende and Stafford Beer's CyberSign project out of the way,

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
who later ended up becoming quite interested in the idea of the capacity for computational systems

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
to have these kinds of recursive market effects.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
And so the last point I'll make before we move on from this with this and also to maybe introduce,

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
frame part of our discussion around the planned economy in relationship to socialism and capitalism per se,

13:24.000 --> 13:33.000
is that perhaps one of the historical ironies of all of this is that we do have planned economies today.

13:33.000 --> 13:42.000
We do have large-scale synthetic catalaxies in the scale that I'm describing,

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
in that this is how Walmart works, this is how Amazon works,

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
this is how Google works in terms of its pricing of words and semantics and page views and the rest of this as well,

13:56.000 --> 14:05.000
is that many of the large capitalist platforms that increasingly, in a de facto basis,

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
have taken on many of the roles that had previously been assigned to states,

14:13.000 --> 14:24.000
themselves are in ways that would absolutely be recognized as such in the high X era of the 60s and 70s, planned economies.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
And they work because they are planned economies.

14:28.000 --> 14:37.000
They work because they are able to calculate prices by integrating signals

14:37.000 --> 14:48.000
with a speed and scale and complexity that would be impossible to do otherwise,

14:48.000 --> 14:58.000
which allows them to do long-term planning, long-term recursive investment,

14:58.000 --> 15:06.000
infrastructural investment and so forth and so on, all the things that the socialist cyberneticians were interested in,

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
in ways that they too would recognize as basically, yes, that's what we meant.

15:11.000 --> 15:20.000
And this, again, is kind of the irony, that you can imagine plucking some of the socialist cybernetician economists from the mid-60s

15:20.000 --> 15:28.000
and explaining to them how Amazon works, this very, very large scale global network that doesn't actually produce anything,

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
but matches buyers and sellers and is this massive logistical enterprise,

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
but whose real function as a social economy is the production, is the calculation and the computational calculation of a price

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
and then the logistical mechanism for the deliverance of this, yes, yes, yes, that's exactly what we mean.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
And this is also then I think part of where maybe the interest discussion is that some of the more conventional Cold War left-right distinctions

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
of what is planned, what's not planned, what's centralized, what's decentralized

16:03.000 --> 16:12.000
don't line up real well when we actually sort of investigate these processes that we're talking about

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
as technical systems and as institutional systems.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
So in any event, that's my long answer to your simple question about what is synthetic catalectics.

16:23.000 --> 16:31.000
That means we do indeed have synthetic catalectics, even though these are up until today capitalist ones.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
I am very much interested in the possibilities of synthetic catalectics to come.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
And I would like to build a bridge actually between a proposal by one of my other guests, Daniel E. Seros,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
and your analysis of what you have called platform of platforms.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
And you actually described Amazon as such a platform already.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
I think what Dan Seros describes in his book Information Technology and Socialist Construction

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
indeed is a different kind of proposal for a platform of platforms.

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
And I think it absolutely confirms an intuition you have articulated in the stack about how governance,

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
namely planning and programming, and I quote here, may be situated at if not originate from the interface layer.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
There's a lot to unpack here. Let's do this step by step and start with a definition of platforms.

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
What are platforms and what could a platform of platforms that is different from those that we already have look like?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, it could look like it could look lots of things.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
The platform, as I model it in the stack and discuss it in the stack,

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
I don't mean it in a way to sort of evangelize platforms or to argue that platforms are in themselves good or bad or whatever,

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
but rather to try to make the argument on behalf of, you know,

17:52.000 --> 18:00.000
for a kind of future old political science or economics or indeed international relations or computer science

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
and most likely the way in which those approaches would need to kind of converge and understand each other a bit more,

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
particularly the computer science and political science.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
To understand platforms not just as a kind of technical arrangement, but as an institutional form as well

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
and one that has logics that are different than states, that are different than markets,

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
that their political structure is different and indeed their economic structure is different.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
So whereas a platform in the simplest sense can be understood as a kind of a set of generic,

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
a kind of a set of generic schematic arrangements that allows for the organization

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
of other forms of conditional participation within that schema to interoperate with one another

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
in ways that wouldn't have been possible without their participation within that platform.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
And so the platform in this way has the capacity to, as a kind of translation mechanism,

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
a capacity as a kind of scaffolding system by which different kinds of actions and actors and participants

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
can organize in relationship to one another.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
So lots of technical definitions of platforms.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
One of my PhD students, Stephanie Shermans, currently writing a book on the kind of early history of platforms

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
in the industrial era with an emphasis on Fordism.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
So it's also, I think, important to say just for your listeners that when we're talking about platforms,

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
we're not just talking about things like Airbnb and Uber and these contemporary versions of platforms

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
that, for example, Nick Terncheck writes about in Platform Capitalism,

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
where Nick is focusing on sort of the sort of contemporary face of many of these platforms.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
We can also think of platforms going back to the beginning of the urban grid as a kind of platform.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
Some would argue even the tetrahedral body plan as a kind of platform.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
But the platform as an organizational and technical logic has a historical scope

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
that precedes computation and precedes planetary scale computation.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
But it's one in which the planetary scale computations, we define it,

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
never would have happened if it was not organized through, as we understand it,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
never would have happened if it wasn't organized through platforms.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So we can talk about things like the search engine as a kind of platform

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
in that a search engine doesn't make any of the content that's on the Internet.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
It simply organizes the content that other people put on the Internet in such a way that in theory

20:39.000 --> 20:46.000
it makes that content more valuable both for the producer and the receiver of that content.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
So you put your website or your photos or whatever on the platform,

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
there's now thousands or if not millions of people who will see this information,

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
which in a way somehow makes it that now those items are more valuable for you

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
because you've placed them on the platform.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
They're more valuable for the receiver to place on the platform.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
And so this is all obviously in theory.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
But here's that key idea around the economic difference

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
and where they differentiate from states and markets.

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
If states reproduce themselves, are able to in essence pay for their provision of public services

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
primarily through taxation, that they identify kind of choke points within value chains

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
such as a port or where goods are coming in and out or something.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
And they identify these kinds of choke points within value chains

21:43.000 --> 21:52.000
and then they absorb some of the value from these choke points in the form of taxation,

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
which then pays for the long-term provision of the public services that made the production of that value possible

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
in the first place and so on and so forth.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
But it's through taxation in essence that they reproduce themselves.

22:02.000 --> 22:10.000
Whereas corporations in the normal way of understanding them as capitalist structures

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
reproduce themselves through commodities and transactions,

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
that you produce a commodity, you pay charge more for the commodity

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
and there's difference in this surplus between the two in the form of profit

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
constitutes this ability for the corporation to reproduce itself.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Platforms don't work either way.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
They don't tax you and they don't charge you.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
So how do they work?

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
They work fundamentally through the rationalization of the information

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
that populates the platform in such a way that that information becomes more valuable

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
for the users of the platform.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
It rationalizes the information that populates the platform

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
such that that information becomes more valuable for the users of the platform.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
And that differential between, let's say, the value of the information before it's concluded

23:02.000 --> 23:09.000
and after it's included in the platform is the basis of how they reproduce themselves.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Currently, many of those are then dependent upon

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
a sort of a secondary dependence market upon advertising.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
But I would argue that that's sort of a contingent arrangement

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
that you can have and indeed have had lots of platforms

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
that are, that produce, that actually reproduce themselves

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
from many other kinds of ways besides that.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
So first of all, just as a sort of a definitional basis of platforms

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
from the basis of our discussion.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
So a platform of platforms, as you've asked me sort of here as well,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
would refer to some other kind of meta-infrastructural mechanism

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
that allows for multiple platforms to interoperate with each other.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
And so you can think of it a bit as a kind of first order platforms

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
that are structuring and scaffolding structural systems

24:07.000 --> 24:13.000
that allow for the rationalization of information that's included in them.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
And then you can imagine sort of an aggregation of multiple platforms

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
that in essence allows the platforms themselves to interoperate with one another

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
in such a way that they have this, in principle that you have an even more,

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
that you have other kinds of deliberate or emergent effects

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
situated one way or another.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Now, to the question about the interface layer that you asked

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
about where the politics sits within this.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I think in many ways the politics of the platforms

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
is situated in many different places.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And all the different points of description that I've argued here

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
are all places that are ones that are interesting

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
because they mediate power in some kind of way,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
that they are relevant, platforms are relevant as social technologies

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
because they organize power in some way.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
To me this isn't a reason to exclude them,

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
but rather to in essence to be interested in them

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
and to try to understand how they can function as means

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
for collective reason and societal self-composition.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
And to be quite concerned about the ways in which they

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
are not living up to that assignment today

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
because we should expect that of them.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
And because they may not be doing so today

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
it's possible to criticize them for this fact

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
because indeed this is something that should be expected of them.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
The question of the interface layer,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
the interface layer as I defined it has to do really with,

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
the interface layer is the semiotic layer within the system

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
that allows for the translation between users that are participating

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
in the larger system and that system itself.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
So in the simplest sense you're using your computer,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
you're seeing all the buttons with words on them on the screen.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Of all of the possible things you could do with your computer,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
of all the possible things your computer could do

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
now that it's connected to the internet,

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
all of those trillions and trillions and trillions of possibilities

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
are reduced to a composable array of several dozen menu items

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
that you can sort of choose between.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
That map reduction of all of those possibilities

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
into this composable array of menu functions

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
is unavoidably ideological, is unavoidably political

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
if you want to think of it in those terms,

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
constriction or collapse of the space of possibilities

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
into a range of options.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I would also argue though in a certain sense

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
that this is to a certain sense unavoidable as well

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
in that it has, when I call it a map reduction,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
this is exactly what it is.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
In the same way in which you don't want a map of your city

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
that is one-to-one with your city,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
you don't want a map of the city

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
that includes absolutely everything in your city on it

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
and would be in essence the most accurate map possible of your city.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
You want a map that only includes,

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
that gets rid of 99% of everything that's there,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
that only shows you that 1% that might be the most relevant

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
for the purposes of the abstractions of navigation.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Interface layer functions in a similar way.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
It's a kind of reductive abstraction of the space

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
of the vectors of navigation through the space.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
And because of this function of simplification,

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
it also allows for the network effects of the millions of people

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
for whom this map is legible to actually use the system,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
to participate in the system, to generate value for the system,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
to have value generated for them from the system

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
because of its simplification and its arrangement

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
in the same way in which a simple map

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
makes the city navigable for more people.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
On the one hand, you can see this as having a kind of democratizing effect,

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
but there's a political valence of that.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
There's a political valence in the map reduction problem itself

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and the ideological constraint.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
There's also a political function of this

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
in that in the network's effects of participation,

28:32.000 --> 28:41.000
you have the kinds of aggregations of user participants in such a way

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
that they themselves enter into social relations

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
that they wouldn't have been able to do so otherwise.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
So we're still kind of setting the groundwork, I think,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
for maybe the meat of our discussion,

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
but if that's helpful in terms of kind of the definitional terms

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
for how from not just a computer science perspective,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
but indeed from a sociological theory or economics or political science perspective,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
how it is that we can understand the terms of these interrelations

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
and what is specific about platforms,

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
what is generic about platforms in terms of how they function in these ways,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
then perhaps that's helpful.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Yes, absolutely.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
This is super helpful, I guess,

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
and it's super important that we get to understand this in a different form.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
And you have already touched upon how...

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I'm sorry, your question was about what other kinds of platforms could happen.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
So the reason I answer in this way is that defining platforms in this...

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
I first would say there's lots of kinds of platforms that only could happen.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
I want to point your listeners' attention also historically

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
to look at all of the kind of histories of platforms that in fact have preceded us

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
and to understand some of the structures there.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
So I'm sorry, please go ahead.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
No, I just wanted to say that we already touched upon

30:05.000 --> 30:12.000
how this idea of platform of platforms might be able to address

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
what has been called the socialist calculation problem

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
or the socialist pricing problem, you call it.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
But in your texts you also point that it might be able to solve

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
the capitalist pricing problem.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And maybe let's just point out what that is

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
and how a platform of platforms might be able to address this one.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
Sure. Yeah, and there's lots of other pricing problems as well

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
besides just those two.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
In some respects, I think we may want to...

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
Going forward, I think we'll probably want to open up the space of possibilities

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
beyond this sort of simple Cold War dynamic of that as well.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
But yeah, to your point, I argue in the book that in many ways

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
it's the capitalist pricing...

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The capitalist pricing problem, as I call it,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
that it maybe is the more pressing issue now.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
So if through whatever bending arcs of historical irony

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
it ended up being Walmart and Amazon that proved that Hayek was wrong

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
and that the socialist cybernauticians were right

31:21.000 --> 31:27.000
and that these big capitalist companies solved the socialist pricing problem

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
in whatever strange way,

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
the capitalist pricing problem, as I define it,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
really has to do in terms of...

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
is a way of thinking about pricing systems

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
in relationship to negative externalities.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
And in a larger sense, I see this as part of the question

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
of the more important question of

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
ultimately what is planetary scale computation for?

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
If the stack was a book that was about

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
what is planetary scale computation and how does it work,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
the next book is really more trying to speak to this question again.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
What is planetary scale computation for?

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
How do we would see it in longer historical terms

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
and maybe even in geologic terms,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
in sort of anthropocene scale kinds of terms.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
What does it mean now that it's possible for human societies

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
and indeed human societies to calculate their own,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
to model and calculate their own processes

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
with such speed and clarity,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
but also in many ways how it's possible for,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
if you think of the entire apparatus itself,

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
of the satellite systems, the transoceanic cables,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
the data centers, this entire planet,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
this entire kind of artificial crust

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
that we have produced around the surface of the planet,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
what it means for also to create for a planet

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
to be able to model itself and act back upon itself

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
with such sophistication.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
How do we understand this even in geological terms

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
in terms of the arc and history of the planet?

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
And so there's some questioning then

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
of how to locate the question of planetary scale computation

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
within some of the philosophical questionings

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
after planetarity itself and how this would function.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Now, to the question of the capitalist pricing problem,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
back to this, the capitalist pricing problem,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
as I define it, and again, it's rather schematic,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
has to do with the negative externalities

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
within economic transactions

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
and this trying to locate the question of economics,

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
the ontology of economics within that of ecology more broadly.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Excuse me.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
So the question of the ontology of economics,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
that is, what is value? What is valuable?

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
And how can something be identified as valuable

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
in whatever sense is, in theory, represented within the price?

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
That if there is, in theory, 10 euros of value within this item,

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
that the price of this will be 10 euros,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
and that the capacity for calculation,

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
the markets to calculate this or central computer to calculate this,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
that there is some either correspondence

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
between the price and the underlying value

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
or distortion of correspondence

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
between the price and the underlying value.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
And so for Hayek, the socialist pricing problem

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
represented a distortion of value

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
in that it could never really know

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
whether something was overpriced or underpriced

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
because it couldn't calculate it fast enough.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
What many of those, it's not my idea,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
but many of those working in fields of ecological economics

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
have identified is that there's a different kind of distortion

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
that's happening within the market price

34:54.000 --> 35:02.000
in that there are underlying social and ecological costs

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
to the production and transaction and consumption of commodities

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
that are not reflected in the price.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
These are called negative externalities.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
They would include, so if that $100 barrel of oil,

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
if it costs $100 because the amount that's available

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
on the world market at any point in time

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
would suggest that this is the price of it,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
what that price signal does not include, for example,

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
are the immediate and or long-term costs of burning that oil,

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
of releasing that, of liberating that carbon into the atmosphere,

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
and the costs of its ramifications,

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
whether those are immediate health costs

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
or long-term subtraction costs.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
We were having a lot of discussions with colleagues

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
around negative emissions technologies

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
and the need for not only the decarbonization,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
not putting more carbon into the atmosphere,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
but the subtraction of existing carbon from the atmosphere

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
in order to keep it 2 degrees Celsius.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
The real question of this is how do you pay for it?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Well, part of the reason you can't pay for it

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
is because the cost of the production of that carbon

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
in the first place was not reflected

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
in the price signal of the oil that produced that carbon

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
in its first instance, as you see.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
And so this represents a distortion of the pricing.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
The question then for going to this question

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
of what planetary scale computation is for

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
is to ask the question is,

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
would it be possible to undistort this signal?

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
Would it be possible for there to be a price signal

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
that was in essence not distorted in this way?

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
It would have to be a price signal where, for example,

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
the price of that barrel of oil would somehow be able to count,

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
be inclusive of not just the transactional value,

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
but ultimately all of the secondary and tertiary costs

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
and value that would be associated with that item,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
such that it would be the cost of the barrel of mine

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
being $500 a barrel or $1,500 a barrel,

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
if that's what it would cost to actually deal with this.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Now, what I sort of hypothesize in the book a bit

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
more of as a thought experiment

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
than as a policy recommendation

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
is to ask them what you would need then is some ability

37:36.000 --> 37:43.000
for some kind of economics calculative substrate

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
that was able not just to identify

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
the immediate transactional relations,

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
but to hypothesize a futural value of that,

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
to imagine in the future what the cost of that would be

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
that has not happened yet.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
So you burn the barrel of oil in the future

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
that will be these costs that are associated with it

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
in the form of negative externalities,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
but how much is that for one barrel of oil

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
or for 10 barrels of oil or for one bicycle

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
or for one lunch or for one whatever?

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
There would be a future cost that hasn't happened yet.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
There would have to be a way, in essence, to price the future.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
How would you calculate the pricing of the future

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
into the transaction in some kind of way?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
So this sort of led us to some of the questions

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
about the ways in which planetary scale computation

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
has already been used as a method for futural modeling

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
and the production of models of the future

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
that can or should have some recursive capacity

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
to govern the present.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And that's really what I think this question

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
of the capitalist pricing,

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
the de-distortion of the capitalist pricing

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
that it comes down to,

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
how can objective empirical statistically valid models

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
of the future govern the present in some kind of way?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
So that includes, there's a lot of other discussions

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
about just the general capacities of prospection,

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
of how it is that the predictive structures of the future

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
as part of human cognition play into this,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
the ways in which the kind of preemptive logics

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
of the biopolitics of planetary scale computation

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
play into this.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
But we were looking at basically two things.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
One was climate science.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
And one of the, I think the key points for this

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
is that I make the argument that climate change itself,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
not the physical geophysical fact of climate change,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
but the concept of climate change,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
the statistical regularity that the earth is warming,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
is itself an epistemological accomplishment

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
of planetary scale computation.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
That without this sensing, calculation, simulation,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
modeling apparatus of planetary scale computation,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
the very idea of climate change as a kind of

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
reductive statistical regularity of a hockey stick arc

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
of all of the things that are going on in the planet

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
could not be possible.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
And one of the things, it wasn't possible to calculate.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
This is a better example of what planetary scale computation

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
is for, if you ask me, and a different kind of model

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
of its ultimate social, technical,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
and ecological potential.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
But it's also one that is based on this,

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
of a kind of a temporal and historical differential

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
between the past and the future.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
It's used not only to mark a present moment,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
but also to sample moments in the past

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
through ice core sampling or other kinds of things

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
to try to understand the kind of the calculus,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
the statistical differential arc of this

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
over a long period of time,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
and also to produce valid computational simulations

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
of what the next 10 years, or 20 years,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
or 30 years, or 40 years are being like.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
And so when we look at all the IPCC scenarios,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and they're forking into the future,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
depending on what happens,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
these are computational simulations

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
dependent upon different presumptions and first principles.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
But they are models of the future that we can

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
and should be using to govern the present.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
That's what climate science is going to do for it.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And so this is one example by which, yes,

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
we can imagine ways in which we have models of the future

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
that we wish to have recursively come back

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
and model the present.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
The other one, a bit more prosaic that we've been

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
experimenting with is around, of all things, insurance.

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
Insurance is another way in which the future is priced,

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
and that it's priced in a way that acts back upon

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
the changes, the price signal of something we do in the present.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
So if you're, one of my favorite magazines of all time

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
is a magazine called Schaden Spiegel.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
It's the magazine of the German Reinsurance Agency.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
It's basically like disaster monthly,

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
but it also has some of the most amazingly sober

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
descriptions of the implications of climate change

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
on large-scale infrastructure that you'll be able to find anywhere.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Because they're the ones on the hook for a lot of this,

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
ultimately, of where this would go.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
And so if you wanted to build that piece of infrastructure,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
not only does it need to be insured,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
but the insurance company needs to get reinsurance against it.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
And if the reinsurance company realizes that that thing

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
is going to be extremely vulnerable to climate irregularities,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
you can't get it insured.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Or if you get it insured, the price of doing it now

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
is going to be so much higher because that insurance policy

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
will be so expensive that it actually changes the price signal

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
of whether we should build that infrastructure thing in the first place.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
So you see where I'm going with this.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
That if you can actually think about what the long-term climatic ramifications

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
of some kind of action or investment would be in the future,

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
such that those negative externalities are not only not excluded

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
from the price, but are formed the basis of the model

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
by which the price is produced in the first place.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
Then you go some distance towards at least de-distorting

43:24.000 --> 43:30.000
that initial price signal in such a way that you have a transformation

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
to some extent what we even mean by price in the first place.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
You introduce a different temporality to economic ontology,

43:40.000 --> 43:46.000
and that what constitutes value is being produced

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
in relationship to not only future value in the same way

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
as stock price is related to future value,

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
but also related to future costs in ways in which that are inclusive in this.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
This is a bit what we mean by that idea.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
Obviously, some of the open questions here is how total of a system

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
is necessary for this to work.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
Is there a way in which does this have to be entirely some sort

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
of massively centralized mechanism, but through which other forms

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
of valuation can't escape, or is there some kind of way

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
in which even the organized participation

44:32.000 --> 44:40.000
within a kind of economics of this sort that is futureal in this way,

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
that is inclusive of what are present externalities in some sort of way,

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
is there some kind of way that participation on this can be incentivized

44:53.000 --> 45:00.000
in a way in which it itself becomes a kind of catalytic institution,

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
a kind of bottom-up institution rather than necessarily one

45:04.000 --> 45:11.000
that requires some kind of Skynet system to enforce itself.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
I think that's kind of an open question,

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
which means that in a certain way we're back to where we started.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Is that if all of this started in a debate between is it possible to have,

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
can we only have bottom-up organization of this and will it work itself out,

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
or do we need some kind of centralized top-down piloting function

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
to make all of this work properly?

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
If that's where this argument started in the 1950s,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
even when we're talking about how you incentivize participation

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
within this situation I described,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
that question doesn't present itself as already solved.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
This is super interesting and I think there's a different layer to it,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
which is quite important as well,

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
because actually I think what you're kind of saying is that

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
the future is already priced, but it could be priced much better.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
And this kind of stays within the realm of pricing the future

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
and argues for better models and the incorporation of externalities

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
specifically into the question of pricing.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
For example, yes.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
But there is a different level,

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
and maybe this is the homo sapiens level at the end,

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
there's a different level to this.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
And Evgeny Morozov writes about it in his essay

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
in the New Left Review on Digital Socialism,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
and I'd like to quote him here,

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
When Austrian economists respond to today's defenders of central planning

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
by noting that any non-capitalist system,

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
even one rooted in the power of big data,

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
could only beat the efficiency of the price system

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
if it also created new behavioral modes and frameworks of meaning,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
they have a point.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I think this is super important

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
and I think it's relevant for what you just said as well,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
and at least in two key aspects,

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
it's relevant for the question of synthetic catalectsies to come,

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
specifically if they are embedded in some form of red futurism.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
The first one would be, and this is implicit in Morozov's quote,

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
that prices are not just numerical, but social,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
and that it is therefore not enough to find a different method

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
of quantification or weighing.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
So this would kind of mean that it's not enough

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
to price the future even better,

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
because there's still the question of new behavioral modes

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
and frameworks of meaning,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
which are kind of an obstacle and a chance, I guess.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
And the second one is that markets are not equal to capital

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
and that capital does not necessarily need markets,

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
and that therefore the force of capital as such

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
would need to be abolished if one wanted to be serious

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
about synthetic catalectsies as red futurism.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
And this is a specific form, you know?

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
So I think those are probably two questions,

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
and maybe if I just, so I can keep them in my mind at once,

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
maybe we ask them, I'll try to answer them one at a time,

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
and maybe you can ask me the second one again after this as well.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
So I would say that I don't disagree,

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
I probably don't disagree essentially with the point that

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
that simply another,

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
just a different means of calculating price

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
about the same thing would be sufficient.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
What I'm calling a kind of a shift in economic ontology

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
goes to that question of what value is

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
and what is even being priced in the first place.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
So it's not just when we're talking about a barrel of oil,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
it's not just this particular assemblage of molecules

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
that is transacting owners,

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
but it's understood to be a whole other set

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
of past, present, and future dynamics

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
that one has illegal liability in its relationship to

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
that becomes part of the price.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
And I think another way in which this goes back to this question

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
of insurance and another future thing,

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
part of the question about price has to do with,

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
and another kind of externality is a political externality

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
in that it is the institutions that allow in essence

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
for the renunciation of liability in relationship to something.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
And you can just think, I mean, in the simplest possible sense,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
think of this in terms of like trash.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
So like you've got something in your house

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
and you put it out in the garbage can

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
and like someone comes along and takes it and says,

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
well, this isn't yours anymore

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
because you put it in the trash, right?

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
And somehow in the act of like getting rid of it,

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
you're not only renouncing property claims over it,

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
you're also renouncing liability claims over it as well, right?

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
And so part of the process of the reason

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
why negative externalities can even work in this way

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
is because we have this magic function

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
by which the renunciation of private property

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
constitutes the renunciation of liability.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
So I can spew all of the carbon dioxide

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
into the atmosphere once I want.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
And once it's sort of above the airspace property line

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
of my factory, it's no longer my carbon dioxide,

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
and therefore I'm no longer liable for this carbon dioxide.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
So you see the point about this renunciation of liability

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
in this space as well.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Now, what I'm talking about as the shift

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
of a kind of economic ontology has to do some ways

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
in which that magic function of renunciation of liability

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
and renunciation of sort of embeddedness

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
within these socio-molecular relations

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
is not something that can be so easily renounced,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
that is in fact part of what you're buying

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
when you enter into the relations

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
with that barrel of oil in the first place.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
So that is part of what I mean.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
So that is a bit where it seems like

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
I probably agree with Evgeny in the sense to which

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
it's not just a matter of finding another mechanism

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
by which we measure the same thing.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
It's a matter of changing

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
what we're measuring in the first place.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
But where I would say, where it may be disagree,

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
when he says something like,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
I think your line was a measure,

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
it's not just a matter of measuring and calculating

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
something but rather something else

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
because these have social relations.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I think my point is that measuring and calculating

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
are social relations.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
What he's saying is it can't just be

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
these measuring things because it's social.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I'm saying that is in fact what the social is.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
Measuring things and calculating things and weighing things

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
not only have social functions,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
they are social functions.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
They are sort of the key social functions

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
as part of this whole kind of dynamic as well.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
And so it is for sure something that needs to go deeper

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
into this question of how we identify

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
not only how we value the thing

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
but what the thing is in the first place.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
So agreed.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Now whether or not this constitutes

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
a kind of behavioral change, it would.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
It's a matter of, it's an open question though

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I think whether or not the behavioral

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
and psychological transformation would be the cause

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
or the effect.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And honestly there's sort of different approaches

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
and schools of thought to this.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
And this probably goes to a more deeper

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
sort of approaches to ecological politics

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
and indeed just the kind of dynamics in general.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
For those whose alliance,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
whose those sort of like way of seeing the world

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
is one in which large scale change happens

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
through the accumulation of virtuous acts.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
That if enough people do enough virtuous acts

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
and those virtuous acts assemble into millions and billions

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
and trillions of virtuous acts,

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
then there will be an infrastructural transformation

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
will ensue through this deliberate conscious

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
psychological moral shift in paradigmatic worldview

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
and then the accumulation of virtuous acts.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
And then there's others.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
And I would be on the second side of this a bit more

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
that would suggest in many ways the history of technology

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and the history of society are not only intertwined

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
with one another, but in many respects,

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
shifts in social systems and in cultural systems

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and indeed in political and economic systems

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
usually happen more as an effect of transformations

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
within underlying technological systems.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
This is in a certain sense

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
based a superstructure kind of approach

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
that in transformations not just in the means of production,

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
but indeed in the mode of production

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
that you then see shifts in culture

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
and shifts in psychology as a result of these.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
And so I think in many respects,

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
my inclination would be to look at ways

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
in which you'll get greater leverage faster

54:19.000 --> 54:24.000
by looking at ways in which there would be shifts

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
in geotechnology and shifts in geoeconomics

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
that would bring about shifts in geoculture

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
rather than trying to bring about a spiritual transformation

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
that would subsequently down the line

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
transform those geotechnologies.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
It's really not because of an aesthetic preference

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
of this so much, but rather than just,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I think that the history of economics

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
and the history of technology suggest

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
that that's the more likely path.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
But at least as far as I understand it,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
the question that he's aiming at when he's saying

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
new behavioral modes and frameworks of meaning,

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
it's more about what are the crucial points

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
that are not only concerned with these technical aspects

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
of, for example, how to price the future any better

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
because these ideas of externalities

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
and how you can behave with your property,

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
this is ingrained in the very concept of property as such.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
So if you are not able to change this idea of property

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
as a form of behavioral mode and a framework of meaning,

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
then you won't get to a point where you will be effective

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
in bringing people to a point of not treating it

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
as an externality.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Do you see what I mean?

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
I think there's a way of approaching it

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
from the perspective of, okay, we need to find

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
a more effective pricing mechanism for these externalities,

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
or we need to find a way to address this social institution

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
of property as such because the property as such,

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
as a social institution and a framework of meaning,

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
is one of the root causes for the ways we do address

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
these questions on a large scale.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
And this is not coming from a moral perspective,

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
but as well from a perspective of effectiveness, I guess.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Possibly.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I agree with you everything up to the point of the phrase

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
root cause.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
I see it as root effect.

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
I completely agree with you that ultimately you can't have

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
one without the other.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I don't argue with this at all.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
If there is a changing in somehow, even at the level

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
of some shift in the geotechnology of pricing

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
and organization and the ontology of property

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
that has some kind of planetary scale legal binding structure,

56:58.000 --> 57:05.000
if this isn't, in fact, become part of the culture

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
of our relationship to object and molecular assemblages

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
around us and our socioeconomic environment,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
if it doesn't actually become a social infrastructure

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
and doesn't actually become the basis of the way

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
in which we plan, conceptualize, model,

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
and recursively organize our relationship

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
to the material world, then it's nothing.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
It's not even a technology because it's not being used.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
There's no argument.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I absolutely agree.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
And then part of the question is, how is it

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
that at societal levels that the kind of models

57:44.000 --> 57:50.000
that we have, cognitive models, at an individual level

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
and at a group level, cognitive models that understand

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
and calculate advantage, calculate the future,

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
calculate our interests, calculate our interactions

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
with these kinds of things are done so in relationship

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
to these differential systems.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
If that isn't part of how we are rethinking the world,

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
then these technologies are, in fact, not even technologies.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
I would agree with that because they're not

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
being used in this way.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
What I'm simply suggesting is that there is a presumption,

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
and I think, honestly, I think it's one that's rather deep

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
in a Western liberal individualist framework,

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
that first there is a cognitive psychological transformation

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
that then is made manifest upon the world,

58:42.000 --> 58:48.000
that somehow the agency and subjectivity are the same thing,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
that our agency in the world is ultimately

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
a function of our subjectivity.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
And what I'm suggesting, honestly, I think I'm making

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
more of a Marxian argument that in many ways

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
that the transformations in the mode of production,

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
and I would include these shifts in economic ontology

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
as a shift in the mode of production,

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
ultimately transforms the culture in its image more so.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
You can't have one without the other,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
but in terms of where it is that we should,

59:18.000 --> 59:24.000
where I would place my bet, now speaking of the future,

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
so placing my bet on which is more a cause of the other,

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
I'm going to vote that base causes superstructure

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
more than superstructure causes base.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Nice, super nice.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
I love this answer, and it already touches upon

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
one of the next questions which is concerned with the individual.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
This has been the first part of the Future Histories Live event

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
with Benjamin Bretton.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
I hope you enjoyed it, I certainly did.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
If you want to support Future Histories,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
then you can do so via Patreon or through a simple donation.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And if you're not able to support Future Histories economically,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
then this is absolutely fine,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
because there is a fantastic money-free way

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
to support the project too,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and that is by telling a friend about the show

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
who might be interested in the topics we discuss here.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Thank you all, and hear you in two weeks.
