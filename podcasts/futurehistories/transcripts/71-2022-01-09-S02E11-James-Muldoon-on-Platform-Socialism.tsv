0	8000	Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome James Muldoon in today's episode.
8000	12000	James is a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter.
12000	17000	He is a leading autonomy digital at the British think tank Autonomy,
17000	24000	and he is the author of Platform Socialism, How to Reclaim Our Digital Futures from Big Tech.
24000	27000	A quick note towards my German listeners.
27000	37000	This is the second English episode in a row, which is highly unusual since Future Histories is a predominantly German language podcast.
37000	43000	Normally, I try to have not more than every 10th episode or so in English,
43000	49000	but this was simply too perfect and so I couldn't resist because last episode,
49000	58000	I had the pleasure of welcoming Aaron Bannonoff to talk about associational socialism and democratic planning.
58000	62000	And today's episode couldn't be a better follow up.
62000	69000	James thinking on Platform Socialism presents some very concrete ideas on how we could build alternative infrastructures
69000	77000	that aim at fulfilling all of our needs in a much better way than the capitalist variants of today.
77000	82000	Before we start, I'd like to thank Lucas and Fabian for their kind donations.
82000	87000	And I would like to point all of you to the collaborative transcription effort
87000	92000	that is trying to make future histories accessible for people who are deaf.
92000	96000	And by doing so, also making the content searchable.
96000	98000	This is absolutely brilliant.
98000	102000	And my warmest thanks go out to everybody involved.
102000	107000	You'll find a contact mail in the show notes so you can join in the effort too.
107000	108000	Many thanks.
108000	114000	And now please enjoy today's episode with James Muldoon on Platform Socialism.
120000	121000	Welcome, James.
121000	122000	It's great to be here.
122000	123000	Thanks for having me.
123000	124000	It's a pleasure.
124000	127000	James, let's start with some definitions.
127000	129000	How do you define platforms?
129000	131000	How do you define socialism?
131000	135000	And finally, what is platform socialism?
135000	138000	Okay, well, that's a really great place to start.
138000	145000	I think the best thing is to start with how platforms tend to operate in a capitalist economy.
145000	151000	So I think at their core, most digital platforms are what I would call value capture devices.
151000	158000	They exist to appropriate in some way the value creating activities of those who use them.
158000	163000	So in a platform business, the company isn't necessarily going to sell you a good or a service.
163000	169000	They're going to position themselves as a middleman who gets paid every time a transaction
169000	174000	or something takes place on the platform, either through data or a direct fee.
174000	176000	So, of course, there are exceptions to this.
176000	180000	You have things like Amazon Web Services that are just kind of selling you a service.
180000	184000	You have companies like Apple that are just selling you consumer products.
184000	190000	But the real power of platforms comes when they can act as this gatekeeper
190000	194000	and charge people for connecting with each other to rent accommodation,
194000	197000	I don't know, to order food, to hail a ride.
197000	201000	That's, I think, when you start to see this exponential increase in profits.
201000	208000	So the ambition of lots of these really big global platforms is to expand
208000	212000	until they can become the very infrastructure upon which we live our lives.
213000	219000	And as we spend more of our time online and as more of our lives become digitized,
219000	223000	these platforms simply become the social infrastructure of everyday life.
223000	227000	So every time we do anything, the platform takes a cut.
227000	233000	And so if you look at Facebook's recent turn to the metaverse as an example,
233000	239000	you can really see that the platform or this platform has these world building ambitions.
239000	243000	The whole idea of the metaverse is that there would be this hybrid online
243000	247000	and offline world that would be corporate owned and controlled
247000	251000	and that everything you do in this world could potentially be monetized.
251000	256000	So Facebook, which is now meta, doesn't want to be like simply an option
256000	259000	or a service that you choose.
259000	263000	They want to own the world within which choices are made available to you.
263000	266000	They don't want to just sell an advertising product.
266000	270000	They want to find new ways to monetize everything that you do online.
270000	275000	So if you want to be more precise, like talking about platforms,
275000	281000	you do have to admit that platform can incorporate a whole variety of different business models.
281000	285000	So you have advertising platforms like Google and the old Facebook
285000	287000	that are primarily just selling advertising products.
287000	291000	You have transaction platforms like Uber and Deliveroo and others.
292000	296000	You have streaming platforms, cultural production platforms,
296000	299000	but there are some similarities in how they operate.
299000	304000	And I think all of it is about how you capture value from the platform.
304000	306000	I think this is what's really essential.
306000	311000	What you might say, well, don't many of these platforms actually create value?
311000	315000	Many of them are very popular with customers.
315000	320000	Some of them provide really useful and convenient services that people quite like.
320000	323000	I think this is also true to an extent.
323000	328000	So one of the benefits of transaction platforms like Uber, for example,
328000	331000	is that they make it easier for people to find service providers
331000	334000	and for service providers to find clients.
334000	339000	And they actually do solve a lot of trust problems through some of the rating systems.
339000	345000	So you can say that the platform does add value by bringing these people together in this way.
345000	349000	And I think this is one of the aspects of digital platforms
349000	353000	that I think we can harness for more socially useful ends
353000	358000	because the goal of platform companies is going to be to make more money
358000	363000	by positioning themselves as these obligatory passing points in social networks.
363000	367000	And I think you need to ask, well, where's the true source of the value?
367000	374000	Is it a relatively simple bit of technology that connects us or is it our activity, our labor?
374000	376000	And I think here's the point, right?
376000	381000	Because platforms, insofar as they operate within this capitalist framework,
381000	386000	are essentially parasitic on our activity, on our social lives.
386000	390000	They have value capture mechanisms because ultimately it's the communities
390000	396000	and the community's activity that's creating the majority of the value for them.
396000	399000	And how do you define socialism?
399000	403000	So for me, I mean, and the tradition that I come from,
403000	407000	I understand socialism as the struggle for freedom.
407000	413000	So freedom is the kind of, and I think that is kind of the kind of classic definition.
413000	418000	It's about liberating people, or rather it's about people liberating themselves
418000	421000	from the main sources of domination under capitalism,
421000	426000	which tend to stem from an unequal distribution of resources
426000	430000	and people's lack of control over their work, over their lives,
430000	434000	precisely because they don't have access to these.
434000	437000	So socialism as a movement, as a political project,
437000	444000	is about how we could expand people's freedom by institutionalizing, you know,
444000	447000	forms of economic security, access to resources,
447000	452000	and obviously very importantly about establishing democratic controls
452000	456000	over workplaces and over economic institutions.
456000	461000	So I think capitalism offers a certain illusion of this freedom,
461000	465000	but it turns out to be a kind of freedom that's only really available
465000	467000	to a very small group of people.
467000	470000	And I think the promise there is that, you know, if you work hard,
470000	476000	if you are successful in your life, you can have access to this small elite group.
476000	480000	But the problem is this leaves most of us relatively powerless,
480000	484000	subject to the whims of bad bosses and, you know,
484000	488000	impersonal market forces that dictate a lot of things about our lives.
488000	494000	So when I think of socialism, it's both something like incredibly boring
494000	496000	and mundane, but also very exciting.
496000	500000	I think it has this boring side, which is just about, you know,
500000	505000	a socialist society is one that should be providing adequate resources
505000	507000	for people to live a dignified life.
507000	510000	You know, people should have access to housing, to health care,
510000	514000	to job opportunities, to really well-functioning public services,
514000	516000	to culture and art.
516000	521000	I think this is really the bare minimum for what we should be struggling for,
521000	524000	you know, the basic program of something like a social democracy.
524000	528000	But for me, the exciting part of it is also what happens after this,
528000	531000	what happens when people have that feeling of security.
531000	534000	They feel like they can participate in their society.
534000	539000	They can play an active role in shaping some of the main social institutions
539000	541000	in which they participate.
541000	545000	And so the goal isn't just about getting food on the table.
545000	549000	It's about enabling people to flourish, to live their best lives
549000	551000	and to do really amazing things.
551000	555000	So I think socialism should also be about creativity and excitement
555000	558000	and new projects and learning new things about the world.
558000	561000	And I think that's kind of like that idea of human flourishing
561000	566000	on top of those kind of necessities is also really important.
566000	570000	And I think mostly we don't get to talk about that side of things
570000	574000	because most of us are, you know, understandably caught up
574000	579000	in some of the daily struggles against the worst excesses of capitalism.
579000	584000	But when we talk about socialism as establishing some kind of social control
584000	588000	or social ownership over economic production,
588000	591000	so over businesses and workplaces, I think this,
591000	596000	we need to understand this as a means or as a pathway to enhancing our freedom.
596000	604000	It's the best way, you know, socialists argue to organize economic and social power
604000	609000	in a manner that avoids, you know, oligarchy and forms of capitalist domination.
609000	614000	So, yeah, social ownership over what Marxists would traditionally call
614000	618000	the means of production is about establishing a way for workers
618000	622000	to have a direct say in how their workplaces are organized,
622000	626000	but also about having forms of democratic accountability
626000	630000	over important decisions about the investment of resources
630000	633000	and how resources are best allocated.
633000	637000	So I think it's about balancing the needs of the community,
637000	640000	having these democratic controls over work,
640000	645000	and balancing these with the larger discussions about how to invest scarce resources.
645000	649000	Okay, so now we have a definition of socialism.
649000	652000	We have a definition of platforms.
652000	655000	James, what is platform socialism?
655000	659000	Platform socialism is a project for reinventing the internet
659000	662000	and reimagining how digital platforms could operate.
662000	668000	So it's about finding alternative ways to own and govern the organizations
668000	674000	that run digital platforms, particularly those that play such an essential role in our daily lives.
674000	681000	And what I really want to emphasize with platform socialism is this idea of imagination and invention,
681000	686000	because I think one of the saddest parts of our relationship with digital technology today
686000	692000	is that we often assume that there's only one way that the digital economy could be organized,
692000	696000	that there's a kind of technological determinism coming from big tech,
697000	700000	that tell us that this is how the tech operates.
700000	704000	This is the kind of social realities it must create.
704000	710000	Platform companies like Uber often tell us that if workers want the flexibility of working when they want,
710000	715000	then they have to accept the low pay, the insecurity, the precarity.
715000	717000	But one thing doesn't necessitate the other.
717000	721000	And I think technology is designed to achieve certain goals.
721000	727000	And we have to see it as embedded within broader socio-technical systems.
727000	733000	There are things that platforms and other forms of digital technology can do that are genuinely useful.
733000	739000	I think we can use things like the matchmaking services, some of the logistics operations,
739000	745000	without necessarily having this exploitative system that also degrades working conditions.
745000	748000	And so with this book, Platform Socialism,
748000	753000	what I'm interested in is trying to expand our collective imagination for what could be possible.
753000	757000	It's about drawing on histories of technology and politics,
757000	763000	but also looking at a range of contemporary prototypes and examples for how we could transform the digital economy.
763000	768000	So I think to do this and to have this project, we need an exciting vision.
768000	772000	We want to know what the world would look like with a better use of technology.
772000	781000	I don't think it's enough to simply dig our feet in and say no and refuse all of the latest inventions and ideas from the tech world.
781000	791000	I think we should be skeptical for sure, because most of the ideas are genuinely designed to be quite exploitative in how they operate.
791000	799000	But at the same time, I don't think we should let this skepticism degenerate into this just generalized cynicism
800000	809000	that assumes that we could never do any better, that our only response is one of refusal rather than appropriation or reinvention.
809000	818000	And when you think about some of the most transformative visions for what 2030, 2040 and beyond is going to look like,
818000	827000	ideas like the metaverse, virtual reality, all the stuff that's floating around at the moment, Web3, all the crypto blockchain stuff.
827000	831000	I mean, a lot of these visions and ideas are deeply flawed.
831000	839000	But I think there isn't really a very clear alternative for what the left think 2030 and 2040 should look like.
839000	845000	What should take their place? What is the left's big idea, either for the Internet or for digital platforms?
845000	851000	I think if you look back at every really successful, transformative leftist project,
851000	858000	these projects have come to power on the basis of a radical reimagining of how society should be organized.
858000	863000	I think the most successful ones offer this really inspiring vision and a bold agenda.
863000	869000	Things like universal suffrage, health care, abolitionism, racial equality.
869000	877000	These ideas were about creating this new common sense, a new kind of baseline for how we think the world should be organized.
878000	883000	And so platform socialism, it's about a struggle and it's about questions of control.
883000	891000	So not just what we achieve, but who gets to decide who has the power, who has control over these visions?
891000	897000	Because at the moment, it's just a bunch of tech executives and a handful of their designers.
897000	905000	And I think what we really need is communities themselves to have a much greater say in how new tech products are designed,
905000	909000	how they're going to be functioning in workplaces, in communities.
909000	914000	And I think this requires new kinds of institutions to facilitate these processes.
915000	918000	Awesome. I really love it, I have to say.
918000	925000	And I absolutely share this sentiment that we need new ideas of possible futures.
925000	931000	I mean, the subtitle of Future Histories in German is Der Podcast zur Erweiterung unserer Vorstellung von Zukunft,
931000	940000	which is kind of the podcast for the enlargement of our idea of the future, which is a messy translation, but something like that.
940000	948000	So I really, really enjoyed this part of your book specifically and the way that you kind of give us not only the ideas,
948000	953000	long-term ideas, but also concrete ideas of how to approach it in the here and now.
953000	956000	So you kind of have it both.
956000	963000	But before we dive deeper into your proposal or the different proposals actually that you bring forward,
963000	967000	let's take a look why we need platform socialism in the first place.
967000	973000	I mean, you sketched some of the reasons why we indeed need it already in the answer you gave before.
973000	985000	But there's a specific term, a phrase that you bring forward that tries to capture the capitalization of our social relations through digital platforms.
985000	989000	And you call it data commodity fetishism.
989000	1002000	And I think this was a very good starting point for understanding why the structures that we do have right now are absolutely not suited to bring about the futures that you just described.
1002000	1012000	So could you explain to us what you mean by data commodity fetishism and why you think that this is more of a continuation of capitalist dynamics
1012000	1017000	and not an epochal shift in the commodification of human life?
1017000	1025000	Because sometimes now critics try to frame it as if the way that platforms are operating,
1025000	1036000	the digital capitalist economy is operating as if this was a complete shift or break in the way that capital as such is functioning.
1036000	1041000	Yeah. So there's a lot there. Let's try and break it down and take it one step at a time.
1041000	1045000	I'll get to this phrase data commodity fetishism in just a sec.
1045000	1055000	So I think the key for me is thinking about before you start talking about data relations, I think you need to put it in a much longer term perspective.
1055000	1065000	And I think seeing how current forms of digital capitalism have developed out of a much longer trajectory is really important for understanding what's going on.
1065000	1073000	Because I think a lot of the time when we think about this, we're too accustomed to thinking in terms of these radical breaks and ruptures
1073000	1079000	that tends to discount the long continuities that are occurring.
1079000	1088000	Now, as capitalism develops and more people start to engage in the pursuit of profit and capitalist markets spread around the world,
1089000	1097000	what that causes is a continual revolution in the production process and in how technology is used in that process,
1097000	1108000	from textile workshops to factories and larger production plants, we're constantly, as Mike said, revolutionizing how we go about producing profit.
1108000	1119000	And so the real shift that some of these digital platforms enable, particularly in the 2010s, but kind of starting from the early 2000s,
1119000	1134000	is to enable us to live more of our lives online and to create this framework through which our social lives and our activities can be commodified through data relations.
1134000	1146000	And so I think this is really important because when you look at how the capitalist class is trying to generate profits at this time,
1146000	1161000	what the technology really opens up is a capacity to expand capitalist markets, to shift into ever more fine-grained aspects of our social lives.
1161000	1170000	So platform businesses are constantly striving for these new frontiers of profits, ways they can further integrate their services and what they do into our lives.
1170000	1179000	So all of these previously non-monetized transactions now are able to fall within this larger sphere of data extraction.
1179000	1186000	And so it's really about, for these platform companies, about creating the infrastructure that will facilitate this
1187000	1193000	so that they can kind of own the digital infrastructure of 21st century social life.
1193000	1204000	And so these platforms start to insert themselves in as middlemen, kind of financializing everyday interactions and finding ways to commodify things that we do,
1204000	1209000	from seeing a friend to chatting to family, going for a run.
1209000	1220000	All of this data and geolocation points can be fed into a system that is able to analyze all of the details and kind of package them in various ways for advertisers
1220000	1231000	as just another data point on a consumer profile that they have of you as like an 18 to 35 year old, blah, blah, blah.
1232000	1244000	And I think this process really reflects the history of capitalism as capturing a progressively greater extent of human life as a form of market commodity.
1244000	1259000	And so I think you can really see a historical parallel between the original process of kind of like of the capitalist market spreading and these new forms of enclosing digital commons.
1259000	1275000	And so this term data commodity fetishism, I think is really important because what the term means is it's trying to point to the way that we have a perception of certain digital relationships between people
1275000	1286000	as having their value based not on the social relationships themselves, but on the data they produce, that we tend to see data as a thing out there, that we understand it.
1286000	1291000	And this phrase data is the new oil is so common.
1291000	1303000	And this way of thinking about it as a kind of natural resource, I think, allows us to mystify the true source of its value and its kind of origins in human activity.
1303000	1308000	So the more time we spend online, the more our lives can be appropriated.
1309000	1316000	But data, we often think, is this kind of unclaimed good that exists out there on the Internet.
1316000	1327000	And it's just this empty space that, you know, the Zuckerbergs of the world can assert their rights over as this, you know, something that's just out there that's kind of free.
1327000	1340000	And I think when we started establishing norms over how these digital platforms operate, people didn't tend to see this as something important or something that they could have any proprietary rights over.
1340000	1356000	And I think this really enabled this kind of initial generation of millennials during the 2000s to establish all these really unfavorable norms over who owns and controls data in digital spaces.
1356000	1372000	So I think what's really at stake here is trying to reclaim some of that ownership, governance, control over this data, the true source of which really lies in our social activity.
1372000	1389000	And, you know, I think you can really see a kind of strong autonomous Marxism, so the kind of Italian Marxists of the 1970s framework here in that there's this kind of like social activity going on, you know, a lot of it online.
1389000	1399000	And it's a kind of capitalist class that comes to kind of tame that and to capture it and to find new ways of appropriating it for profit.
1399000	1408000	I mean, you already touched upon it a bit right now with the Italian autonomists, but you bring in a specific word for that as well.
1408000	1416000	And you call it user-generated profit. Could you maybe describe to us a bit this specific logic of exploitation?
1416000	1428000	What are the similarities between this new form of exploitation, which you call user-generated profit, and the forms of exploitation that are more quote unquote classical?
1428000	1434000	So in the book, I ask a question, are social media users exploited?
1434000	1439000	And I think they are, but not in the typical way that we're used to talking about exploitation.
1439000	1449000	So I think for a Marxist, workers are exploited because they're forced to work to survive, and part of the produce of their labor is taken by their employers as profit.
1449000	1457000	And that's what, you know, Marxists would call surplus value, the difference between the wage you're given and the value you're producing through your labor.
1457000	1465000	So when you think about, let's take Facebook as an example, Facebook users don't get a wage and you couldn't really describe what they're doing as work, right?
1465000	1467000	Traditionally understood, it's not labor.
1467000	1480000	So what I do is I return to this debate that was happening in the kind of late 1990s and early 2000s about cultural production in the digital economy and this idea of free labor.
1480000	1494000	So there was an Italian theorist called Tiziana Terranova, who argued that internet users are producing content and are therefore engaged in a value creating activity that we could call free labor.
1494000	1505000	So it's a way, you know, a first step towards trying to integrate these new forms of cultural production into a kind of Marxist framework for understanding what was going on.
1505000	1516000	So, you know, companies like AOL, you know, this is a long time ago now, were finding ways to basically make money off communities of users.
1516000	1521000	So internet users produce content and the companies found ways to make profit from it.
1522000	1537000	And what I argue in the book is that it doesn't really make sense to see these forms of cultural production, particularly the kind of average activities of a social media user through the lens of labor and Marxist theory of exploitation.
1537000	1539000	It's not really work.
1539000	1540000	People aren't forced to work.
1540000	1542000	They aren't controlled in the same way.
1542000	1545000	There isn't the same element of coercion.
1545000	1551000	You're not forced, you know, for your very survival to spend eight hours of your day on Facebook.
1551000	1555000	But I think we can still see this relationship as exploitative.
1555000	1559000	But we need a kind of new way of understanding how this happens.
1559000	1563000	And this is why I thought of this term user generated profit.
1563000	1574000	So in the advertising model of digital capitalism, users freely give up their data that companies then harvest to generate billions of dollars in ad revenue.
1574000	1576000	And so how is this exploitation?
1576000	1582000	Well, to exploit someone is to take unfair advantage of them and use them in some way for your benefit.
1582000	1594000	So Facebook and some of these other social media companies have organized this like digital pyramid scheme in which most of us are paid in likes and Facebook gets all the profits.
1594000	1602000	So you can see Facebook as this kind of paradigmatic model of an extractive business that is literally feeding off its community of users.
1602000	1614000	And I think the key to understanding why this is exploitative is to look at the structural power asymmetries between the platform owners and investors on the one hand and their users on the other.
1614000	1620000	And I already mentioned this term in the enclosure of the digital commons.
1620000	1644000	And I think there is an important historical analogy here between the early process of the kind of 16th, 17th century where you had landlords and colonists enclosing plots of land and privatizing it, taking it from the commons and what started to happen on the internet in the 90s and 2000s.
1644000	1664000	And we could say that Facebook and other even earlier internet companies, and I mentioned AOL, found ways to commodify a digital commons, to enclose it and to take these new communities that were forming online and basically find ways to generate profit from the communities.
1664000	1669000	And I think it's important to know that Facebook didn't invent online communities.
1669000	1672000	They didn't invent message boards or social networks.
1672000	1680000	It was a relatively simple piece of software that kind of appeared on the scene at a moment when the ideas time had come.
1680000	1682000	There were others that were doing the exact same thing.
1683000	1689000	One of his old business associates kind of sued him for stealing his idea purportedly.
1689000	1703000	But this whole business model is about value being generated by a social collective, which is appropriated by a largely unproductive group of owners and investors who are benefiting from the user's activity.
1703000	1710000	And hence the term user generated profit to describe how this kind of exploitation works.
1710000	1731000	And I think before we get to the constructive part of how alternatives could look like, it's still important to stay a little bit more in the realm of critique, because I really like the way in which you point out the essential flaws in Shoshana Zuboff's line of argument in the age of surveillance capitalism.
1731000	1741000	And since it is an incredibly influential take on the topic of data and I mean, of course, surveillance capitalism is in itself now a standing term.
1741000	1749000	Could you explain why surveillance capitalism fails to actually address the core problems that you just described?
1749000	1762000	Yeah, so Zuboff's The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, I think, did a really amazing job when it came out of selling itself to broad sections of the left as a critique of digital capitalism.
1762000	1768000	And you'll hear many people talking about surveillance capitalism, you know, and really taking up that framework.
1768000	1780000	But I think what really flew under the radar was the fact that this wasn't really a critique of capitalism at all, but really a plea ultimately for a kind of softer, more gentle kind of capitalism.
1780000	1783000	It's a critique of surveillance technology.
1783000	1799000	But I think what it fails to see is how the very logic of companies like Facebook and Google is, as we've been saying, in fact, a continuation of a logic of extraction and commodification, which is inherent in capitalism itself.
1799000	1809000	So surveillance capitalism is just capitalism with some new toys, not some kind of weird aberration of a kind of capitalism gone wrong or gone rogue.
1809000	1824000	But, you know, credit where credit's due, I think what the book does really well is give you quite an accurate sociological description of what we could call the advertising platform model, where platforms attract users through offering these tools and software that people
1824000	1832000	like, and then collecting data based on people's use of the platform to create these targeted advertising products to sell to businesses.
1832000	1841000	And I think it does this very well. I think it really does a great job of showing how this developed at Google and then how it spread to Facebook and other other companies.
1841000	1848000	What it doesn't do as well is really situating this within broader trends of capitalist development.
1848000	1859000	So rather than, you know, seeing this as a continuation of the expansion of capitalist markets and the pursuit of profit and this kind of new way in which companies could could extract value from users.
1859000	1867000	You know, Google's activities are kind of put down to this surveillance imperative, which is like a self-reinforcing drive.
1867000	1873000	People have to surveil for surveillance's sake to collect data for, yeah, for its own end, basically.
1873000	1884000	And I think this this kind of way of operating is then depicted as some kind of rogue mutation of capitalism that, you know, ultimately could potentially be redirected.
1884000	1902000	I mean, Zuboff isn't that big on solutions or proposals, but ultimately she, you know, there is this this specter of what she calls an advocacy oriented capitalism that is kind of lurking in the background in which businesses are trying to satisfy consumer demand.
1902000	1905000	They're trying to develop better products.
1905000	1916000	And there's this kind of virtuous cycle between businesses satisfying the consumer and consumers, you know, getting what they want out of the transaction.
1916000	1925000	And I think something else that doesn't get really picked up on that much with Zuboff's framework is that it's only really describing one very particular type of platform.
1925000	1931000	So this advertising model doesn't really have much to say about all of these other aspects of the digital economy.
1931000	1937000	So, you know, is is a company like Uber within the surveillance capitalism paradigm?
1937000	1943000	I mean, they're collecting data off, you know, their workers and customers.
1943000	1948000	They're not selling advertising products or at least it's not the main source of their revenue.
1948000	1952000	So to what extent does that kind of fit within the picture?
1952000	1963000	And I think the real danger here is that when we use the surveillance capitalism framework to talk about these issues, I think we obscure the fact that this is capitalism kind of operating as it should.
1963000	1979000	And as it always has expanding the logic of the market, expanding the capitalization of human life rather than than some kind of freak exception that we could kind of roll back the clock on.
1979000	1991000	So I think what technology of social media platforms and transaction platforms allows is for these forms of commodification to sink even deeper into everyday life.
1991000	2002000	And I think we really have to understand that this is kind of has been the plan all along, that this is just capitalism doing what it should do.
2003000	2022000	And I think it's simply really important that if you encounter like proposals within the mainstream left, that you look towards how far they actually allow themselves to go in within the analysis and whether or not they allow themselves to ask if this is actually the case.
2022000	2037000	What you just described that capitalism is in this sense working as it should and that this analysis will lead you to basically the question how to address the problems that we see on a more fundamental level.
2037000	2048000	And there are some proposals on the mainstream left that are quite popular that still do not really take on this question in a serious way.
2048000	2059000	And some of the examples for this are the so-called new deal on data or, for example, boycott of big tech or breaking up big tech.
2059000	2062000	But still, this is not enough, you say.
2062000	2069000	Why do these proposals also fall short of making a really fundamental difference in the end?
2069000	2077000	Yeah, I think one of the main points I'm trying to get across to the book is that most of our current responses within mainstream discourse are insufficient.
2078000	2083000	Or don't deal with what I think are the main problems of ownership and control.
2083000	2086000	So let me take two dominant approaches as examples.
2086000	2091000	I'll talk about like a tech humanist response and this anti-monopoly agenda, which is so big.
2091000	2097000	So I think the first is more prominent in like everyday discourse when people are talking about technology in their everyday lives.
2097000	2106000	And the second one is kind of more prominent at like a governmental level, thinking about how states and regulatory bodies should react to big tech.
2106000	2116000	So the first, the humanist critique tells us that we're being psychologically manipulated by big tech, that we're like rats in the cage,
2116000	2122000	we're automatons that have been programmed by these soft nudges that social media platforms can give us.
2122000	2132000	So think of like the example of the tech insider turned critic Tristan Harris, this guy who was one of the stars of the Netflix show The Social Dilemma,
2132000	2141000	who was a previous employee in one of the big tech companies and talks about how our brains are being hijacked.
2141000	2150000	And I think this is really one important angle and one important way in which people are used to talking about the problems of big tech and technology.
2150000	2161000	Because the underlying point here is that our human autonomy is under threat, that somehow these companies are finding ways to circumvent our ability to make rational choices.
2161000	2166000	I think this really came across in the Netflix show, which also featured Zuboff, right?
2166000	2171000	I think there is a kind of very humanist critique to her framework as well.
2171000	2181000	And I think the problem with this kind of way of looking at things is that ultimately it tends to be reduced to more ethical and humane uses of technology
2181000	2189000	that doesn't really identify the structural factors for why companies develop these technologies in the first place.
2189000	2198000	And I think a lot of the solutions that end up getting offered are framed in terms of you should turn off your social media platform.
2198000	2204000	You should use it less. You should exercise your consumer choice. We should try and get companies to do better.
2204000	2218000	We need more ethical CEOs. And often those calling for these changes are doing so from within the exact same mindset and worldview of the companies that caused the problems in the first place.
2218000	2231000	It's often people deep within the tech industry who probably played a role in inventing a lot of these things, looking for a late career change, who want to kind of start their own NGO or think tank.
2231000	2238000	And so I think the humanist critique also avoids talking about really important economic questions.
2238000	2243000	Who owns the platforms? Who gets to control them? How are users exploited?
2243000	2258000	And so I think there's this real individualizing aspect to this kind of humanist critique that ultimately tends to move towards this individual choice paradigm.
2258000	2267000	And so, yeah, I think that that is quite limited in how we need to talk about the problem of technology and tech companies.
2267000	2274000	The second critique I have a lot more time for, the anti-monopoly critique.
2274000	2287000	And people who are kind of working within this paradigm think that we need tighter regulations for big tech, particularly the kind of anti-competitive practices that big tech companies engage in.
2287000	2296000	So when they act as gatekeepers, when they form these big conglomerates and try and control digital markets in various ways.
2296000	2304000	And I think the anti-monopoly critic thinks that the tech companies are squeezing out the little guys.
2304000	2309000	And the aim here is to kind of restore competition to the tech sector.
2309000	2320000	And if, you know, for example, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority recently blocked Metta's acquisition of Giphy.
2320000	2327000	And we can also see in Europe, the EU just voted to pass the Digital Markets Act, which, you know, is coming into force.
2327000	2333000	And there's also just worldwide, there's, I think, like over 70 anti-trust cases against big tech.
2333000	2336000	So it's a really big agenda.
2336000	2342000	And I think, you know, this has a lot of merit to it, like tech companies clearly do need more regulation.
2342000	2345000	They do need more oversight.
2345000	2348000	Some of them are too big and too powerful, right?
2348000	2360000	But I think one of the problems with really focusing on this idea of like breaking up big tech is that if you did break up the conglomerates, it wouldn't necessarily be a good thing for users or for us.
2360000	2365000	You know, what would happen if there were like 10 different Facebooks?
2365000	2368000	They'd probably not be interoperable.
2368000	2373000	It's not really the same as like utilities companies who have to kind of compete for your service.
2373000	2377000	The whole point of a social network, right, is that it's international in its scope.
2377000	2385000	You don't want like a Midwestern Facebook versus like, you know, Australian Facebook and for them to have difficulty communicating.
2385000	2400000	But I think the other and more important issue is that even if you do separate these big tech companies into separate smaller companies, they're still going to be structurally incentivized to operate in a very similar manner.
2400000	2405000	Because the problem isn't that their CEO is unethical, although they may be.
2405000	2419000	The problem is that it's a for-profit business that within the digital economy is incentivized to use the digital infrastructure to maximize user engagement and to prioritize the profits of the company above other considerations.
2419000	2429000	And I think these kind of structural incentives and how the markets operate really needs to be put front and center.
2429000	2435000	And so there is, but as I said, there is a kind of positive aspect of this anti-monopoly agenda.
2435000	2443000	I think we should support the kinds of regulations and lawsuits that are being brought against big tech.
2443000	2456000	But I think you do need to kind of clearly separate the point at which there can be a certain strategic alliance with, you know, largely with liberals on these issues and where that alliance begins to break down.
2456000	2462000	Because the end goal for us on the left isn't it's not about restoring competition in markets.
2462000	2473000	It's about reversing the commodification and privatization of the Internet and creating more spaces of social ownership, more spaces for democracy and for economic democracy.
2473000	2486000	And so when you turn to these ideas of like a new deal on data, you know, people are talking about the need to create more individual property rights around people's personal data.
2486000	2502000	And I think the problem with this approach is that there's a real risk here of entrenching, you know, a model which is only beginning to take shape while simultaneously making it more difficult to introduce any kind of other social alternatives.
2502000	2521000	So when you think about proposals for like, for example, for data dividends, you know, an individual who uses some kind of tech software should be reimbursed, you know, a few cents or a few pennies for every photo they upload or every piece of data that the company can profit from.
2521000	2529000	I think these proposals for data dividends, well, firstly, they don't do anything to contest the corporation's right to harvest the data in the first place.
2529000	2535000	It's like, well, you know, the data harvesting is going to take place. You do want to be paid a few cents or don't you?
2536000	2555000	And I think what the risk here is that it creates this new revenue stream for individuals and that it pushes us further into this world in which every thought we have, every emotion we express online is kind of partially oriented towards who might buy it on a data market.
2555000	2564000	And I think that is a kind of world that we're seeing more and more with like influences and, you know, creators on platforms.
2564000	2575000	And I'm not sure it's one that is particularly appealing or one that we want to, you know, to work towards that it's, again, it's an individual, individualized approach to the problems.
2575000	2579000	It's not pushing towards forms of collective or social control over what's happening.
2579000	2584000	It's not pushing or creating any new forms of solidarity between people.
2584000	2603000	And you're just going to see the same inequalities emerge and it's going to reinforce existing inequalities, you know, between users in the global south and users in the global north whose data and whose value to the companies is going to be very different.
2603000	2619000	Right. So I think the user, so the revenue that users generate for companies like Facebook in North America is like 10 times the kind of value and revenue they generate for the company in places like, you know, South Asia.
2619000	2623000	So it's huge inequalities that might open up there as well.
2624000	2629000	Yeah, so we definitely do need structural alternatives.
2629000	2633000	So let's move on from the critique to the more interesting stuff.
2633000	2646000	So the question of how platform socialism could actually be organized is, of course, a huge one when it comes to the fundamental principles of platform socialism.
2647000	2648000	And I quote you here.
2661000	2672000	This is really interesting to me because all too often people nowadays tend to present some version of the strong state as if it was a desirable alternative.
2672000	2683000	I do not think so, but you use the work of GDH Cole and Otto Neurath as inspiration to think about a guilt socialism of the digital economy.
2683000	2691000	What is the basic organizational structure and what are the core principles you derive from these authors?
2691000	2698000	Maybe let's start with Cole's libertarian socialist perspective and then move on to Neurath.
2698000	2702000	What does GDH Cole's thinking bring to the table?
2702000	2707000	So, yeah, I do have a chapter called Guild Socialism for the Digital Economy.
2707000	2717000	It's meant to be kind of like a joke because guilt socialism is like this, like very seemingly antiquated, like forgotten idea on the left.
2717000	2725000	And to think that it would kind of have a way of talking to people interested in the digital economy, you know, some people might doubt that.
2725000	2735000	But one of the main contributions of the book is to revive the ideas of GDH Cole and the guild socialists as a way for us to rethink certain aspects of digital platforms.
2735000	2747000	And there's a chapter based on Cole and Neurath's work, which tries to set out how we could democratize platforms and foster new forms of decentralized government.
2747000	2757000	So Cole was a guild socialist who joined the Fabian Society, which is a British socialist organization that was founded in the 1880s.
2757000	2762000	And it kind of helped found the British Labour Party.
2762000	2771000	But Cole became a critic of the Fabian's tendency to think more in terms of like top down and state led forms of nationalization.
2771000	2783000	And I think, you know, Cole's critique of the Fabian Society and of kind of like the British Labour movement at the time is that he thought that there wasn't enough room for workplace democracy,
2783000	2789000	for forms of local decision making and self-government at the level of the workplace.
2789000	2794000	So he kind of becomes this critic of status forms of socialism.
2794000	2804000	And, you know, the guild socialists and the Fabians engage in these really, you know, fierce debates in the kind of 1910s and 20s.
2804000	2809000	Because Cole thought that, you know, you can't just have top down forms of nationalization.
2809000	2815000	You don't want to just replace capitalist owners with distant bureaucrats, right?
2815000	2822000	So guild socialism emerges during the First World War and kind of has a brief moment in the 1920s.
2822000	2830000	And essentially what it is, is like a more decentralized and federalist alternative within British socialism.
2830000	2837000	So the kind of main current of British socialism has usually been quite a centralized form of socialism.
2837000	2846000	And Cole develops this critique of the Fabians that we could call it an associational socialism, for lack of a better word.
2846000	2852000	I know that's a bit of a mouthful. I think in the book, I actually call it an associational democracy.
2852000	2855000	But basically, it's this kind of critique of the Fabians.
2855000	2867000	And really what it's about is that for Cole, all major institutions and associations from like firms and workplaces to universities and cultural institutions,
2867000	2871000	all of these should have an internal democratic structure.
2871000	2881000	So they should also all have processes through which individuals can have the ability to both elect representatives and have a direct say in how they're operated.
2881000	2894000	So it's about trying to expand the principles of democracy from like what he saw as a very narrow political sphere to a much broader application of these principles to other institutions in social life.
2894000	2902000	So he wanted a much more participatory society, you know, in which the role of the state is vastly diminished.
2902000	2915000	It's very reduced and a kind of series of producer and consumer and municipal associations are jointly responsible for coordinating different aspects of social life.
2915000	2924000	So the state kind of gets demoted. It's made as kind of one insert, one coordinating agency in a larger ensemble.
2924000	2931000	And this larger ensemble is kind of in, you know, is constituted by internally democratic associations.
2931000	2940000	So the state or the coordinating body, he begins to call the national commune, you know, using the language of the Paris Commune.
2940000	2946000	And he really starts to think about how do you create a more participatory democratic society?
2946000	2950000	How do you distribute these new forms of governance to these different institutions?
2950000	2956000	And the real aim of all of this is about giving individuals more control over how their lives operate.
2956000	2967000	It's about finding new forms of arrangements to take that control back and try and decentralize and devolve power in various ways.
2967000	2971000	So I think we can, you know, to start with, how does this relate to digital platforms?
2971000	2980000	Well, I think we can think of platforms as bringing together these kinds of communities and associations that make up social life.
2980000	2987000	And of course, there's a diverse range of communities, so they have to be owned and governed in different ways.
2987000	2997000	But I think the underlying principle here that we can take from coal and apply to the digital economy is thinking about how do we make these communities more democratic?
2997000	3004000	And I think what guild theory really points us towards is a focus on the functions performed by each platform.
3004000	3012000	So we have to tailor the democratic structures to reflect the functions the platform performs.
3012000	3015000	I think that's the starting point.
3015000	3017000	Could you maybe give an example?
3017000	3025000	Because, I mean, there's a whole range of ways that one could think about what democratic actually means.
3025000	3036000	So maybe could you give us an example where the way in which the specific association is organized is derived from its specific function?
3036000	3043000	Because I think this is a very interesting way to phrase it and kind of intuitively makes sense somehow.
3043000	3055000	But still, it's not within my imaginative reach immediately to have an understanding of how this could look like in very concrete terms.
3055000	3060000	Yeah, well, I think you need to look at a few different questions, right?
3060000	3064000	And there's going to be a few different things that come in here.
3064000	3072000	But one of them is like the level that the platform would need to operate based on the kind of community that it has, right?
3072000	3076000	Is it a community that is locally and geographically bound?
3076000	3084000	Is it, for example, like a bike courier service that necessarily is only going to serve people within biking distance?
3084000	3094000	Or is it an international social network, which necessarily is going to require a community that expands beyond the bounds of the nation state?
3094000	3098000	So I think there is one question here of like the level that it operates on.
3098000	3106000	There's a second question of the kind of services or the kind of business that the platform offers.
3106000	3116000	So is it a platform marketplace where service providers are trying to locate clients and vice versa?
3116000	3121000	Or is it, for example, like an Internet search engine?
3122000	3126000	So different platforms perform different functions.
3126000	3138000	And I think we need to tailor the kinds of democratic structures to reflect both the level at which it could operate and the different functions that it performs.
3138000	3142000	And what I try to do in the book is give concrete examples.
3142000	3146000	So, for example, there's like, you know, a ride hail app.
3146000	3149000	There's a kind of short term accommodation service.
3149000	3157000	There's like a socialist search engine and really try and, you know, give some details to how this this might operate.
3157000	3167000	And, you know, drawing from Cole, again, I want to move to kind of questions, you know, trying to set up a framework for thinking about these questions of ownership and control.
3167000	3174000	What I really take from Cole is this pluralist approach to democratic platform governance.
3174000	3182000	So when we're thinking about how would platforms be owned and operated, I don't think there's any single model.
3182000	3192000	Right. So I think when when guild socialism tells us to look to the function that the community performs, I think this necessarily leads us to thinking about like,
3192000	3208000	how do we cultivate an ecosystem of alternative social ownership models, you know, that stretch from the kind of local level of the small scale worker cooperatives to a kind of larger community, to municipal owned services,
3208000	3220000	right up to the kind of national and international levels, because I think that allows us to then look at these different kinds of models for how platforms could be operated
3220000	3223000	and not try to have a one size fits all.
3223000	3240000	And so when you're thinking about this pluralist approach to democratic platform governance, I think there's some really good lessons from the, for example, the socialization debates that occurred in Germany around the time of the German Revolution and a bit before and after.
3240000	3253000	And I think reading these debates helps us to first of all, to identify two equally undesirable options for how to democratize platforms and then to help us think about what the specific models could look like.
3253000	3258000	So firstly, let's talk about what the, you know, the undesirable options are.
3258000	3266000	I think the first undesirable option is, you know, what Cole identifies as these top down managerial forms of nationalization.
3266000	3271000	You know, and during when the pandemic first started, people were like, oh, we need to nationalize Amazon.
3271000	3281000	We need to nationalize, you know, these digital infrastructure and these kinds of big picture nationalization projects are really what dominated the 20th century.
3281000	3286000	And I think when people think of socialism, they naturally think of big state owned industries.
3286000	3290000	And I think there's a good reason why their mind turns to that.
3290000	3297000	But for Cole, the problem with some of these efforts is that they didn't guarantee greater worker participation.
3297000	3301000	They don't give you necessarily forms of workplace democracy.
3301000	3307000	And they don't always entail kind of new forms of local decision making.
3307000	3315000	So workers having control over how their workplaces are organized, having a lot of these functions devolve to a more local level.
3315000	3331000	And so I think that's a big weakness when we conceive of socialism exclusively in terms of nationalization, which I think, you know, maybe there will be nationalized industries or organizations, but I don't think that's the end point of the discussion.
3331000	3342000	And the second option that I think is also, you know, going too far in the other direction is when we think about socialism as just turning workplaces directly over to their workers.
3342000	3346000	And this is an idea that is associated with some forms of syndicalism.
3346000	3349000	And I think there are two main problems here.
3349000	3355000	And the first is with inequalities that would emerge between different industries and workplaces, right?
3355000	3367000	Because some workers, like if you're at Google and, you know, however many employees are at Google adopt the kind of direct control over the whole organization,
3367000	3374000	they're going to have a lot more power than, for example, someone working at like a bike courier service in their local neighborhood.
3374000	3390000	And what the fear was in these socialization debates is that, you know, this would encourage workers or give some workers the possibility of kind of like exploiting others and using their greater power to kind of achieve their own ends.
3390000	3407000	But I think there's a second issue that wasn't as prominent in the debates, but I think is probably even more important, which is the inequalities that would emerge between those engaged in full-time paid work and others who did maybe unpaid voluntary or care work, right?
3407000	3417000	Because I think the more you locate political power at the level of the workplace, the more these kinds of exclusions tend to crop up.
3417000	3424000	And then this kind of workerist vision of the early 20th century wasn't very good at accounting for these kinds of problems.
3424000	3427000	They're not particularly good on questions of gender.
3427000	3438000	They're not particularly good on, for example, unemployed people at the time and how they would be facilitated within these kinds of councils.
3438000	3440000	So I think there's a big problem there.
3440000	3461000	And some of the better theoretical responses to this socialization dilemma involve combining, you know, forms of local democracy and decision making with broader coordinating institutions that also operated at like a higher level, at like a regional level and a national level.
3461000	3470000	And these kinds of more pyramidal structures is what started to get developed by some of the Austrian Marxists.
3470000	3476000	So people like Otto Bauer and get adopted by, you know, many of the Germans.
3476000	3482000	So like Karl Kautsky, who's one of the leading theorists of German social democracy in the early 20th century.
3482000	3493000	I think this is where you get to these proposals that start to look like a kind of federal structure with functions performed at different levels of the hierarchy.
3493000	3502000	And I think if we think about what the digital economy could look like, you know, let's start at the local level.
3502000	3511000	It would probably start with smaller and medium firms being owned by their workers, having these, you know, what's sometimes called platform cooperatives.
3511000	3520000	So if you think of examples like on demand courier services or domestic workers and care workers, perhaps some of these could be run by workers.
3520000	3534000	Right. So that that could be an adequate starting point for certain types of digital businesses, you know, ones that don't require many overheads that might not require a huge amount of investment in digital infrastructure.
3534000	3539000	I think the starting point for digital platforms could be these work around businesses, but that couldn't be the end of the discussion.
3539000	3549000	Right. So I think firstly, you could have structures set up for municipal associations to support these services and these businesses.
3549000	3554000	So that might want to give them things like access to spaces, to office space.
3554000	3562000	They might have access to like loans or training programs or some kind of support services that might help them.
3562000	3571000	But then you'd also see the need for larger platforms and larger organizations to be run by different types of organizations.
3571000	3579000	And this is where I think you start to think about the function that the platform performs and the level of capital and investment that would be required to do it.
3579000	3587000	So when you think of something like a ride hail app, it's very difficult for a small workers' co-op to run something like this.
3587000	3603000	Right. If you think of like a huge citywide short term rental service, these start to be the kind of things, these projects that are kind of probably because of their function, better run by a municipality or city association.
3604000	3612000	Organizations that have a budget to provide the infrastructure that have a kind of more stable governance structure.
3612000	3625000	And it's about thinking about what forms of social ownership within this ecosystem that we've been discussing are best suited to the particular service that the platform's providing.
3625000	3640000	I think one more important point about digital platforms, you know, you're talking about concrete examples, is that unlike more traditional forms of community that are kind of typically geographically bound, it's like a local neighborhood or something,
3640000	3648000	digital platforms have this unique attribute of bringing together very diverse communities, right, sometimes from across the world.
3648000	3658000	And also communities that sometimes have very opposing interests, you know, they bring together like consumers and producers, clients and service providers.
3658000	3665000	And, you know, sometimes there are these opposing interests in how the platform should be operated, right.
3665000	3679000	And I think platforms like this could benefit from what's called like a multi-stakeholder governance, where different parts of the community have a percentage share in the governance of the organization.
3679000	3700000	So to give you one concrete example, an organization like Resonate, which is a platform that does stream to own music, now what they do is they divide their governance between artists, listeners and workers who kind of have a 45-35-20 split in the governance of the organization.
3700000	3711000	And this type of multi-stakeholder governance is kind of quite suited to digital platforms because of the kinds of communities they bring together.
3711000	3718000	And it could potentially enable diverse communities to have a say in how a platform is operated.
3718000	3723000	You did a pretty good job in describing the subsidiarity principle in place.
3723000	3732000	And this really helps to imagine how there could be a what you call ecosystem of different levels and approaches.
3732000	3744000	Otto Neurath proposed a specific type of participatory planning that you use to inspire your thinking about how this could be approached.
3744000	3755000	Could you maybe explain to us some of the elements you find useful in his work and how a planning process in associational socialism might actually look like?
3755000	3760000	Yeah, so Otto Neurath was an Austrian philosopher and economist.
3760000	3763000	And he's also ran during a kind of similar time to Kohl, right?
3763000	3766000	So in the early 20th century, right up to the Second World War.
3766000	3770000	And he's one of the participants in the socialist calculation debate.
3771000	3780000	It was actually his ideas around socialization that prompted Ludwig von Mises to write his critical reply, which really kicked things off.
3780000	3790000	Neurath is a person that I think can really teach us a lot about questions of planning and the importance of democracy to that.
3790000	3795000	So Neurath is an admirer of Kohl and the Guild of Socialists.
3795000	3800000	He is inspired by their ideas around associational socialism.
3800000	3810000	And what Neurath really wanted to add to the picture was this emphasis on the importance of democratic planning for how a socialist economy could be organized.
3810000	3822000	And we can turn to Neurath to think about how we might tackle some of these big picture system level challenges that we face, things like climate change, you know, response to global pandemics, this kind of thing.
3823000	3836000	And so Neurath thought that the private ownership of capital or what we could call production goods, so goods that are going kind of into the production process to produce new consumer products,
3836000	3842000	how these capital goods should be changed to a form of social ownership.
3842000	3856000	And so what he's really after is to create a kind of democratic process for how we allocate resources, you know, at a societal level and invest in long term infrastructure and projects.
3856000	3864000	So he didn't think that this should be something that should be left to kind of private operators, to billionaires and, you know, entrepreneurs.
3864000	3871000	His point was that it's not just about establishing internally democratic organizations.
3871000	3879000	We also need to start turning our attention to much larger questions of long term industrial and economic strategy.
3879000	3889000	So his real project was to think about how these ideas and how these issues could be subjected to processes of deliberation.
3889000	3899000	So we as a society need to discuss what is the best, you know, broad brush stroke allocation of very scarce resources.
3899000	3909000	He didn't think this should just be left up to the chaos of the market or to the self-interested maneuvers of billionaires.
3909000	3918000	And I think that it's a really overlooked part of, you know, important debate that's happened within the 20th century.
3918000	3931000	And his contribution here is to point out that economic planning and the kind of function of markets is not simply about optimizing for efficiency in production.
3932000	3939000	So when you read some of the neoclassical economists within this debate and, you know, ideas that are still kind of quite popular today,
3939000	3945000	you get the idea that, you know, these kinds of economic questions are really not political questions at all.
3945000	3950000	It's just about how we could achieve some kind of Pareto efficiency.
3950000	3955000	So how can we achieve a kind of optimally allocated set of resources?
3956000	3963000	And I think what Neurat really makes clear is that this kind of framework, when we talk about the economy in these terms,
3963000	3973000	really disregards the fact that when we're allocating resources, we're making qualitative decisions about the kind of society we want to live in.
3973000	3975000	You know, it's not just about efficiency.
3975000	3984000	It's about genuine political decisions about living in this or that type of society, about what kinds of investments we want to make.
3984000	3987000	Do we want to, you know, care for the elderly?
3987000	3991000	Do we want to make sure that we have a planet we can live on in 50 years time?
3991000	3995000	And these are irreducible to simple questions of efficiency.
3995000	4005000	I think this is one of Neurat's main points, because he imagines an economic plan and the process of planning as creating a kind of blueprint
4005000	4012000	or vision for a particular way of life and a particular kind of society we want in the future.
4012000	4018000	So that's one really important aspect of his ideas that we can kind of return to today.
4018000	4030000	And what he offers is this idea that, well, we need to establish new kinds of institutions that would allow us as a society to have deliberations on
4030000	4040000	in order so that we could make conscious decisions about investment and about which kinds of economy, which kinds of sectors in the economy we want to grow.
4040000	4043000	And where do we want to invest our money?
4043000	4055000	And I think the only way to kind of do this is to start talking about quite radical things, to start talking about how large capital funds could be expropriated,
4055000	4061000	to start talking about the fact that maybe we can't have billionaires in this kind of society.
4061000	4073000	Maybe the large pools of capital and the large resources that we have need to be within democratic control, that we as a society should have processes to decide on this.
4073000	4081000	And it shouldn't just be down to a handful of people to dictate to everyone else what kind of future we want to live in.
4081000	4093000	And so this idea of platform socialism is really about thinking about how we can start to develop these kinds of processes and these kinds of institutions
4093000	4100000	that will partly take into account the new kind of technical means that we have available to us, right?
4100000	4102000	But I think there is an important point here, right?
4102000	4109000	Because once again, just like Cole, Neurat also sees himself as a pluralist socialist.
4109000	4120000	And so I think it's important to point out that he didn't see the kind of project of socialism as kind of molding everything to a single plan.
4120000	4128000	When he talks about a plan or processes of planning and how plans could be created, this really is a kind of democratic and deliberative process.
4128000	4140000	And I think you can distinguish some of Neurat's ideas, which might be more similar to what we could call like indicative planning from the kinds of centralized planning that were undertaken in the Soviet Union.
4140000	4150000	And so I think Neurat is really clear that there needs to be a degree of tolerance and flexibility in how different parts of the economy are going to achieve these targets.
4150000	4156000	It's really about trying to think about what kind of big picture targets we're going to make.
4156000	4167000	What kinds of directions do we want to be moving in rather than everyone basically getting a sheet of paper of how they need to act in the next five years from some kind of central authority?
4167000	4177000	So I think there are ways of kind of even opening Neurat's ideas themselves up to new forms of participatory processes, right?
4177000	4195000	To new forms of decentralized forms of planning that we might be able to come up with, because I think even Neurat himself is kind of like, you know, a little bit taken up within this like early 20th century kind of quite centralized project of a kind of modernist mindset.
4195000	4207000	And so I, in the book, talk about, you know, new forms of participatory planning that might look a bit more decentralized and a bit more similar to some of the things that Cole had in mind.
4208000	4224000	But let's dig a little deeper there, because I think there's still, I mean, it's pretty easy to imagine these large scale infrastructure projects to be democratized.
4224000	4243000	In some way, because this is a very, these are very concrete types of proposals that are put out there and deliberative process could be achieved in which you try to come to decisions in a way that is like broadly emancipatory.
4243000	4263000	But I mean, there still is a lack of describing a mechanism that kind of tries to address the more meso level organization, the coordination between the different associations, the questions of how certain goods are actually allocated, how resources are allocated within these economies.
4263000	4281000	Because, I mean, when you talk about Hayek in the book at the end of discussing the socialist calculation debate, you state that digital platforms make it easier than ever before to examine new ways of distributing resources through democratic methods, end quote.
4281000	4288000	And I think this is obviously true, and we have to build up on this, but also it's kind of vague.
4288000	4301000	So, I mean, there needs to be some kind of digital infrastructure in place, but this is only achievable by imagining an inherent principle.
4301000	4330000	And it doesn't have to be one principle, but it has to be an idea of how this task of organizing the different semi-autonomous associations within societies, how to organize those between each other, between meso, micro and macro level and the different questions that go along with these huge tasks and questions.
4330000	4344000	So I kind of understand the hint towards Neurath in terms of, okay, we need to have democratic structures all the way up and down and left and right, so to speak.
4344000	4370000	So this is something that I absolutely share, but it still leaves open a lot of questions in terms of how economic planning could be approached in concrete terms beyond these large scale infrastructure projects, for example, and beyond the idea of having cooperatives on a smaller or middle or large scale.
4370000	4390000	Because cooperatives, as you rightly point out at some point in the book, are still forced to compete with each other if they are organized within a political economy that still has markets, for example, or capital for that matter.
4390000	4403000	Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. It's like one of the big problems is how do you connect the kind of lower local level with this big picture stuff? And it is a really important question. It's a really big problem.
4403000	4421000	I think the answer lies for this kind of system in kind of forms of negotiated coordination that would take place between federal bodies. And I think it's kind of like it's necessarily going to be a bit of a messy process.
4421000	4430000	But I think we can talk a little bit about what that might look like. You seem to be after some kind of concrete description of what those mechanisms might be.
4430000	4444000	I think Hayek is an important interlocutor here because he really shines the spotlight on the purported benefits of markets in being able to communicate information very quickly through the price mechanism.
4444000	4457000	For him, the great thing about markets is that you can instantly know something that's happened in, I don't know, in Bangladesh because of a change in the price of some kind of production good.
4457000	4467000	You will then adjust your kind of activities accordingly. And I think one of his main criticisms of planning, and for him planning is centralized planning, right? That's just part of his definition.
4467000	4471000	He thinks planning has to be centralized planning by a central body.
4471000	4492000	One of his criticisms is that a single planning authority is never going to be able to have the kind of knowledge needed to constantly make all of these on the spot, on the ground decisions because it's not able to work in the ways of the wonders of the market in his eyes.
4492000	4508000	So what do we do with this problem of how to communicate information? How do we ensure that the kinds of planning decisions that we're making and the deliberations we're having are properly informed by the kind of up-to-date knowledge on the ground?
4508000	4526000	And I think when I mentioned that platforms enable new possibilities in this regard, I think digital platforms and the kind of big data revolution have quite altered the position and allow us to come at some of these problems from a slightly different angle, right?
4526000	4540000	Because one of the biggest problems for the kind of, you know, neoclassical people engaged in the first debate on the socialist calculation debate is how do you balance consumer demand with supply, right?
4540000	4550000	It's like they see it as a big equation. Now, I don't think that's the best or the only way to see it, but there is a kind of ways in which we could approach this problem, right?
4550000	4555000	So Cole and Neurath's idea is that there would be these economic cycles.
4555000	4570000	And so this is particularly, you know, drawing from Cole's idea of these associations that are kind of like, you know, producer associations, consumer associations, and that the consumer councils or associations can draw up consumption plans.
4570000	4580000	You know, they can kind of take stock of what kind of demand there might be, and they can draw up budgets or draw up kind of balance sheets for what they think consumers will need.
4580000	4585000	Now, you can imagine this taking place at like a kind of local and a regional level, right?
4585000	4596000	And I did say that there's a kind of element of messiness to this, but I think that's kind of the only way you could think about doing this in a kind of democratic way.
4596000	4611000	And that these kinds of budgets would have to be balanced or they'd have to be matched by an account from producer organizations for what kind, you know, based on the technology that was available and the supply of raw materials, what kind of products could be produced.
4611000	4624000	Now, you know, in the early 20th century, it's very difficult to imagine how an entire national economy could do this in any feasible fashion.
4624000	4635000	But if you imagine a website like Amazon, for example, or just, you know, a more general catalogue of goods and the capacity that we now have, the computational capacity,
4635000	4648000	both to automatically update these kinds of spreadsheets and to kind of predict consumption needs to forecast what kind of factors will be at play, you know, in six or 12 months time.
4648000	4657000	Suddenly, a lot of the restrictions on gathering knowledge about consumer preferences don't end up seeming so insurmountable.
4658000	4667000	So there's this increased calculative capacity, which I think leads, you know, a lot of people to start returning to some of these questions of planning, right?
4667000	4674000	So you've got that book, The People's Republic of Walmart, by Lee Phillips and Michael Orasvorsky.
4674000	4679000	And, you know, people are saying, say, well, can we have these new processes of planning in the age of big data?
4679000	4683000	And Evgeny Morozov also has a nice essay on this.
4683000	4692000	And I think, you know, some of the some of the computational questions are now a kind of it's a different set of problems for us.
4692000	4698000	But I think what the real challenge is that remains is how do you do this in a democratic way?
4698000	4705000	Right. Because as Noirat kind of shows, it's not just about optimizing the allocation of resources.
4705000	4710000	We also need to think about the big picture questions of the kinds of societies we want to live in.
4710000	4715000	We want people to have a genuine say over those questions.
4715000	4724000	And so when you think of the kind of local regional councils, you know, the possibility that these could be guided by a kind of indicative plan,
4724000	4734000	while still allowing some kind of autonomy to make decisions for the people within those organizations,
4734000	4743000	I return again and again to this idea of a kind of federal model, one that doesn't try to centralize power too much at the top,
4743000	4750000	but does allow for some kind of unifying around these, you know, some of these questions.
4750000	4757000	And I think that it's, you know, perhaps too early to tell what the precise institutional structure would look like.
4757000	4765000	But I think we need to start thinking more about it and talking more about what kinds of processes might be involved.
4765000	4782000	And I think I wasn't paying enough attention when you were describing who will be drawing up these plans that will inform like the consumption plans that you talked about.
4782000	4787000	Those were like regional committees.
4787000	4794000	Yes, I think when you're thinking about the two sides of the equation, right, like the consumption and production, at least in Cole's theory,
4794000	4799000	he envisioned that there would be consumer councils and producer councils.
4799000	4801000	Obviously, there'd be some overlap there, right?
4801000	4807000	Because, you know, a worker within a particular organization is also going to have consumption needs,
4807000	4820000	but that there would be these two different types of councils and that these would also be involved in these forms of negotiated coordination with what Cole called the national commune,
4820000	4825000	but a kind of like higher institution that was involved in helping them.
4825000	4830000	I mean, in his words, it's helping them balance the budgets, right, in these economic cycles.
4830000	4835000	And we can think of that in how that might operate in the age of big data.
4835000	4839000	But that's the general gist of the idea.
4839000	4840000	All right.
4840000	4853000	And I think at least for me, one of the huge questions that was somehow the elephant in the room is the question of which kind of political economy are we talking about?
4853000	4857000	You call your proposal platform socialism.
4857000	4875000	And at one point you state a genuinely emancipatory economy with democratic control over investment worker owned firms and other forms of cooperative associations would not need to completely abolish private property or markets.
4875000	4887000	And this was highly interesting to me, I have to say, because it kind of suggests that what you are describing might actually be some sort of radical social democracy rather than socialism.
4887000	4895000	At least if the abolition of private property of the means of production is a defining feature of socialism.
4895000	4905000	Also, if there are markets, the term market socialism comes into mind with all the problems inherent in this concept, at least in my understanding.
4905000	4913000	Now, I do understand, as you argued in this interview over and over again, that you promote a pluralism and I love it.
4913000	4917000	It's a very good approach, I guess, to promote pluralism.
4917000	4931000	But I still ask myself whether or not there is an inherent danger of falling back into a rule of capital if there still is private property and markets.
4931000	4936000	Yes, I think you're right to question what we might mean here by pluralism.
4936000	4949000	And a skeptic might ask, is platform socialism actually just a kind of unstable form of social democracy in which capitalist power would remain dominant?
4949000	4954000	And I think the first thing to note is that there's no pure form of anything, right?
4954000	4965000	Whether it's free market capitalism or market socialism or whatever, everything in practice is some kind of messy hybrid with different contradictory elements that kind of make it up.
4965000	4975000	And so I think it's important to note that when I say something wouldn't be abolished, that doesn't necessarily mean that would be allowed to dominate, right?
4975000	4980000	So let's think about how any kind of transition might take place.
4980000	4993000	When we're thinking about a transition to a different way of organizing the economy, it's going to necessarily go through a period in which there are going to be competing logics for how economic power is exercised.
4993000	4998000	You know, just like the messy transition from feudalism to capitalism, right?
4998000	5005000	So elements of capitalism might remain in new hybrid configurations.
5005000	5018000	But the idea ultimately is that the logic of profit making and capitalist accumulation is going to gradually become subordinated to the need for democratic control over economic production.
5019000	5032000	So, you know, when I think about platform socialism, it's about the growth of a network of democratically run organizations where citizens are going to be able to exercise direct control over this production.
5032000	5039000	And so this idea of pluralism is kind of, I guess it's like a safety valve in a way.
5039000	5042000	It's like it's allowing for pockets of resistance.
5042000	5057000	It's allowing for pockets of different ways of doing things, while still trying to hold on to a kind of hegemonic project of organizing society in a particular way that promotes social justice.
5057000	5066000	And so I think that's why I have this kind of, you know, I also I kind of flirt with perhaps the idea of a kind of mixed economy.
5066000	5075000	When we hear that phrase mixed economy, we're used to thinking about economies in which the private ownership dominates over the public.
5075000	5079000	But there's no necessary reason why that has to be the case in all mixed economies, right?
5079000	5093000	We can have a mixed economy in which the cooperative and the public is the major form of ownership and productive activity in which there are small pockets of private ownership, maybe small and medium enterprises.
5093000	5102000	And there have been kind of, you know, historical examples of this happening in terms of this is kind of the private property in terms of the markets.
5102000	5108000	So one question is, I think we can quickly differentiate between markets in production goods.
5108000	5113000	So these intermediary goods that kind of go into consumer products and markets and consumption goods.
5113000	5130000	So it's more than possible to kind of have, you know, have some kind of consumer choice and job choice and some of these kinds of things without necessarily enabling capitalists to have control over people's labor and control over investment, right?
5131000	5145000	Because the most important thing you want is to have democratic control over production goods, over the kinds of allocation of resources and investment decisions that are being made by the billionaires, by the investment firms and so on.
5145000	5148000	And I think that's really the kind of core question, right?
5148000	5155000	Because enabling a certain degree of consumer markets, I mean, you might, you know, there might be forms of socialism that don't have that.
5155000	5168000	And, you know, I think that's probably Marx and Engel's original idea was not to have any kind of markets, but they're not necessarily the same thing as having a privatized market for production goods, right?
5168000	5170000	So there are some differences there.
5170000	5177000	I probably don't want to get into the market socialism debate just because there are so many different forms of market socialism.
5177000	5201000	I think it's just really about trying to emphasize that the transition to forms of social ownership over productive assets is really about trying to find ways for this, you know, to reverse these processes of commodification and privatization, to establish forms of democracy and accountability over how resources are allocated.
5201000	5207000	It's for me hard to get an idea of how this would actually work out.
5207000	5217000	I mean, I do absolutely understand the argument that within the transformational period, there of course will always be some form of hybrid.
5217000	5234000	But still, the question remains whether or not certain principles within capitalism will still be fundamental principles of societal organization within what you call platform socialism.
5234000	5246000	For example, if you have cooperatives within capitalism, those cooperatives are still forced to compete with each other for profit.
5246000	5271000	And if this as a basic principle is still in place, then you will certainly inherit many, many, many of the problems that go along with it, even though you do have a certainly better setup than your usual for-profit corporation that has no democratic structuring within the workplace at all.
5271000	5287000	So this, of course, is a very beneficial trade-off, but still it remains to be somewhat lacking a truly different functional logic within the basic premises of how these things are organized.
5287000	5316000	So what I'm asking myself is that if you allow markets and capital as such to exist within what you call platform socialism, that these structural principles of exploitation of for-profit organization and so on, that they will still develop a great deal of destructive force.
5316000	5330000	And are likely not something that really works as a coexistence because, I mean, if this worked out, we probably had it already.
5330000	5359000	I mean, in the social democratic way of framing political economy, this is the basic principle that you just stated, that there would be some form of possibility to reign in the power of these conglomerates of capital as such, and that you can come to a place where the alternative logic is powerful enough to be dominant.
5359000	5363000	But this is not how it plays out in reality.
5363000	5375000	In reality, you had these so-called golden years, which were not golden for most of the people and maybe a little bit golden for some of social democracy after the Second World War.
5375000	5389000	But this was also in the context of the Cold War, where they had to give some kind of trade-offs in order to not have people go over to communist ideals in masses.
5389000	5412000	So I do not think that this idea of coexistence really works out for the benefit of all of us and that there is a certain danger inherent in remaining these organizational principles of capital to be left untouched.
5412000	5416000	Do you want me to respond to that?
5416000	5420000	Yes, please. It's not really a question in that sense.
5420000	5433000	It's just that I'm not sure if this is really going far enough, because I really share the way that you dissect the critics.
5433000	5450000	You always get to a point where you actually show them how it is really important to ask the question of property and within the proposals you give, you do provide this idea of alternative structuring of property.
5450000	5467000	But when it comes to this question of alternative political economy, like in a more general sense and a more encompassing sense, I'm not sure if the ideas that you sketch are actually going far enough.
5467000	5474000	So I think I partly disagree with your characterization of the system I describe in platform socialism.
5474000	5477000	So I think I share your concerns.
5477000	5479000	I share your concerns.
5479000	5484000	On the one hand, you will have critics saying the proposal is too utopian.
5484000	5487000	It's too far removed from our existing reality.
5487000	5493000	Nothing like that has ever been achieved and therefore nothing like that will ever be achieved.
5493000	5498000	And then on the other hand, you might have critics that say you're still talking about money.
5498000	5501000	You're still talking about consumer goods.
5501000	5515000	This is not what Marx and Engels described, right, that they talk about a moneyless, seemingly marketless economy in which there's just kind of social production to meet people's needs.
5515000	5531000	So I think on this particular problem of this unstable hybrid, I don't think it's quite the case that the solution I propose is this socialism and capitalism unhappily coexisting together.
5531000	5539000	When I say that there wouldn't be a market in production goods, there would be democratic control over investment.
5539000	5546000	That removes the predominant power of capitalists in my view.
5546000	5570000	And when you don't have the power to command labor, when you don't have the power for most sectors of the economy, for the largest industries, for the kind of investment, finance, industrial production, all these big sectors, the economic and social power you can exercise is going to be vastly diminished.
5570000	5576000	Think of something like the new economic policy in Russia, right, in kind of like early 1920s.
5576000	5583000	You know, there's a degree of private enterprise which is kind of tolerated, but that does not mean it's dominating.
5583000	5591000	That does not mean it is, you know, it is like about to overtake the principle of social ownership, for example.
5591000	5600000	Now, I don't think, you know, unlike some recent commentaries, I don't think 1910s and 20s Russia is necessarily the best example for us to return to.
5600000	5605000	I think I'm much more kind of like social democrat at heart.
5605000	5615000	So I can see that, and you know, I think I do have a kind of a small social democrat on one of my shoulders and a kind of small federalist anarchist on the other shoulder.
5615000	5616000	And they both say things to me.
5616000	5621000	So I will acknowledge that there are kind of tensions there.
5621000	5635000	And I also think that there isn't necessarily one concrete system that I propose in the book, right, like I try to give a kind of choice space within which we might start to develop certain ideas.
5635000	5649000	So I don't know if I would call it an institutional model as much as a kind of a strategic discussion about the kinds of systems that we might want to start to develop or move towards.
5649000	5663000	But I'm not I'm not sure I agree that it's like it's necessarily susceptible to this critique that it's an unstable mix of capitalism, socialism, because I think as soon as you start talking about democratic control over investment production goods, I think.
5663000	5679000	Even if there are spaces of tolerance for slightly different ways of organizing things, the hegemonic position is still one that I think enables a kind of adjust kind of scenario to occur.
5679000	5691000	Would there still be, to make it a bit concrete, would there still be like large masses of capital in the hands of some, because then you immediately run into problems like the capital strike?
5691000	5698000	Yeah, no, I don't. So to be clear, no, that's not what I have in mind. So there is a little section you would recall socializing capital funds.
5698000	5705000	And really, I mean, I've thought that the problem with this would be that it went too far, right? Like you're talking about expropriating billionaires.
5705000	5719000	I'm like, should I be writing this? Is this really something that? But I think you absolutely have to do that, right? Because that's why social democracy ultimately has always fallen back on itself because the threat of capital strikes.
5719000	5731000	And every time you see radical elements of social democracy pushing at the edges of socialism, pushing at the edges of economic democracy, you see threatened or actual capital strikes.
5731000	5740000	You know, with the Meidner Plan, with the kind of some of the Mitterrand stuff in France in the 80s, it never works because capital always grinds things to a halt.
5740000	5751000	So I think I mean, I thought it was it was like way out there. So I'm surprised. But I guess this is probably the podcast that I would be challenged from an even more leftist position.
5751000	5762000	I mean, to be clear, I absolutely do not think that you're too utopian because you're absolutely brilliant in giving us the concrete examples on how we could approach these things.
5762000	5772000	And for me, most of them are within the realm of transformation. So I do not fall into the camp of people that might say this is too utopian.
5772000	5785000	And I neither fall into the camp of people who say this is like not as Marx intended because we are talking about how this might work in the here and now and how we would love to play things out in the most ideal scenario.
5785000	5792000	So if I'm not an artist, it's not about orthodoxy. So so this is not of any importance to me.
5792000	5807000	But what I do think is that some of the proposals that you put out there will run into problems if they do not go far enough in abolishing,
5807000	5826000	for example, markets and abolishing any like for profit principle as a basic logic within the organizational structure of how things work out and within this broader ecology of political economy.
5826000	5835000	And I think that's just simply something that we will have to figure out maybe either along the way or in discussions just like that.
5835000	5847000	Because as I understand it, platform socialism, as you describe it, is not intended to be a description of a complete political economies or something like that.
5847000	5852000	Yeah, sure. I can see where you're coming from. I can see the concern.
5852000	5859000	I also think the focus of the theory is that that kind of mezzo level of organizations, how organizations would work.
5860000	5865000	It's also about giving concrete descriptions of actual services, how they would occur.
5865000	5873000	And so, yeah, there's there's obviously still room room to maneuver at the kind of, you know, big picture level as well.
5873000	5884000	Because ultimately, when I wanted to describe platform socialism, I wanted to focus on the digital economy as a kind of example of the kind of vanguard in many respects of capitalism.
5884000	5889000	An example of the kind of industries and the kind of organizations that we might want to tackle.
5889000	5899000	So, yeah, it's not a kind of like academics account of the entire theoretical framework of every economic principle, how it would all operate, right?
5899000	5903000	Like it's a text for a general audience.
5903000	5920000	And so I try and, you know, draw the right balance between, you know, not boring the reader to death with like every every organizational principle, but still trying to give enough flesh on the bones to make people feel like this is actually something that could work.
5920000	5927000	My last question that I share with everybody is if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
5927000	5929000	What makes me joyful?
5929000	5941000	Well, I think one of the things about platform socialism for me and the process of writing the book is trying to break with this like really generalized cynicism that that our era has particularly towards technology.
5941000	5947000	I think we need to be able to imagine a future in which we liberate technology from capitalism.
5947000	5967000	And part of this is about creating our own imaginary and our own spaces in which people can experiment with technology and find new ways of relating to it and building it and developing it and tinkering with it outside of the Silicon Valley mindset that everything has to be about creating a startup, having a public listing and making billions of dollars.
5967000	5979000	So, I don't know, one thing I'm excited about is the potential for, you know, these new experiments that are going on around us and what they could bring in the next decade and the kinds of communities they could support.
5979000	5995000	Because, as I said before, socialism is a struggle for freedom and it's ultimately about allowing us to kind of live our best lives, to flourish and to produce amazing art and culture and to have new projects.
5995000	6004000	And I really think that that's kind of part of this inventive, innovative spirit of platform capitalism.
