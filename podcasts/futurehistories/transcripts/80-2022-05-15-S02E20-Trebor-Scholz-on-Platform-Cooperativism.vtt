Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to

00:05.560 --> 00:10.480
welcome Trevor Schultz in today's episode. Trevor is the author of

00:10.480 --> 00:15.960
Uber worked and underpaid how workers are disrupting the digital economy and

00:15.960 --> 00:21.760
editor of multiple books such as hours to hack and to own platform

00:21.760 --> 00:27.960
cooperativism a new vision for the future of work and a fairer internet. He

00:27.960 --> 00:32.160
is professor at the New School in New York and founding director of the

00:32.160 --> 00:37.560

00:37.560 --> 00:43.740
Digital Economy both of them at the New School as well. In general Trevor is

00:43.740 --> 00:47.840
highly involved in the platform cooperativism movement which will be at

00:47.840 --> 00:52.800
the center of our conversation today. Before we start I would like to thank

00:52.800 --> 00:57.960

thank you very much it's highly appreciated and now please enjoy today's

01:33.080 --> 01:39.200
episode with Trevor Schultz on platform cooperativism.

01:42.800 --> 01:49.120
Welcome Trevor. Hello thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Trevor let's start

01:49.200 --> 01:56.000
with the definition. What is a platform cooperative? Right so there I guess this

01:56.000 --> 02:02.640
is sort of a three-part question right so I mean you know like people need to

02:02.640 --> 02:08.160
understand what cooperatives are in the first place so here this is I'm mostly

02:08.160 --> 02:13.760
focusing on two types of cooperatives there are many more mostly interested in

02:14.320 --> 02:21.680
worker cooperatives where the company is owned by the workers that all have an

02:21.680 --> 02:28.480
equal say in the operation so it's based on the principle of one worker one vote

02:29.600 --> 02:37.040
and so it's democratic ownership right and then the second type of cooperative

02:37.040 --> 02:41.360
that I think is most relevant to the digital economy and a good example of a

02:41.360 --> 02:46.960
platform cooperative is multi-stakeholder cooperatives so this means that there you

02:46.960 --> 02:55.600
don't have this wall around a small number of members who all like benefit from this

02:56.960 --> 03:01.440
this cooperative form right by having higher wages or by having

03:04.240 --> 03:09.840
secure place to work and by having a voice in the workplace which is like really quite rare

03:12.240 --> 03:18.640
when you think about it globally and when you think about how this idea of participatory

03:18.640 --> 03:25.920
democracy has propagated like across countries right so who claim this concept right as as

03:26.480 --> 03:32.320
something that is very central to their aspiration but in the workplace where most people spend like

03:32.320 --> 03:40.560
most of their day that is like quite absent right and most workplaces so quite fascinating

03:40.560 --> 03:46.560
so that's cooperative so with a focus on multi-stakeholder cooperatives and worker

03:46.560 --> 03:54.400
corps multi-stakeholder cooperatives including also people from the community that are so not

03:54.400 --> 04:01.760
just a small number of the members but it can also have classes within the cooperative that are

04:02.320 --> 04:08.320
that are you know like in the community that are other you know other than the workers

04:08.880 --> 04:18.000
you know so and that breaks with this idea that cooperatives can only benefit a small number of

04:18.000 --> 04:25.360
members and there are you know tens of thousands of examples of that in italy with social

04:25.360 --> 04:34.160
cooperatives and i mean really all over the world yeah so and so that's a cooperative then

04:34.160 --> 04:39.120
a platform cooperative is really like a digital platform now we also think about you know web

04:39.120 --> 04:49.920
three like with protocols and other technologies but a company for whom the digital operation is

04:50.000 --> 04:56.640
central number one so it's not you know a cooperative with a website or so right so

04:56.640 --> 05:03.040
like really where the that's at the heart of their operation as a business and they followed the

05:03.840 --> 05:10.160
cooperative principles that were you know designed by the international cooperative alliance

05:10.560 --> 05:21.200
so essentially those yeah two two characteristics and could you give us an example of a platform

05:21.200 --> 05:32.560
cooperative maybe yeah absolutely so there's a you know wonderful project and in europe it's called

05:32.640 --> 05:41.600
uh it's called smart which is in nine european countries and it's focused on freelancers and

05:41.600 --> 05:52.240
it's makes this very interesting move of building on this sort of legal a legal hack you might call

05:52.240 --> 06:02.720
it to transform freelancers so to speak into employees so that means basically they give

06:02.720 --> 06:11.760
freelancers employee status by making them employees of the cooperative and thereby affording

06:11.760 --> 06:17.360
them all the benefit under labor law that are significant in some countries not so significant

06:17.360 --> 06:23.600
in others so it really depends but including things like unemployment right and

06:28.080 --> 06:34.320
you know it's i mean labor law is in most countries designed mostly for employees and

06:34.320 --> 06:40.000
not for freelancers so freelancers do are not protected right and this move to make them

06:40.000 --> 06:47.600
employees essentially grants them that right so that's smart they're doing that specific to

06:47.600 --> 06:53.600
each country like so in italy and spain and germany mostly in belgium that's where most

06:53.600 --> 07:01.600
members are and also in france and they have 35 000 members they you know wrote over 100 000

07:01.600 --> 07:09.200
contracts and have like a revenue of 200 million euros a year so quite a significant operation

07:09.200 --> 07:15.600
they have co-working spaces for freelancers and so they are let's say an opera singer and

07:17.280 --> 07:26.800
you get engaged by like an opera house or so you basically the the co-op the platform co-op

07:27.360 --> 07:35.360
acts as your employer and the opera house essentially interacts with the co-op not with

07:35.360 --> 07:43.760
the freelancer so the the money then goes to to smart and smart pays the freelancer a salary

07:43.760 --> 07:53.040
so this has the advantage that often freelancers suffer from not being paid on time and the

07:54.960 --> 08:02.080
in smart's case they pay seven days after the work is performed no matter if that

08:02.720 --> 08:10.240
organization has paid or not so and as smart is quite significantly large

08:10.240 --> 08:15.120
nobody really dares to not pay because they would be added to a blacklist right which then no

08:15.120 --> 08:21.840
freelancer would work with them so it's it takes the anxiety out of freelancing too

08:22.960 --> 08:29.760
interesting model and when you were talking about the definition of platform cooperatives

08:29.760 --> 08:36.800
you mentioned multi-stakeholder cooperatives and you said that there are different you said classes

08:36.800 --> 08:43.200
within the multi-stakeholder cooperative what is the kind of representation that these classes are

08:44.000 --> 08:51.280
involved with because i mean this might be a form of ownership a part of ownership or it might be

08:51.840 --> 08:58.400
something different like really taking part within the the the structures that form the

08:58.480 --> 09:02.320
the given cooperative so are there different models of representation as well

09:03.920 --> 09:12.720
yeah that's a good question so one platform co-op that is in the process of converting from a worker

09:12.720 --> 09:20.480
from an italian worker co-op of tech workers to a multi-stakeholder platform co-op is fair bnb

09:21.440 --> 09:29.920
which as the name suggests right offers short-term rental and 50 percent of the revenues

09:29.920 --> 09:37.680
go to local communities so for projects that the community can decide on such as whatever you know

09:37.680 --> 09:43.600
building a playground or you know whatever the community wants so that so that the

09:44.400 --> 09:50.640
the money the revenue that is generated is not simply going to silicon valley right as it does

09:50.640 --> 09:59.040
with the competitor but stays in that community so the way they are doing this is quite obvious

09:59.040 --> 10:06.720
right so this is where the hosts of course would be a class right and and then potentially the

10:06.720 --> 10:12.880
guests as well and then what you point to is a complicated question which is really not so easy

10:12.880 --> 10:19.280
to answer because it really differs from from co-op to co-op so like how you know do they are

10:19.280 --> 10:27.680
for example also non-voting classes right so that you have actually you know stakeholders that

10:28.480 --> 10:34.480
you know they are let's say really involved with the company but they but they don't have voting

10:34.480 --> 10:42.000
rights right that also exists so it's it's it's complicated as i can't really generalize on that

10:42.000 --> 10:46.800
but it's it gives you the way to you know but everybody is still part of it right so in

10:47.520 --> 10:57.040
like a wonderful example of this is also in the italian mountain ranges like in so many countries

10:58.320 --> 11:07.360
in the rural areas right so there are many small towns that have a significant retention problem

11:07.360 --> 11:12.560
right so people are leaving and were so it makes it very hard for the people that

11:12.560 --> 11:20.560
stay that are left behind to still operate let's say the restaurant the cinema the hotel etc

11:21.280 --> 11:28.320
and so they form cooperatives right they form one cooperative like a community cooperative

11:28.320 --> 11:35.200
that does everything so the same person might work as part of this cooperative

11:36.080 --> 11:43.520
in a restaurant in the afternoon or in the evening you know might be a shepherd in the morning

11:44.560 --> 11:52.080
and maybe work in the post office at lunch or so you know so essentially and this is important

11:52.080 --> 12:01.840
right cooperatives always emerged in moments of crisis right so they they emerge when like the

12:01.840 --> 12:12.640
government or markets fail or even in the global south like support networks or families fail

12:13.200 --> 12:19.840
then you have you know people turn to each other and and and found cooperatives in the

12:19.840 --> 12:26.560
united states in the 1930s a significant part of rural america was not electrified

12:27.120 --> 12:35.600
because the big utility companies didn't find it lucrative enough to electrify this last village

12:35.600 --> 12:42.640
in montana right this just didn't pay right and so you know with the help of president roosevelt

12:42.640 --> 12:50.640
at the time who wrote legislation making that easier people in those rural areas got together

12:50.640 --> 12:58.800
and founded rural electric cooperatives and this is how over 40 of the electric grid in the united

12:58.800 --> 13:04.800
states today is cooperative so essentially like there was a there was a problem and

13:05.760 --> 13:13.040
the market right did wasn't interested to solve this problem and so people had to take it on

13:13.040 --> 13:18.880
themselves and this is very important to understand because that is a very different framing than

13:19.600 --> 13:26.160
creating a tech startup to dominate the world and you know extract from communities worldwide

13:26.960 --> 13:34.880
and out-compete the competition and be like that let's say like one startup that dominates the

13:34.880 --> 13:40.320
sector it's a totally different way of thinking right so it's that's not why they ever emerged

13:41.040 --> 13:50.720
and one thing is to have one cooperative but what you are working on goes beyond that because

13:51.680 --> 13:58.480
what you're involved in and what you kind of co-founded i guess is a form of movement so

13:58.480 --> 14:06.400
platform cooperativism is a form of movement and i would be interested in what is the state of

14:06.480 --> 14:11.040
things when it comes to platform cooperativism as a movement and specifically

14:11.840 --> 14:19.040
going into the question of how do you succeed in networking the different cooperatives with each

14:19.040 --> 14:25.760
other and therefore kind of creating some form of i don't know a better word but synergy effect or

14:25.760 --> 14:31.360
something that goes beyond what one cooperative might be able to do and create something that

14:31.360 --> 14:37.120
points towards maybe even an alternative form of political economy as such

14:39.200 --> 14:48.640
yeah wonderful questions yeah so it's i think the big vision for this work is really

14:50.320 --> 14:57.120
pluralist cooperative commonwealth and so i think what you point out is essential

14:57.120 --> 15:06.080
because it's so we are working with over 500 businesses and there are many more that we are

15:06.080 --> 15:14.080
aware of in two countries and so there are tens of thousands of people involved it's

15:14.960 --> 15:22.880
truly global there are definitely challenges and which have to do with startup funding

15:22.880 --> 15:31.040
right so like because the venture capitalist model banks on you know investing it's in

15:31.040 --> 15:37.760
like for a venture capitalist to invest in 10 projects and seven of them failing two of them

15:37.760 --> 15:44.160
succeeding moderately and one having this like windfall of money so profit which which will

15:44.160 --> 15:50.480
just never be the case with cooperatives because that's just not that's just against the principles

15:51.440 --> 16:00.480
and so just with like these other projects that i described earlier it's a community right that

16:00.480 --> 16:07.920
sees that that having this business creating this business solves the problem that nobody else is

16:07.920 --> 16:16.480
willing to solve for them right so like these social cooperatives in italy that i mentioned

16:16.480 --> 16:21.520
earlier when i talked about multi-stakeholder cooperatives i think there are 11 000 of them

16:23.760 --> 16:32.400
much of that emerged in after 2008 when italy significantly reduced its budget for social care

16:33.440 --> 16:40.000
so there are lots of cooperatives that emerge to help people with disabilities to have jobs elder

16:40.000 --> 16:50.000
care etc so yeah so but to to come so so basically people see that there's a need

16:50.000 --> 16:56.160
and they put their money together so it's crowd equity right so now there are also experiments

16:56.720 --> 17:04.720
like in new york city where a lift competitor a taxi platform called drivers cooperative

17:04.720 --> 17:15.440
has over 4 000 drivers and and they have taken a significant amount of investor funding

17:16.240 --> 17:21.200
traditional investors who want to see profit but they did not give them controlling interest right

17:21.200 --> 17:27.360
so they they can contribute but they will not control the business right and that's

17:27.360 --> 17:30.320
that's what really matters with cooperatives right i mean you can take

17:31.280 --> 17:37.600
uh this money maybe even from a municipality so i think there are there are thoughts in that

17:37.600 --> 17:43.680
direction as well like why couldn't um i don't know the city of hamburg or

17:44.880 --> 17:53.920
others be a class in one of those cooperatives now this is quite controversial for like you know

17:53.920 --> 17:59.200
people with a sort of co-op dogma they would not agree to them but i think it's interesting as long

17:59.200 --> 18:03.840
as there is no as long as there is no controlling interest i think it would be wonderful

18:03.840 --> 18:09.200
when municipalities get involved right so we are working with municipalities because you ask of

18:09.200 --> 18:14.000
the state of things um we're particularly interested in municipalities where this is

18:14.000 --> 18:20.720
really supported right so obviously the regulatory framework is really important for for this to

18:20.720 --> 18:28.320
thrive and uh it just happens that this is particularly the case and emilia romagna in

18:28.320 --> 18:37.120
italy so the area around bologna which you know some people frame as co-op valley right so sort

18:37.120 --> 18:46.320
of antidote to silicon valley and with platform corps like concerning a teacher but also fear bmb

18:46.320 --> 18:53.680
and others but then also carola in the south of india which is a very progressive state which

18:53.760 --> 18:58.960
has added platform corps to their government directive which means that we will help them

18:58.960 --> 19:04.640
my organization will help them my institute will help them to to implement and some 4000

19:04.640 --> 19:12.320
platform corps in the next five years that's their goal and then there's california and

19:13.280 --> 19:19.920
also now there's work in bonas arias so like on argentina more broadly and then there's a lot

19:19.920 --> 19:26.400
going on in brazil as well like so rio de janeiro sapaulo uh state the states of rio de janeiro

19:26.400 --> 19:34.000
and sapaulo so um these are sort of the highlights right but it's you know also the netherlands and

19:35.360 --> 19:44.240
and uh finland are of course also very open to this work states countries like kenya have uh

19:44.960 --> 19:50.960
i think 48 percent of gdp in kenya is cooperative so it's significantly a cooperative culture

19:52.560 --> 19:58.000
there is an organization like a sister organization of the platform corp consortium now also in

19:59.040 --> 20:08.560
in berlin in germany and the platform corps uh germany uh it's called and um there's now also

20:09.120 --> 20:12.880
you know there's a platform corps uh platform corp consortium in hong kong

20:13.520 --> 20:23.680
there's uh just uh one starting now in indonesia in java and so it's sort of in many

20:23.680 --> 20:30.480
many different places and i think right now i think people are really interested and i taught

20:30.560 --> 20:37.360
a course on this just a few weeks ago uh on this overlap with web3 technologies

20:38.720 --> 20:48.240
so how can dao's wide distributed autonomous organizations inform platform corps in terms

20:48.240 --> 20:54.560
of their governance perhaps and i think many people in that space many technologists in that

20:54.560 --> 21:02.320
space mistake what they are doing for cooperatives often not so clear on what a cooperative actually

21:02.320 --> 21:09.680
is so but that sort of helps a little bit because people get more interested and open and also

21:10.240 --> 21:18.880
thinking about how one could organize data cooperatively so how could you have cooperative

21:18.880 --> 21:29.440
data trusts so this is essentially like a group of people creating a small pool of data and then

21:29.440 --> 21:37.680
giving like fiduciary rights over those data through a bomb to the cooperative or some other

21:37.680 --> 21:44.640
entity so these are all like experiments right like this is just starting but that's sort of the

21:44.640 --> 21:52.560
state of things we we had some small successes let's say with policymakers so

21:55.280 --> 22:01.520
andrea nales made when she was the leader of the social democrats

22:03.200 --> 22:10.800
you know added platform corps to the you know part of the vision of the spd

22:10.800 --> 22:20.240
uh but you know her candidacy wasn't her leadership wasn't exactly thriving wasn't

22:20.240 --> 22:27.120
but it's uh but nevertheless you know she did that and so we tried to pick up on that the labor

22:27.120 --> 22:34.240
party uh under corbin and also under the current leadership still has it as their vision for the

22:34.320 --> 22:45.360
internet is one of their 10 guiding posts for that so so yeah so stuff going on in the policy level

22:46.240 --> 22:50.800
we have an institute at the new school the institute for the cooperative digital economy

22:50.800 --> 22:55.760
which has like a fellowship program so we are just about to announce our new cohort

22:56.400 --> 23:01.760
which will essentially research exactly what i just talked about so like all of these little

23:01.760 --> 23:09.280
points i had this is what they're all time and i guess one very interesting topic for further

23:09.280 --> 23:13.360
research would be the question of governance because this is something i'm really interested

23:13.360 --> 23:20.480
in because i mean it's pretty easy to imagine like smaller scale structures of cooperatives

23:20.480 --> 23:26.480
where people are involved in the really involved in the governance of the given cooperative but

23:26.560 --> 23:32.160
the more things get scaled up and the bigger the the organization gets the more difficult

23:32.160 --> 23:39.360
it becomes to imagine a like meaningful um meaningfully taking part within the governance

23:39.360 --> 23:45.520
structure and the self-governance of the whole thing so are there experiments with like large

23:45.520 --> 23:54.240
scale self-governed um platform cooperatives and what are the takeaways of of these large-scale

23:54.240 --> 24:00.560
platform cooperatives because i imagine you you run into very different problems once things get

24:00.560 --> 24:07.840
bigger well that that um it's not just a question of for governance but it's also a question of

24:07.840 --> 24:14.480
scaling right and so how do we think of scaling and it's really it's really um important to

24:15.360 --> 24:21.200
detach yourself from the i guess silicon valley's thinking because it's co-op scale very differently

24:21.200 --> 24:30.880
so they scale worldwide um through federations and alliances and collaborations so in a way that

24:30.880 --> 24:39.440
is drastically different to anything uh coming out of silicon valley so the the traditional platform

24:41.440 --> 24:49.440
as you may say has uh is an umbrella right an umbrella of many small cooperatives so

24:49.440 --> 24:53.520
let's take for example and i gave that example in my chat talk when you if you want to

24:54.480 --> 25:01.440
hear this a bit more in detail about this cleaning cooperative in new york and it's essentially three

25:02.080 --> 25:10.320
very small worker co-ops and they sit under this umbrella of this second level cooperative the

25:10.320 --> 25:18.160
platform co-op that's its own entity and each of the three groups uh has a representative to the

25:18.160 --> 25:25.360
board of the platform co-op so and then this is how they all decide then how this platform

25:25.360 --> 25:32.320
corpus operated which really functions more as a labor supply for them right so it allows them

25:32.320 --> 25:40.000
access to jobs better jobs uh better gigs than they would have gotten than when they would have

25:40.080 --> 25:47.920
pinned a flyer to a tree right so they reach more affluent clients that can pay them more

25:47.920 --> 25:53.440
and then this is something we have mentioned yet you know allows them to make twice as much as

25:53.440 --> 26:00.320
they used to make before so this is often the case with worker platform co-ops in that way they

26:00.960 --> 26:07.600
in care and in cleaning right they make twice as much okay so how do they scale like well

26:07.600 --> 26:16.240
like this sort of federal federation is is one model of scaling and it allows them to still

26:16.240 --> 26:23.120
retain this interpersonal trust and um and friendships uh that are so important to

26:23.120 --> 26:32.000
cooperatives so they are much more resilient than other business forms uh which is the research

26:32.000 --> 26:37.280
show set after 2008 like there were far fewer cooperatives that went bankrupt than other

26:37.280 --> 26:41.920
businesses and you know it's not that they have any magic sauce or anything it's just that they

26:42.480 --> 26:48.320
you know they they suck it up right so they stick together and they want this business to succeed

26:48.320 --> 26:54.480
because and you could say this a bit more pompously uh because they have a purpose right

26:55.360 --> 26:59.840
i mean it's not it's not about business it's not about profit right it's about purpose

27:00.560 --> 27:10.240
and um and so uh and that's also what you see with other groups and in in india for example

27:10.240 --> 27:19.440
we work with the seva federation and uh that seva is a federation of cooperatives and a union

27:19.440 --> 27:28.240
so the union is uh has over a million members and the co-op federation has over 300 000 members

27:28.320 --> 27:34.560
and well that's another topic altogether like how those two uh bodies act right like

27:35.440 --> 27:44.880
i would you need a union and it turns out to be a very good idea but um the the point here is that

27:45.440 --> 27:56.960
this is also over 105 cooperatives in this federation of several several men so and together

27:56.960 --> 28:03.520
they for example with covid right like coordinated their help efforts to you know provide

28:04.240 --> 28:11.920
workers with money and food and you know medical supplies like masks etc sanitizer hand sanitizer

28:12.640 --> 28:21.200
so um that really makes sense and another huge cooperative federation in india is amul which is

28:22.080 --> 28:28.960
i think the largest milk producer in the world and it's 1.7 million milk producers

28:28.960 --> 28:36.400
small milk producers all networked in this federation and so so i mean i can talk a lot

28:36.400 --> 28:42.560
about that there's lots of examples in italy as well that illustrate this well where essentially

28:43.360 --> 28:48.640
like most italian businesses are very small but then they federate to be able to compete with

28:48.640 --> 28:58.480
larger companies but with the web3 right you have like another thing coming and i'm not sure i would

28:58.480 --> 29:03.760
call those cooperatives but they they are i think it's an interesting thing to explore and they

29:03.760 --> 29:09.840
could work in that direction where through blockchain you can split ownership across

29:10.720 --> 29:15.200
i don't know hundreds of thousands of people right so uh i don't know if you followed this

29:15.200 --> 29:21.760
at all in the united states there was an attempt to buy the constitution so i think there are i

29:21.760 --> 29:29.920
don't know how many copies probably a dozen or so which were printed uh you know initially

29:30.880 --> 29:40.480
and uh they i think it was 40 million dollars for one copy and uh this online group that tried to

29:40.480 --> 29:47.680
purchase it they raised 19 million which you know is not 40 million but they raised 19 million

29:47.680 --> 29:54.000
dollars right i mean that is incredible and uh so then they set their next targets on buying a soccer

29:54.000 --> 30:04.960
team uh jointly and then uh a vacation resort like a spa in florida uh that they wanted to jointly

30:04.960 --> 30:09.520
buy so i think nobody really knows it's just i think it has something to do that you can

30:09.520 --> 30:15.600
you can do that with blockchain right um what that would look like and i think it's completely

30:15.600 --> 30:21.680
unresolved how how people would then vote that's it let's say they managed to buy this result that

30:21.680 --> 30:28.720
now what right i mean so how do they run it um that would be a huge experiment but i think to

30:28.720 --> 30:33.920
to split i think the huge the really interesting question is like it's the research is really

30:33.920 --> 30:40.640
clear that like worker corps and to an extent multi-stakeholder corps are better businesses

30:40.640 --> 30:46.480
for people right i mean that's so you know like it's you know more sustainable it's better for

30:46.480 --> 30:53.680
the planet it's uh they are they're better jobs there's dignity in the workplace uh you know

30:53.680 --> 31:03.520
people are treated as human beings but it's it's it's not um you know obviously as large

31:03.520 --> 31:11.440
as corporations and so well this this would be an interesting way to scale as well right through

31:12.640 --> 31:20.880
this type of like ownership fractals if you want you know uh but like i said there isn't really

31:20.880 --> 31:26.400
an example yet of where that is actually happening but it's very promising interesting

31:28.080 --> 31:33.440
yeah well i understand the interest the initial interest i'm highly skeptical i have to say because

31:33.440 --> 31:40.000
i mean it's it it still very much stays within a very particular paradigm of private ownership and

31:40.000 --> 31:49.920
then uh is able more or less to spread uh this over a given asset so to speak but well let's

31:49.920 --> 31:58.480
let's say um it's always interesting to see experimentation i guess um so you mentioned

31:59.120 --> 32:05.920
that platform cooperatives are the better businesses um because they are very much

32:05.920 --> 32:15.200
oriented towards a humane setting within one works and gets paid and has social interactions

32:15.200 --> 32:20.960
and so forth and so on so what i think is really great about platform cooperatives is that they

32:20.960 --> 32:28.400
offer a very concrete alternative in the here and now and um that they also by doing that represent

32:28.400 --> 32:36.880
some form of let's say building block for how transformations to post-capitalist futures might

32:36.880 --> 32:43.760
actually look like so i really really love that but at the same time it's important to ask and

32:43.760 --> 32:51.040
also to be aware of what exactly they they are able to do for what kind of things they might be

32:51.040 --> 32:57.680
a solution and for what they might not be a solution so what are the what the what the

32:57.680 --> 33:03.680
boundaries of of this concept are i heard an interview with you in in which you said that you

33:03.680 --> 33:10.800
are often asked whether platform cooperativism is an alternative to uber google facebook etc

33:10.800 --> 33:14.960
and in at least in this interview you you replied that this is the wrong question

33:15.680 --> 33:21.280
and so i would like to to frame it a little differently and the question would then be if

33:21.280 --> 33:28.720
you consider platform cooperatives as a solution for certain kinds of social problems um for

33:29.760 --> 33:38.400
which problems might they be a solution and for which problems maybe not right i mean if you want

33:38.400 --> 33:47.360
to run a platform or start a platform and you have an interest in a social justice lens

33:48.080 --> 33:54.640
or if that is your mission if you're interested in social justice right then i think there isn't

33:54.640 --> 34:02.880
a question that that's really the model to go with right but you know obviously like that is

34:02.880 --> 34:10.640
really not the objective of most businesses so but if that is your objectives then i think

34:12.000 --> 34:18.240
that would be the form to pick i agree with you i don't think it's the answer to everything at

34:18.240 --> 34:26.240
all i mean it's not a panacea it's not a silver bullet or anything but it is very suitable to

34:27.200 --> 34:34.640
uh like picking up on the historical narrative of what they have responded to in the past

34:34.640 --> 34:42.320
so when you think about like one of the fastest growing uh largest areas of the economy that

34:42.320 --> 34:50.560
is really failing that is care right elder care so uh you have we have in all countries all over

34:50.560 --> 35:01.040
the world and like a explosive growth of people over 80 80 and older and uh there's a significant

35:01.040 --> 35:08.880
i mean millions of workers missing to fill those spots to care for them and uh that is also true

35:08.880 --> 35:17.360
in germany and uh yeah it's also i think hundreds of thousands of workers missing in that industry

35:17.360 --> 35:28.560
and the reason is that it's a low prestige and terribly paid job right and so with platform

35:28.560 --> 35:33.520
cooperatives organizing this cooperatively and we see some examples of this actually

35:34.240 --> 35:43.920
in in california in los angeles where platform co-op started by a union by the way has

35:44.400 --> 35:49.680
um started to work with two hospitals and they have been doing this for a very long time they

35:49.680 --> 35:57.680
had a pilot in 2016 or so like with 10 nurses and now they are working on scaling this up to

35:57.680 --> 36:05.200
2000 and then the hope is within two years to 10 000 nurses and to essentially offer

36:06.160 --> 36:15.680
uh care work flexibly through an app while paying the nurses

36:17.440 --> 36:19.440
better than they would have been paid otherwise

36:22.240 --> 36:27.680
so so i think it's a care and care sector is one example where i think this is very much

36:28.000 --> 36:34.960
uh predestined to work very well and then also we see i mean you know it seems sort of

36:35.600 --> 36:42.800
counter-intuitive but i mean this model in new york is working right with this competitor to

36:42.800 --> 36:48.880
lift not so much to uber right so this is also interesting it's not so much in terms of scale

36:48.880 --> 36:53.120
also i mean it's tertiary right so it's like the third biggest player in new york

36:53.840 --> 37:03.760
um and has a chance at that you know um but otherwise definitely in uh for food course

37:03.760 --> 37:10.800
so we see that in berlin and i think also Vienna but all over the world i mean there were i think

37:11.440 --> 37:18.800
eight or so of those founded in Barcelona in the last year alone so um they uh you know they're

37:18.880 --> 37:23.200
really emerging quickly not that they all stay around right this was specific to the pandemic

37:23.200 --> 37:30.800
but uh but there is a large uh federation already it's called co-op cycle uh coming out of paris

37:30.800 --> 37:39.200
which uh has more than 60 uh uh cooperatives under its wing of couriers and provides them

37:39.200 --> 37:46.320
with digital infrastructure right so they offer them the software and in return they

37:46.960 --> 37:51.440
uh all abide to certain principles for example they are not allowed to use motorcycles

37:52.000 --> 38:01.440
it has to be bicycled for ecological reasons so um that's where i where you see this can really

38:01.440 --> 38:06.240
work but we see it emerging in all kinds of sectors so it's very hard to say actually because

38:06.240 --> 38:13.920
you know we see it with this my cool classroom which has language teachers organizing through

38:13.920 --> 38:18.960
platform cooperatives which is essentially language teachers all over the world

38:20.240 --> 38:27.360
and being members of that we see it for designers we see it for photographers with stuxy

38:29.280 --> 38:30.080
we are seeing it

38:32.480 --> 38:37.840
in many different sectors but i think a chaos care and

38:37.840 --> 38:46.080
and transport transportation i think probably uh will be the most likely ones to succeed

38:46.800 --> 38:53.200
yeah yeah and you know in some countries for example like in brazil um the one of the largest

38:53.200 --> 38:58.960
domains of the cooperative movement in brazil is actually hospitals and doctors and nurses

38:58.960 --> 39:06.560
and so i think this is really where that is together as well and what do we have to do if

39:06.640 --> 39:13.520
we want to use this principle this this this type of social organization so to speak platform

39:13.520 --> 39:22.720
cooperatives as something that that is the nucleus for going beyond itself because there is of course

39:22.720 --> 39:32.320
an inherent danger in in the in the way that it might also by being the go-to place in crisis

39:33.040 --> 39:39.280
kind of letting the state like from the hook which would be a problem as well because i mean

39:39.280 --> 39:47.680
this is an obvious danger so i would say we need to like work in tandem with other movements with

39:47.680 --> 39:55.680
other like ideas for alternative ways of doing economy doing social organization and all of that

39:55.760 --> 40:02.560
in order to to make platform cooperativism something that like really

40:03.280 --> 40:10.480
is a building block of a post-capitalist future maybe no i absolutely agree so i mean again like

40:10.480 --> 40:19.520
another really great question um the uh yeah i mean i think it's essential to work with other

40:19.520 --> 40:26.400
movements and political movements so i think you know unions are a great place to start

40:27.200 --> 40:33.040
and just to just in passing to mention like why that matters i mean for many reasons

40:34.320 --> 40:38.000
very interesting to look at that in the indian example but just to stay in new york where

40:38.800 --> 40:45.680
you know like when they started when eric foreman and his colleagues started drivers

40:45.680 --> 40:51.520
cooperative like one of the the main problems for a startup like that is that they don't have

40:51.520 --> 40:58.080
marketing funds right so you can run because so much is dependent on supply right like you also

40:58.080 --> 41:04.560
need drivers right that are available so if you aren't known right if people don't haven't heard

41:04.560 --> 41:12.080
about you that's a real problem so this is where the vc backed companies spend you know millions

41:12.080 --> 41:20.000
of dollars so they didn't have that money so but by working with the union which has contacts to

41:20.000 --> 41:27.600
hundreds of thousands of people right so they were able to reach out to lots of new yorkers that to

41:28.400 --> 41:34.240
tell them about this and well it helped when the new york times picked up on it as well so

41:34.400 --> 41:45.120
um uh that's uh i guess one one answer to that question and if you think about like models of

41:45.120 --> 41:54.720
political economy that go beyond this notion of platform cooperativism what are the frameworks

41:54.720 --> 42:01.680
that you that you think about because i mean they are i recently uh read a bit more about paracon

42:01.680 --> 42:05.920
participatory econ economics i will do an interview with robert and now tomorrow by the

42:05.920 --> 42:12.240
way and and they when they describe the processes of transformation they very much point towards

42:12.240 --> 42:18.960
cooperatives as a necessary and very much uh important fruitful building block of this

42:19.760 --> 42:24.000
like of course long-lasting phase of transformation of transition into

42:24.640 --> 42:29.840
other types of political economy so we already established that cooperatives

42:30.800 --> 42:35.840
essentially have to be an important element of that but how do you what do you think about if

42:35.840 --> 42:44.720
you think beyond that like because at some point cooperatives will have like over lift themselves

42:44.720 --> 42:50.320
no i completely agree with that comment as well but i wanted to say just let's go for a second

42:50.320 --> 42:55.120
back to the your previous question because i think there's more to be said about this so james

42:55.200 --> 43:02.480
mahoon has just published this book platform socialism where he picks up exactly at this point

43:03.520 --> 43:12.640
i think a very interesting and fruitful book but i think very much from a european perspective

43:14.640 --> 43:22.240
where the i mean what we saw basically in the united states and in poland and in hungary and

43:22.240 --> 43:29.520
in so many other countries is that people just realize that the i mean there's the reason that

43:29.520 --> 43:37.840
they lost trust in government right and that is in the united states when you imagine a worker

43:37.840 --> 43:48.240
having entered the labor market in 1978 perhaps all these promises right in 50 years nothing has

43:48.240 --> 43:54.640
changed for that worker right except that productivity increased significantly

43:54.640 --> 44:02.400
and wages stagnated since 1978 right so like if adjusted for inflation so

44:03.680 --> 44:10.480
i mean how can you blame anyone that they would be disengaged from fed from federal government

44:10.480 --> 44:17.680
right so now now i would not i mean it's just it's just a fact do i like that of course not

44:17.680 --> 44:23.280
right and do i think is that participatory democracy is a project that nobody should ever

44:23.280 --> 44:29.920
give up on and and electoral politics of course of course not right but then there's also the

44:29.920 --> 44:40.160
reality that those systems are just deeply broken right so you see this even with the current

44:40.160 --> 44:46.080
presidency to an extent right and so this is i think where municipalities become much more important

44:46.080 --> 44:52.640
right and because on that level you can it's limited what you can do which we saw in the case

44:52.640 --> 45:00.880
of barcelona but you can do something and and and can actually really support a model like that to

45:00.880 --> 45:09.600
an extent and and make changes to an extent right so so i want to be really careful about this

45:09.600 --> 45:14.320
because i think i agree with you completely and i don't want to say i fully want to support what

45:14.320 --> 45:19.440
you said about you know like not letting the government off the hook but they also have to

45:19.440 --> 45:25.440
acknowledge that not every country is germany right and like when i look at the united states

45:25.440 --> 45:35.440
i mean it's a deeply flawed system right to be polite and very very dysfunctional and

45:36.800 --> 45:41.120
and that's not theoretical so you can say like well but you know we should we should

45:41.120 --> 45:46.640
hope for this to change you know but then look at the real lives of people this is real people

45:46.640 --> 45:51.840
living real lives every day and they are getting all these promises you know from politicians

45:52.400 --> 45:59.200
and they just don't come through it's not felt in their lives and i think this has to change right

45:59.760 --> 46:09.280
and uh and they there's i think a significant feeling of a lack of voice right that you don't

46:09.280 --> 46:17.120
have a voice in society which also cooperatives are in response to because when you think about

46:17.120 --> 46:22.720
in the united states incarcerated people are returning from prison so you know returning

46:22.720 --> 46:30.320
citizens entering the workplace so they are excluded from federal elections right i don't

46:30.320 --> 46:33.440
know if you know this so like when you come out of prison in the u.s you cannot vote anymore

46:34.080 --> 46:40.640
and uh so well those are the only workplaces where they you know actually have a real voice

46:40.640 --> 46:50.480
like they are equal members and have a voice and i think that is um i mean i think ultimately it's

46:50.480 --> 47:00.400
about uh social democracy i think that's a social democracy where people really have a felt

47:00.400 --> 47:04.560
relationship to what's happening in the government really changing their lives

47:05.520 --> 47:11.840
and the government that also really represents the types of people that actually constitute the

47:11.840 --> 47:20.000
population right so that kind of uh stakeholder society right like where people really feel

47:21.120 --> 47:27.360
part of that uh well i had talked about the vision before you had asked before and i appointed to

47:28.080 --> 47:37.920
a vision of a sort of pluralistic uh commonwealth right so where cooperatives are part of a global

47:37.920 --> 47:49.120
network of businesses that can also change the sort of north south dynamic right this gap

47:49.920 --> 47:54.640
because which of course is a criticism of cooperatives today which is like even the

47:54.640 --> 48:01.600
largest cooperatives like mondragon are dependent on supply chains that are just as deeply

48:01.600 --> 48:10.400
exploitative as um as anyone else and if there would also be cooperatives in the global south

48:10.400 --> 48:16.720
that then produce for cooperatives in the global north right and you would establish this um this

48:16.720 --> 48:23.280
commonwealth you could change that you could even extend that vision to what some people have called

48:23.280 --> 48:29.760
like data colonialism right and to to push back against how which which i think affects people in

48:29.760 --> 48:34.960
the global south much more than people in the global north uh because the data collection is

48:34.960 --> 48:41.760
much more ruthless um to actually put people in the global south in charge of their own data

48:41.760 --> 48:47.520
through data trusts or things we had mentioned earlier and maybe push back on that in this way

48:47.520 --> 48:55.360
as well so i think that's a vision yeah i mean i'm i think paracorn is a great approach

48:56.400 --> 49:02.720
as well there are many right of the sort of post-work society and many others

49:03.840 --> 49:12.400
which i support but you know i think they are often so far away that and this is very important

49:12.400 --> 49:17.680
you know i'm not at all taking away from that but i think what's there is a lot of that you

49:17.680 --> 49:25.200
know there's a lot of these long-term visions uh what is there's very very few of uh these sort

49:25.200 --> 49:32.880
of next steps right and i think uh like a lot of academics like really discourage this right they

49:32.880 --> 49:38.800
say like wow this is just too pragmatic and you get stuck in this sort of presentism or whatever

49:38.800 --> 49:45.440
you want to call it and i really disagree with that and i think it's it's uh deeply disrespectful

49:45.440 --> 49:53.440
of the lives of people now of the workers now that are living in these super precarious situations

49:53.440 --> 49:59.600
so i think to build something as you said a nucleus of like a scaffolding right a scaffolding on

49:59.600 --> 50:06.640
which you can then erect uh like a post-capitalist vision or let's say like a social democracy just

50:06.640 --> 50:16.720
on the way to that is is deeply valuable and and something i really support

50:18.160 --> 50:23.840
and there's one question i ask all of my guests at the end and this is if you think about the

50:23.840 --> 50:34.400
future what makes you joyful well i mean maybe i can talk to you about a class i taught which

50:34.400 --> 50:47.840
sounds um may be expected but um in 2020 in february uh mondragon the largest workup

50:47.840 --> 50:50.880
worker corp in the world right so they came to visit me at the university

50:51.680 --> 50:57.440
and shortly thereafter the pandemic started and we immediately uh you know we signed a paper to

50:57.440 --> 51:04.640
collaborate and um and we started a class an online class on platform co-ops like an emergency

51:04.640 --> 51:14.960
response and we taught over 1200 students from 57 countries and uh and managed because there was

51:14.960 --> 51:24.000
a sense of urgency to engage uh over 50 organizing over 60 organizations actually in those countries

51:24.000 --> 51:30.560
so they supported the course locally helping people with their local knowledge about the laws

51:30.560 --> 51:40.640
and language etc to start those those uh projects and we had weekly meetings uh everybody in their

51:40.640 --> 51:48.240
lockdown and in a time which was really rather dark and possibly depressing uh and for me this

51:48.240 --> 51:55.840
was just i mean it was an incredible experience because you saw all these people you know like

51:55.840 --> 52:03.200
from i don't know transgender entrepreneurs in malaysia connecting with like african-american

52:03.200 --> 52:12.640
entrepreneurs in selma alabama i mean like who i mean just to see these like in front of you like

52:12.640 --> 52:20.480
all these people all over the world right having this wonderful spirit and all dedicating themselves

52:20.480 --> 52:27.840
to changing their world uh i mean i guess if anything could give you hope i mean that was

52:27.840 --> 52:39.120
definitely a moment um to and it really uh sowed the seeds for further work right because now these

52:39.120 --> 52:47.760
organizations uh learned about platform co-ops and they are now incubating them right also after

52:47.760 --> 52:54.160
a couple classes over and uh and we still hear from projects coming out of that

52:55.120 --> 52:59.360
um and so on so it's a very it's a very beautiful experience

53:00.720 --> 53:07.280
