00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and my guest today is Daniel E. Sarrows,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,080
with whom I will be talking about digital socialism and the abolition of capital.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,560
Before we get to the interview, I'd like to say a few words on this.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,640
What you are about to hear is an in-depth discussion of Daniel Sarrows' proposal of

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,800
a socialist political economy with its own socialist laws of motion and a socialist mode

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,680
of production. More than anything, this is an invitation to everybody out there longing for

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,400
fundamentally different political economies to please join the discussion. And if I say everybody,

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,680
I do mean everybody and specifically people coming from other traditions of thought and

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,760
political orientation. I'm really honestly interested in your opinion on that. This whole

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,880
thing here is meant to be an open and honest investigation of how fundamentally different

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,720
kinds of futures can be brought about. And I do believe that Dan's work is an important

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,880
contribution to this. Since he dares to do what many shy away from, he puts out a concrete

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,200
proposal. Such a proposal can only be seen as a starting point, of course, and I can't stress

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,000
this enough. This is a wholehearted invitation to engage with these ideas. I put an extra effort

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
in creating the show notes for this episode, so you'll find a lot of resources for further

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,920
engagement with the topic there. We will cover the proposal as well as its historical foundations

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,960
in great detail, so much so that I had to split the three-hour interview into two episodes.

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,960
The second part will be released in episode 32 of Future Histories in two weeks time.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Patreon supporters, however, can listen to it already starting today. So if you are super

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,440
fixed by what you hear today and can't stand waiting another two weeks, every support on

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Patreon is greatly appreciated. But now please enjoy today's episode with Daniel Seros on

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,200
digital socialism and the abolition of capital.

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,840
Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and my guest today is Daniel E. Seros. Daniel is

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,000
a professor of economics at Valparaiso University and author of the book Information Technology

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,760
and Socialist Construction, The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism, which we will

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,320
discuss at length in today's episode. Welcome, Daniel. Thank you. It's great to be here. Great

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,000
to have you. First of all, thank you, Daniel, not only for taking the time for this interview, but

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,840
also for writing this book. I think it's really of vital importance that we develop very concrete

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,160
proposals for alternative political economies, yet many shy away from exactly that and end up in

30
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,240
vague appeals to solidarity that might be more immune to criticism, but at the same time,

31
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,240
they do not provide answers to the crucial question of how exactly an alternative to

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,920
the capitalist mode of production should be organized. So I was delighted to read your

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
very concrete proposal, which addresses basic questions of political economy and its mode of

34
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,920
production head on. What is it that you aimed for with your book? Well, ever since I was a graduate

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,480
student at the University of Notre Dame, I've been studying Marxian economics. And around 2008,

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,560
it became clear to me that I could not continue working in this tradition unless I answered the

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,640
question for myself, just how the socialist mode of production would operate. So it's really not

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,040
enough to criticize capitalism. One must have something concrete to offer in its place.

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,760
And so I began working on that question. And it became clear to me that a socialist society

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,480
would need to find an alternative movement that could replace the movement of capital,

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,800
as Marx described it in volume one of capital. So it would need to have its own logic, its own

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,440
dynamic that would be self-sustaining and allow for the continued development of

43
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,000
society's productive forces. So most importantly, it would need to eliminate the exploitation of

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,840
labor power, which is the defining feature of the capitalist mode of production.

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
So I think we need an entirely new method of economic organization.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,480
We don't want to simply focus on interventions within the capitalist system, such as minimum wage

47
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,600
laws and Keynesian macroeconomic management. As much as those kinds of interventions might be

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,280
important in a capitalist society to achieve equity, economic stabilization, what we need

49
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,360
is a full-blown alternative that can really stand on its own. And even though it will emerge from

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,720
capitalist society, it's going to be something entirely different. And in order to build a

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,360
sketch of how this could look like, your book has four parts. First, the logic of capital,

52
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,600
second, the defense of capital, third, the renewed challenge to capital and fourth,

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,080
the end of capital. These are all very much relevant for the investigations of this podcast.

54
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,880
So please let's take a look at each of them. In part one, you first describe the capitalist

55
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,280
laws of motion. You then argue that while Marx did indeed provide an analysis of the capitalist

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,240
mode of production, he did not provide a concrete answer or idea of what socialism would actually

57
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,080
look like and how it would be organized in practical terms. First things first, what is

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,200
the logic of capital and what does it mean to abolish capital as such?

59
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,840
Well, I think to understand the logic of capital, you really need to read volume one of Marx's

60
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,160
capital. There's no substitute for it. It's very difficult to read the first time, especially part

61
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,600
one on commodities and money, but it's worth the effort. And so capital obeys certain rules or laws

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,160
of motion. And that is what I mean when I refer to its logic. So Marx describes how commodity

63
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,640
exchange within capitalist economies can be represented symbolically as CMC prime.

64
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,840
So that is commodities are sold for money and then they're used to purchase other commodities.

65
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,040
This is the sphere of circulation where Adam Smith's invisible hand operates.

66
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,880
People pursue their own self-interest and they exchange their property for the property of

67
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,160
another person. And then that leaves both sides to the exchange better off than previously.

68
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,400
At the same time, Marx identified another movement that can be easily overlooked.

69
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:18,880
And this movement is capital and is symbolically represented as MCM prime. So in that case,

70
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,240
money is used to buy commodities and then the commodities are sold for a larger sum of money.

71
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,920
And the difference is surplus value, the difference between the amount of money initially

72
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,600
spent and the amount that's realized at the end. That difference is surplus value.

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,600
So it's realization and appropriation or what motivates capitalists to set capital in motion.

74
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,240
So how is this surplus value possible? Well, Marx argued that there is a special commodity

75
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,480
that's available in the marketplace in capitalist societies. And this is the commodity labor power,

76
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,120
which is the capacity to work during a specific period of time. So it's sold as a commodity

77
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,800
in the marketplace. And it has this special property that when it's consumed, it actually

78
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,280
creates new value since human labor is the source of value. So the really amazing feature of this

79
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,960
commodity labor power is that its value depends on the values of the commodities that the worker

80
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,920
needs to live and work. But its value creating power is actually larger. So during the course

81
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,480
of a working day, a worker will create new value equivalent to what they need to live and work.

82
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,160
But then because they work during the entire working day, they create value in excess of that.

83
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,360
And that surplus value is what motivates capitalists to pursue capitalist production.

84
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,400
So the basic movement that I just described has been this driving force throughout the history of

85
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,040
global capitalism. And this accumulation of capital has really revolutionized the means

86
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,400
of production and created this world that we have today. So to come back to your question,

87
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,640
what does it mean to abolish capital? It means to bring an end to this economic category,

88
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,120
as Marx defined it. And so we want to identify an alternative movement that can positively

89
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,240
develop society's productive forces and better serve human needs. So it is possible, of course,

90
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,240
to abolish capital and destroy human civilization. But that's obviously not what most of us want.

91
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,520
And so what we want is a positive substitute for this thing that Marx called capital.

92
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:45,600
Well, you're right that it is important for us to, and I quote here, recognize the crucial point

93
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,840
that even if everyone on the planet adopted Marxism, socialism would not be possible unless

94
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,600
certain objective conditions were met. What these conditions are is the key question that

95
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,480
must be answered. And on this question, Marx and Engels had precious little to say. According to

96
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,560
your book, there is a silence both about these objective conditions for socialism as well as on

97
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,960
the question of how a socialist political economy would be organized in practical terms. You call

98
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:25,040
this the great silence. Could you maybe explain this a bit to us? Sure. I argue in the book that

99
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,320
there are really two essential conditions that must be met for socialism to be possible.

100
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,720
So the first is what I'm referring to as the acquisition of social consciousness

101
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,080
throughout the human population. So this means that we need to become conscious of the fact that

102
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,920
we are members of the human species and that we work together to achieve some sort of balance

103
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,280
between our productive activities and the natural environment. And furthermore, we must recognize

104
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,920
capitalism involves a conflict between social classes and that will never achieve this balance

105
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,880
as long as this conflict continues. So one condition then is that we become conscious

106
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,880
of these things. The problem, however, is that even if we all become committed Marxists and

107
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,920
acquired this species consciousness, it would still not be sufficient to alter the mode of

108
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,880
production, I argue, because certain objective conditions must also be met. So specifically,

109
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,480
our productive forces must be sufficient to produce an abundance of use values for consumption.

110
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,800
That is a condition that socialists, I think, have long recognized that we'd be able to produce a

111
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:41,120
huge abundance of use values of material wealth. Without this ability, we would enter into conflict

112
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,400
with one another over what is available. We would also not produce enough beyond what's needed to

113
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,840
satisfy our basic needs to then further develop the social forces of production. So in other words,

114
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,680
it wouldn't be anything left for investment. So more is needed then. And what we also need is to

115
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,640
be able to communicate our needs to each other in a way that is conscious and planned and then use

116
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,360
that information to efficiently allocate resources to produce what we need. So socialists have long

117
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,640
argued that the ability to produce an abundance of use values is a key requirement for socialism

118
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,600
to be established. But again, this emphasis on the communication of social needs has been given

119
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,760
less attention, I think. So I argue that Marx and Engels did not specify these conditions clearly,

120
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,440
and they argued instead that speculation about the socialist future was a utopian exercise.

121
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,200
They had really very little to say about the subject of socialism, especially in comparison

122
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,480
with how much they wrote about capitalism. And I think this silence on the question,

123
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,080
it appears as a contradiction in Marx's worldview. And this is something I bring up in the introduction

124
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,480
to the book. That is, the proletariat is supposed to consciously establish socialism,

125
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,960
and yet we cannot describe what socialism is in any detail. And there seems to be a conflict there.

126
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:20,720
So really, the whole book, I would say, is about trying to resolve this apparent contradiction.

127
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,880
How could Marx hold both views simultaneously that we're supposed to consciously bring about

128
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,840
socialism, but at the same time, we should not describe how it is to function in any detail?

129
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,000
That seems contradictory. So really, to resolve this contradiction,

130
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,320
I think what we need to do is recognize that Marx's vision was limited due to the insufficient

131
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,240
development of society's productive forces or its technological capability. In other words,

132
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,440
modern information technology was not available or even conceivable in Marx's time. And so I argue

133
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,480
that this modern information technology is one of the essential objective conditions that must be

134
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,640
in place for the socialist mode of production to be possible. So whereas it was once utopian

135
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,960
to describe how socialism would function, it's really no longer utopian because we possess the

136
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,040
means now to make it a reality. So I think Marx was really honest in that he didn't offer a false

137
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,360
solution, but only identified the features of what he called the lower and higher phases of communism

138
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,520
that could be only perfectly described at that moment in history. So this seems to me to be the

139
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,040
only way to really resolve this apparent contradiction in Marx's thought unless we just

140
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,840
accept the view that there is no alternative to capitalism and that Marx was simply wrong in what

141
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:58,480
he wrote. And isn't it a classical retreat to say, oh well, no, he didn't specify it in that much

142
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,480
detail because this would have been a kind of, I don't know, paternalistic act where you have

143
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,040
this blueprint of the future and that instead it should kind of organically evolve out of the

144
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,800
movement itself and that anything else would be some kind of authoritarian act somehow?

145
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,440
I think that's a good point. And one could maybe argue that that's another way to resolve the

146
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:34,720
paradox, that Marx didn't want to establish the blueprint and as you put it, in a paternalistic

147
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,640
manner, tell the working class what it should be doing. You certainly can take that position.

148
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:51,760
But it seems to me that that leaves the questions just so open-ended and with so much disagreement

149
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,640
about what to do. It's hard to imagine the working class ever, and maybe that's part of the problem

150
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:07,920
is that there needs to be unity among the workers as they pursue this. If there's such widespread

151
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,440
disagreement within the working class, how could they ever transform the mode of production

152
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,960
completely? So I think that may be a potential problem with that way of resolving the paradox.

153
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,440
One certainly could try to do it that way. I totally agree with you, actually, because

154
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:37,680
I also believe that it is necessary to have this imaginary of a different kind of future.

155
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,720
And also, I think the point is quite valid that this imaginary future should not be

156
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:54,640
utopian in essence, in the sense that the basis for its realization is actually not

157
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:02,320
existent. So I like your point or your twist that you're saying, all right, we need this image

158
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:10,480
and we do have the means of production now to make it possible. That's kind of the punchline

159
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,920
that I got from your book and I really enjoyed it, actually. Thank you. Okay, so now let's get

160
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:25,600
to the juicy stuff. Let's get to the socialist calculation debate. You have a long chapter

161
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,960
on this topic and I very much enjoyed this chapter as well. Throughout the first half of the 20th

162
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,400
century, there has been quite an argument about the question of whether or not an autonomous

163
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,120
socialist mode of economic calculation is possible or not. This has been labeled the

164
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,840
socialist calculation debate. What were, from your perspective, the key arguments within the debate?

165
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,880
Who were the participants and what can we learn from it? Well, this debate took place primarily

166
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,400
between market socialists like Oskar Lange and H. D. Dickinson and Austrian economists such as Ludwig

167
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,440
von Mises and F. A. Hayek. I give much credit to Mises in the book for arguing that socialists

168
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,600
lack a method of economic calculation. In his view, without competitive markets, it would not

169
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,920
be possible to have a rational economic system. That is, without market prices, we are left

170
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,280
fumbling around in the dark without a rational guide for our decision-making processes.

171
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,280
This point was very important and I believe it is what Hayek referred to as the unseen problem

172
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,800
facing socialist alternatives. This fumbling in the dark, of course, opens the door to the use

173
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,640
of coercion or a command system which many socialists rejected at the time and even more

174
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,880
reject the use of command now. Mises thought it was logically impossible to solve the problem

175
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,720
any other way than through voluntary exchange. Hayek found it to be logically possible to solve

176
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,920
the problem, but the information processing requirements were so massive that it could not

177
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,400
be solved in a practical sense. It was also not possible to even acquire as much information as

178
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,440
would be needed in his view. Market socialists, on the other hand, wanted to have some form of

179
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,760
socially owned property while relying on the competitive market to allocate resources.

180
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,960
So some economists argued that the problem of market socialism could be resolved in a variety

181
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,160
of ways. One of the early papers by Enrico Barone described a trial and error method of solving the

182
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,920
problem so we could adjust prices. A central authority could adjust prices in the face of

183
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,400
surpluses and shortages and in that way commodity markets could be cleared. The same method could

184
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,440
be used to clear the money capital market. Hayek rejected this solution on the grounds that

185
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,640
competition could lead to more rapid price adjustments than a central planner could achieve.

186
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,920
H.D. Dickinson argued that an elite planning body could estimate supply and demand equations

187
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,120
and then solve a system of simultaneous equations to determine the optimal market clearing prices.

188
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,880
So I want to make a couple points here. That's kind of an overview of the debate as I understand

189
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,960
it. But first I want to say that I interpret the socialist calculation debate as stemming from the

190
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,400
same problem that Marx and Engels encountered and thus why they did not say more about the socialist

191
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,760
future. So that is Marx and Engels hesitated to describe the future socialist society because they

192
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,680
lacked the means to do so and only modern information technology allows for this socialist

193
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:54,720
calculation problem to be solved. So the debate, I argue, stemmed from the combination of Marx's

194
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,880
superior theory of capitalism but his inability due to historical constraints to describe how

195
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,800
the problem would be solved. So it's understandable then that there would have been such a lengthy

196
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,840
debate in the early 20th century about how to resolve this problem. And second, if socialists

197
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,880
have adopted Marx's theory of capital, why are they striving to achieve the ideals of perfect

198
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,200
competition as neoclassical economists define them? If neoclassical economists possess a flawed theory

199
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,200
of how capitalism functions by, for example, omitting class exploitation, then why would you

200
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,720
strive to achieve their efficiency results? Schubert, for example, was very critical of

201
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,800
market socialists for choosing this path and I agree that this is kind of an odd way to try

202
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,480
to solve the problem. Why would you build on a theory you disagree with in an effort to resolve

203
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,880
a problem with your own theory? I'd actually make a really bold claim and that listeners might

204
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,760
not agree with. But I would argue that both sides in that debate were interested in it because both

205
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,200
actually wanted to know if a solution exists. Market socialists favored Marx's theory and they

206
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,160
were eager to put forward a solution. Austrian economists, I would argue, also they recognized

207
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,160
the problem and they were interested in whether there was a solution but they were skeptical that

208
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,440
a solution would be found. And so even though I think Austrian economists recognized the strength

209
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,800
of Marx's theory but they didn't want to publicly acknowledge it, which would certainly be a

210
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,840
controversial claim for some, I include some references to Hayek's statements in my book

211
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,840
where it suggests that he at some point tried to kind of pull back from some of those views

212
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,720
because he didn't feel there was a resolution to these problems. So I think mainly that's what

213
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,160
I think we can learn from it. And just out of curiosity, I really liked it that at some point

214
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,560
in your book you point towards the need to look at the base of the argument and as you already

215
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,280
explained right now, you think that Marx did a proper analysis of the capitalist mode of production

216
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,400
but did not provide an alternative to the question of economic calculation and then Hayek,

217
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,200
on the other side, cleverly uses this omission as the base layer of his argument while at the same

218
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,120
time not providing a proper alternative analysis of the capitalist mode of production. But this

219
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,720
still leaves open the question if there has been an attempt to fill Hayek's omission and develop

220
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,800
an Austrian analysis of the capitalist mode of production. I don't know if anybody did this,

221
00:23:50,800 --> 00:24:00,160
maybe Rothbard or anything, because if you say that they saw what Marx did right and they had

222
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,120
a valid point in the question of economic calculation, then they must have had the

223
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:14,560
urge to make it complete, to come up with their own idea of how to interpret the capitalist mode

224
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:21,920
of production. Yes, and I think the roots of Austrian economics go back to the late 19th

225
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,680
century, the work of Karl Menger, and they do possess a theory of capitalism. But I would

226
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,600
argue it's inferior to Marx's theory because like neoclassical economics, it avoids class conflict

227
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,800
and so it really has less to work with in its analysis of capitalism and that's really at the

228
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:46,400
root of its inferior nature relative to Marx's theory. However, it has much to say about

229
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,440
monopolistic firms and their behavior, capital theory, the theory of the business cycle.

230
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,440
My textbook actually, which is available online for free, includes quite a bit of this material.

231
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,680
It's available at principlesofpoliticaleconomy.pressbooks.com for anyone who's interested

232
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,760
in looking at it. So Roger Garrison, actually an Austrian economist, gave me permission to

233
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,200
summarize in my textbook his diagrammatic representation of Austrian macroeconomic theory

234
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,720
and I also include Rothbard's discussion of an Austrian measurement of the money supply.

235
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,840
So even though I ultimately favor Marx's theory, I do respect

236
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,800
theories that have been developed within other schools of thought, including the Austrian school.

237
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,360
That's nice because I think it had some... When I was reading your book,

238
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,760
I had the sense of intellectual honesty somehow. So I think it's important to engage

239
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,480
in the arguments of the different fashions. I don't want to say the other side because

240
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,840
that would be too dualistic, but I very much enjoyed that you obviously take this serious,

241
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,440
the argument of the Austrians. And there would be a second question relating to that.

242
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,480
And that is actually going into the other direction, not in the direction of how to

243
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:17,040
complete the theory by providing an autonomous interpretation of the capitalist mode of

244
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,200
production. But if Hayek... Because I was then looking at Wikipedia, when did he die?

245
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:33,440
He died in 1992. So he must have experienced the advent of computer technology. And if it was,

246
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:41,200
as you said, that he at some point kind of opened this loophole that there might be a way to

247
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,560
provide a different type of economic calculation, but that it is just not discovered yet, then he

248
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,880
actually must have considered computers and information technology at some point. Did he

249
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,480
write about it or are there some public statements about this? Yeah, you've asked an interesting

250
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,080
question here. And I have to confess. I mean, the truth is, I don't know for sure. I'm really not

251
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,040
an expert on all of Hayek's work. My interest was in the factors that influenced the debate in the

252
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:17,680
1920s and the 1930s. And I do regard it as an error to think that computer solving systems of

253
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,040
demand and supply equations could bring about socialism. The kind of solution that I propose

254
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,240
really relies on information technology, but in a very different way. And I don't think that this

255
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:36,000
use of computer technology could have been imagined in the early 1990s, much less in the 1930s.

256
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,040
So my suspicion is that Hayek would have thought that the problem of acquiring

257
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,560
so much information and processing it would still remain, even with the kind of computer

258
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:58,160
technology we have in the 21st century. But, and I guess here's coming back to my punchline,

259
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:09,360
I think that the kind of system that I have proposed is not one that any of the contributors

260
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,840
to this debate had in mind at all. It's completely different from what they were

261
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,040
talking about or even how they were imagining how computers might be used in the future.

262
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,200
So I think that's probably what sets my proposal apart. And yeah, but as far as whether Hayek

263
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,400
actually commented on that question, I really don't know. When it comes to popular positions

264
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,920
that defend capitalism, you pick them. For me, curious candidate, Iain Rand,

265
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,720
you picked her as your sparring partner. This came somewhat of a surprise to me because I knew

266
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,480
about her influence on the early Silicon Valley elite. And I have seen a documentary by Adam

267
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,720
Curtis, where her philosophy is explained as well as her influence on, for example, Alan Greenspan,

268
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,560
the former head of the Federal Reserve. Yet I always thought of her more as a pop cultural

269
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,960
phenomenon or even a sectarian, actually, to be honest, than a serious thinker. Could you

270
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,240
introduce our listeners to her philosophy and maybe explain a bit why you picked her in order

271
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,440
to make your point? That is a great question. The truth is that Rand actually challenged me the most

272
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,120
of any of the pro market writers that I've encountered. I was not very familiar with

273
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Rand's work when I started this project. And I discovered that she defended capitalism in a way

274
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,920
that sharply deviated from the free market economists that I had been reading for years.

275
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,120
Rand's theory is a moral theory of capitalism. And to use morality as a starting point for

276
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,320
thinking about capitalism was completely new to me. Rand thought of herself as someone who

277
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,160
celebrates what humans are. And in her view, they are creative and capable of extraordinary feats.

278
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,960
And because of the nature of human beings, they possess rights, in her view. Specifically,

279
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,680
the individual possesses a right to life and to property. And only if these rights are protected

280
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:24,000
will an individual be able to realize who he or she is and unleash his or her creative potential.

281
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,440
So when governments interfere with these rights, these rights derive from nature. And so governments

282
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,200
then act immorally when they interfere with them. Since capitalism protects these rights,

283
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,240
it's a moral system, in her view. So this whole way of thinking was really new to me.

284
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,520
And I knew that I would need to settle for myself. What if anything was wrong with her world view?

285
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,040
Also, my book is ultimately about what humanity should do at this point in history.

286
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,520
And Marx and Rand both speak directly to that extremely broad question in a way that is openly

287
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,240
political. And so I wanted to take on a position that did not try to conceal its normative biases

288
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,440
while posing as objective and neutral. And this fight sort of seemed like an open and honest fight

289
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:21,120
between thinkers. So that's mainly why I chose to devote so much attention to her view in my book.

290
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:31,520
We've touched upon the subject of market socialism before. But since it is still a

291
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,720
very popular position within the socialist movement, I'd like to hear your general take

292
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,760
on why many still favor market socialism today. And I'm also interested in a specific question

293
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,280
related to that. Because in your book, you write about the historical socialist calculation debate,

294
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,600
and I quote here, in fact, in my opinion, the Austrians forced the debate and they received a

295
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:03,440
neoclassical answer, end quote. And you already talked about this. What I'm asking myself then is,

296
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,680
does this hold true for today's market socialists as well? Do they provide a neoclassical answer

297
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:17,520
as well? Or did they come up with a different rationale? Market socialism seems to possess the

298
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,000
best of both worlds. And I think that's a major part of the reason why so many still favor market

299
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,480
socialism. It offers freedom of choice of consumer goods and of occupation. It promotes efficiency

300
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,560
through competition. At the same time, it eliminates private ownership of the means of production. And

301
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,120
so it's aimed at eliminating the capitalist exploitation of labor power. So in addition,

302
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,800
it can also involve Keynesian demand management to lessen business cycles.

303
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:54,480
It can offer corrective taxes and subsidies to address externalities in markets. It will ensure

304
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,640
sufficient attention to the production of public goods. So it's a mix of characteristics that is

305
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,840
supposed to retain what we like about capitalism while eliminating the rest of it, the things we

306
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,200
don't like or that many of us don't like. It appears to many socialists to be the only answer

307
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,920
that really avoids command central planning on the one hand or capitalism on the other hand.

308
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,000
And so it's like a third way between the two extremes. So I think that's the main reason why

309
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:34,800
it's been so popular. But in terms of whether market socialists have their views evolved or

310
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,800
changed, I think the rationale for it is still pretty much the same since the socialist calculation

311
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,960
debate, except that maybe less emphasis is placed now in the neoclassical efficiency results.

312
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Now I think emphasis is placed more on issues like equality and solidarity and democracy as

313
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,120
outcomes that are also achieved in addition to efficiency. But to the best of my knowledge,

314
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,400
I don't think the basic position has changed all that much.

315
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,680
And what are, from your position, the shortcomings of market socialism? What are the strongest

316
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:18,880
arguments against it then? I think market socialism might be able to achieve self-management

317
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,040
within enterprises, although there's no guarantee of that. It has a chance of achieving that,

318
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,680
as well as direct appropriation of profit by the workers within an enterprise.

319
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,040
I think that's probably its greatest strength. But the problem is that it does not eliminate

320
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,000
profit as an economic category, which is a shortcoming. So it really does not abolish

321
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,200
capital as an economic category. So therefore, competition between enterprises will continue,

322
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,240
along with the macroeconomic instability that is experienced within capitalist societies.

323
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,360
Needs will continue to go unmet in the system because profit is really the basic objective

324
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,720
of enterprises still and not the fulfillment of needs. And finally, as the Hungarian economist

325
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,440
Janos Kornia explained, it's likely to slip towards either market capitalism or towards

326
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,200
command central planning. Failure to replace capital with an alternative sort of self-sustaining

327
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,640
dynamic is going to cause its strength to grow to the point where market capitalism is revived

328
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
or coercion will be needed to stop its resurgence.

329
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
All right. And that's why you had to come up with a different solution, actually. So

330
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,360
let's get to the end of capital. First of all, let's talk about the socialist laws of motion

331
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,200
that you propose. I think what has become clear by now is that you argue for the abolition of

332
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,960
capital as such and that if we abolish the capitalist mode of production, we of course

333
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,800
need to propose a different mode of production with different laws of motion. In your case,

334
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,040
these would be socialist laws of motion in a first socialist mode of production and later on,

335
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,440
a communist mode of production. Let's do this step by step. First of all,

336
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,120
what does it mean to have socialist laws of motion in place? What are their characteristics

337
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:20,560
and their logic? By socialist laws of motion, I mean a self-sustaining mechanism that allows

338
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,600
individuals within a complex organic economy to pursue the fulfillment of needs while it also

339
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,880
guarantees them compensation for their useful labor. So if I were to summarize it in one

340
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,480
sentence, that's how I would put it. There's obviously a lot more to it, but it will provide

341
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,240
people with a set of rules and specific forms of interaction that will allow them to cooperatively

342
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,640
work towards needs fulfillment without the social relationships becoming exploitative.

343
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,920
So this mechanism has to be elaborated and understood before it is introduced. We can't

344
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,520
really discover its inner workings after it is brought into existence the way that we must do

345
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,160
with capitalism. The reason again is that the socialist mode of production must be a conscious

346
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,840
creation if it ever exists. It's not going to emerge on its own without anyone's conscious

347
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:22,560
direction. It's something we have to create. So we need to understand what this social mechanism

348
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,920
is before we actually live in such a society. That's what I argue.

349
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,840
And what is it that you propose? What are the general properties that a socialist mode of

350
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,000
production should have? I argue that the socialist mode of production must place the

351
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,880
self-conscious individual human being at the center. So the individual recognizes the importance of

352
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,200
communicating his or her needs to others and responding to the needs of others when making

353
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,280
decisions about production. It's a society without the capitalist exploitation of labor power.

354
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,760
Labor power does not exist as a commodity, and since markets give rise to labor power as a

355
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:15,040
commodity, markets do not exist. So the wealth of society does not consist of commodities,

356
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,200
as Marx described capitalist society in volume one of Capital, because commodities are unities

357
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,360
of use value and exchange value. They're both useful things, but they also have a value in the

358
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,800
marketplace. And since there are no markets, then things are not going to be exchange values. They

359
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,560
won't be considered commodities. So every product and service consumed then would only be a use

360
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,520
value. And so the trick is in trying to explain how society can use modern forces of production,

361
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,680
how society can use modern forces of production, including our very extensive division of labor

362
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,600
to produce use values that do not become commodities. So again, I need to make that

363
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,160
more concrete, which I hope to do later in this interview, but that's essentially it.

364
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,600
Yeah, great. I hope so too that we will get to the concrete propositions and we will for sure.

365
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,280
At some point in your book, you quote a neoclassical economists economics textbook by

366
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,360
Samuelson and Nordhaus, which says that, and I quote here, every society must have a way of

367
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,440
determining what commodities are produced, how these goods are made and for whom they are produced.

368
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,840
And that these are the quote, three fundamental questions of economic organization. So here we

369
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,520
have our concreteness actually. I think that's fair enough as a basic practical standard,

370
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,960
or at least I think it absolutely makes sense to expect these questions to be answered in a

371
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:59,920
socialist economy as well. So let's use these three fundamentals, fundamental questions

372
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,240
in order to go through your proposal. The first one would be how do you determine what is being

373
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:14,080
produced? I'm really glad you asked this question because these are the questions that show up in

374
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,320
every neoclassical economics textbook, Samuelson and Nordhaus and every other one. All students

375
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:28,480
of economics are introduced to economics in this way. How can we organize the economy to address

376
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,480
these questions and what are the different ways of organizing an economy to address these questions?

377
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,360
So it's going to be difficult for me to explain the mechanism completely without the use of tables,

378
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,200
but I'll do my best. I refer listeners to a paper on my selected works page that has

379
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,240
the details. It goes into a lot of depth about how this would work. But within the socialist

380
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,440
mode of production, workers councils would post use values in a general catalog or a universal

381
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,520
catalog of use values. And then consumers would select these use values and place them in something

382
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,040
called a needs profile to which they have electronic access. These use values would be

383
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,080
arranged in order from most desired to least desired and given rankings in descending order

384
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,000
as you move down the profile. You can leave empty spaces in the profile that will help one to kind

385
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,360
of rank some needs much more than others. Every person's need is ranked the same as every other

386
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,000
person's need. And this information is used to determine how much of each type of use value

387
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,760
a workers council will produce. And so this really answers the question of what to produce.

388
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,280
Information is collected from consumers as they register needs in their needs profiles.

389
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,200
It'll determine what's produced and the quantities produced. Then how to produce is really the next

390
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,080
question. And the point rankings that are assigned to the use values in the needs profiles are going

391
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,880
to be communicated to the workers councils that posted the use values. So each workers council

392
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,560
will develop its own target mix of inputs that it needs for production and the points would be used

393
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:14,000
to cooperatively allocate inputs from workers councils that supply inputs. The points then

394
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,480
can be used to allocate inputs according to where the need is greatest. So this method of allocating

395
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,160
scarce inputs provides the answer, I think, to the Austrian critique that socialists lack a method

396
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,120
of economic calculation. Once the inputs are received, it's also necessary to adjust membership

397
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:39,040
in the workers council to acquire the amount of labor power needed. I have a mechanism for doing

398
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,360
this that involves adjustments in the length of the working period, given income that's based on

399
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,240
experience and effort. So at least this gives you kind of a general overview of how I answer the

400
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,040
question of how to produce these use values. And then a special workers council will also be

401
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,960
established that sets resource consumption limits in each region, which ensures environmental

402
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,440
sustainability. I refer to this as a council of scientists. It has a very special role in the

403
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:19,440
system because natural resources are available in such huge quantities that when this process of

404
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,920
allocating resources reaches the natural resource base, we need to have some limits on that, some

405
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,960
global limits on how much we're using so that we can meet our environmental goals, which are becoming

406
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,360
more pressing all the time. So finally then, for whom are the use values produced? Well, workers

407
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,200
are paid with credits for their work. And when consumers purchase use values for which they

408
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,720
registered in need, they also receive a bonus in my proposal, which becomes part of their income.

409
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,560
And that's also in the form of credits. So the use values are primarily going to be produced with

410
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,320
those people in mind who registered in need. Others can purchase the use values using credits,

411
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,760
even if they did not register in need, but that action would negatively affect their bonus.

412
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,760
So again, I go into a lot of detail in my online paper and in the book about how all this works,

413
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:25,440
but those are the concrete details of the system. Okay. So I guess I will have to play the role of

414
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,560
a Advocatus Diabuli a bit, because if you put out a proposal like this, some questions will come up,

415
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,600
for example, relating to the Council of Scientists that you mentioned.

416
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,360
I guess there are two concerns there. One would be the question of elitism, because they have a

417
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,840
powerful role within your proposal. They decide upon the ultimate amount of resources that can

418
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:00,640
be used for the economy in total, which is of course great because it is a way to deal with

419
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,280
questions of ecological collapse. So this is a plus actually, but still it's a very powerful

420
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:16,000
position and people do have different ideas towards this question. So I think this will be

421
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,480
a kind of a battleground, of course. And I think the second question that relates to the first one

422
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,640
as well is that maybe it's because of the name. It kind of suggests as if there was such a thing

423
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:39,600
as one objective truth or even one science, but that's of course not the case. There are

424
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:48,080
many different sciences. There are different approaches towards the same field of a specific

425
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,360
science. It doesn't mean that there are just many, many different fields for science, but

426
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:01,200
that there are different approaches towards what science actually is and that there is no such

427
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:08,720
thing as one objective truth. So I guess my question would be, is there, how do you deal

428
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:17,280
with this? Is there maybe a bit more, I don't know, more grayish approach and less black and

429
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,480
whitish approach to this question of a council of scientists? This is a great question and

430
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,400
I guess I want to emphasize that this council of scientists has a very limited role to play.

431
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,680
It's really only to identify the quantities of these resources in each region that can be

432
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:48,720
sustainably extracted and employed in production. The role pretty much ends there and certainly

433
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,600
I have not specified how the decisions within the council would be made.

434
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,760
One can certainly imagine trying to establish rules based on

435
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:12,000
consensus decision making or majority rule. I haven't come to any firm conclusions about that

436
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,520
on my own. Certainly these scientists would need to defend their positions. They would need to

437
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:27,840
produce reports defending their claim that we cannot exceed these resource consumption limits

438
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:35,360
and if we do, this is the likely impact. So there would be checks, there would be scrutiny,

439
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,160
and there wouldn't be much incentive for these scientists to misrepresent their views. There

440
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:50,240
may be disagreement about how far we can go, but I'm not quite sure how else we, the alternative

441
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,800
is to allow capital accumulation to continue, allow private owners of the means of production

442
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,200
to make these decisions, which I think is a far worse outcome for the planet than if we have

443
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,880
scientists who are thinking about environmental sustainability making these decisions. And we can

444
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,360
also have regional councils so that it isn't all being decided at the global level. That might be

445
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:24,640
another way to kind of create less centralized power within that council. Or maybe like competing

446
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,800
councils. If you have three councils that each have maybe also different approaches,

447
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,480
scientific approaches towards looking at the question and then later on is democratically

448
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,560
decided upon which path we want to choose. I think at many points within your book,

449
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:49,520
I was thinking, okay, you have this general body that is described with great detail and then there

450
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:56,880
are some peripheries that somebody else will have to look into a bit more and then work out

451
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,280
in greater detail because it's actually not possible to have it all. And maybe not a good

452
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,440
way to approach it. If everything is written down in the greatest detail, every aspect,

453
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:20,560
it's not possible, I think. I think we still have to do some work in order to create this image

454
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:30,240
within our listeners' minds to get an idea of how this society and how my individual life would

455
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,560
look like. Because I mean, we talked about this general catalog, I can register my needs,

456
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,120
I will have to go to work. That's an important point. I think that you made, I will have to go

457
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:49,120
to work. But how much I will have to work will depend upon how tedious, actually how popular

458
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:55,040
the work is that I'm doing. So if the work is really very popular, then I will have to work

459
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,000
a bit longer than the person who is doing the shitty work that nobody wants to do.

460
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,200
We already talked about that everybody will be organized in workers council. That is actually

461
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:15,200
the name for the socialist enterprise. I think in the book, you also mentioned subcommittees

462
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,280
for different works within the workers council, employment subcommittees and stuff like that.

463
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,280
I think one important point that we will have to mention is the legal right of guardianship,

464
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:38,400
that would be an interesting point that you maybe can explain a bit more. And I think another one

465
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:48,400
would be the question of price formation, because that was a very important point. I think who decides

466
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:58,800
upon how much a given use value actually costs. So maybe let's start with the legal right of guardianship

467
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,560
within the workers council. What is that legal right of guardianship?

468
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:11,680
Well, within the Marxian tradition, a mode of production also gives or has an associated

469
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,960
superstructure, which includes all of the cultural and legal and religious and political

470
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:26,320
aspects of society. So I felt the need to in defining the socialist mode of production

471
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:34,800
to explain at least to this some of the elements of the superstructure that would go with it. And

472
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,680
so one of these is the legal relationship between the workers and the means of production.

473
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,560
In capitalist societies, it's the right of private property that is the dominant form of property.

474
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:56,480
Means of production are privately owned. So I felt the need to specify a type of ownership

475
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,640
for the socialist mode of production. And it's based on collective or communal ownership,

476
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:10,480
but that doesn't mean that everyone just simply owns every factory. Instead, it's the workers

477
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,720
councils, the workers who are members of that workers council who work at a particular workplace

478
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,640
are considered guardians. And this is the legal form of ownership in the socialist mode of

479
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,840
production, as I've defined it. So each member of a workers council is also a guardian. They

480
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:35,040
are charged with using those means of production in the direction of the fulfillment of social needs

481
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,360
and in making sure that those means of production are used properly and for that end.

482
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,400
As I understood it, it's a bit like a cooperative, but without being the owner of the means of

483
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,600
production, actually. So you have these responsibilities, you have rights assigned to

484
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:00,400
it, but it's just not a ownership of means of productions, no?

485
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,880
Yes, that's right. Because if the workers, for example, couldn't decide, hey, we want to sell

486
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,600
our means of production to a private owner, that's not an option.

487
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,600
But there's still, and I think that's very important for our listeners as well,

488
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:25,600
there is still personal property, no? So apart from the ownership of means of productions,

489
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:32,720
if you buy something from the general catalog, it will still be yours.

490
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:41,680
Yes, that's correct. And I think for me, that was one of the important discoveries that made me

491
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:50,960
understand what socialism means. Many people, I think, have a fear that even personal possessions

492
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:57,280
wouldn't be privately controlled or owned anymore. And so I think this distinction between private

493
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,920
ownership or private property and personal property is very important. When you purchase

494
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,600
a use value, it becomes yours. Your relationship to that is a private relationship. You're going

495
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:13,920
to consume that privately, and therefore, that kind of property right should be different from

496
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:20,320
the right of private ownership of the means of production. Because private

497
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:27,200
ownership of the means of production is really what creates these class conflicts. When someone

498
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:33,600
owns them, then they're in a position where they can appropriate the surplus labor of other people.

499
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,000
And that's what's giving rise to these problems, these huge systemic problems.

500
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:48,880
I think another huge problem is the profit motive as such. And you have a kind of clever move, I

501
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:57,760
think, to eliminate this as well. And that is that you detach the question how much people are being

502
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:06,560
paid within the workers council. You detach this from the question of how much is being produced.

503
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:13,280
So this kind of tries to escape this destructive logic actually of for-profit orientation. Maybe

504
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,000
could you explain this a bit more? Because I think this is a really crucial point actually.

505
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:26,080
Sure. The way I describe it is that workers would be paid according to a formula,

506
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:31,840
basically. There would be a base income when they first enter a profession, and then their

507
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:37,760
income would grow as they remain in that line of work and become more experienced at it.

508
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:44,800
So workers councils don't have control of that part of work income. But what they do have control

509
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,160
of is effort ratings. So within a workers council, there would be an effort rating subcommittee

510
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:59,840
where workers would evaluate the performance of their co-workers. So within some limits that I

511
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:07,520
think would be global limits, a workers council could assign a percentage increase, let's say,

512
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:16,160
annually for performing one's work well, or it could be lower, so within some limits.

513
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,240
So incomes then are being determined in this way, and that's completely separate from

514
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:30,480
enterprise revenues. There is no sense in which workers councils, socialist enterprises would be

515
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:39,200
selling use values and receiving revenues, and then some of those revenues are used for expenses

516
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,640
and then for profit. Those categories don't exist in this kind of society. People's incomes are

517
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:50,480
entirely being driven by work and by the bonus income from registering their needs, and so it

518
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,720
abolishes profit. And it has to, because if this is going to be a society that abolishes capital,

519
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,040
you can't have profit as an economic category.

520
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:07,440
And how is price being determined? I already touched upon it before, but this is a crucial

521
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,000
question for many and I like the way you approached it. How is it being done?

522
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,760
When workers perform work and they receive income, I say that they receive it in the form of credits

523
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:26,480
and also the bonus income from registering needs and purchasing the use values for which

524
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:34,000
one registered in need that's paid in credits to. These credits are used to purchase the use values

525
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:41,280
and when the use values are being priced, they're being priced entirely to

526
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:52,320
sell the total amount during that purchase period. So the goal is to just clear the market

527
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,920
essentially and also to pursue the steady and complete sale of the use values. So the workers

528
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,960
council might raise the prices if the use values are being sold very quickly. If they're not being

529
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:12,400
sold quickly, it can reduce the prices of the use values. If they look like they won't be all sold

530
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:18,720
by the end of the purchase period, then they could be even reduced to zero. So some use values may

531
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:24,080
be given away freely. It helps to resolve one of the contradictions I think that we see in capitalist

532
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:30,720
societies where you'd have a depression, people in need and then you'd have goods on shelves that

533
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,040
can't be sold. It eliminates that because now workers councils would see that and they would

534
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:43,600
have no incentive. They're not making profit from the sale of these use values so they can just

535
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,880
put the prices down to zero and people who need these use values can acquire them.

536
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,440
And the reason why they didn't overproduce in the first place is that their production was

537
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,240
oriented towards the communicated needs from the consumers, no?

538
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,200
Yes, that's right. Actually, I think that's a great point and that would help to cut down

539
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:13,440
on the problem of overproduction as well. The fact that planning is being done in such a careful way

540
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,520
at the individual level. I think we didn't say that because that's an important information for

541
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,160
the listener as well. If you register your needs within the general catalog, you shouldn't register

542
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,160
like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of needs that you actually do not need because if you do

543
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:39,520
so, then you won't be getting the bonuses because how much bonus you get is oriented towards the

544
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:45,120
medium of how much needs were registered by everybody, no? Something like that.

545
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:52,480
Yes, and actually in the paper that I have on my Selected Works page, I include some different

546
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:59,200
parts of this bonus and one part is a conservation bonus. So a person who actually includes fewer

547
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:06,400
needs in their profile will receive a bonus for that. So there's flexibility in the system.

548
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,160
The way I've set it up, maybe people would decide to do it differently,

549
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,080
but I'm at least proposing some ways in which to tackle certain problems and one is by creating

550
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,760
an incentive for people to limit how many needs they register. They're putting less strain on

551
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:30,000
society's resources and so they deserve a bonus for that. So that's another element.

552
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:39,840
How is the superstructure being decided upon? Because for me, the question of how to approach

553
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:46,480
these bonus schemes and how people are being disciplined through penalties and such,

554
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:55,120
it's something I intuitively tend to reject, I have to say. I think it's because of the implicit

555
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:04,000
image of humans that is kind of evoked there. I think I get the point that you're making

556
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,360
because you're kind of trying to not be utopian but realistic somehow. It's not a communist society

557
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:19,840
yet, but a socialist one, people will have to go to work and they will not be 100% altruistic

558
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:28,320
all the time. Of course, one will still have these capitalist logics internalized as well.

559
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:35,520
Of course, there are limits to our resources. I kind of read the whole thing as saying,

560
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,480
come on, people, let's be honest here. We need some kind of rules. We need some kind of mechanism

561
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:52,080
to organize our behavior towards a behavior that is better for all of us. But still,

562
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:01,040
something within me is struggling with this approach of market design and mechanism design.

563
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:07,520
Somehow, I feel that. I think we will get there within the interview, but first, how would this

564
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:14,800
be decided upon in the superstructure, as I said, the schemes of bonuses and stuff like that?

565
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:26,240
Yes, that is a great question. I think it would need to be decided through open and democratic

566
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:34,560
debate. During this transition period, there would be the need for a socialist state or a

567
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:40,080
proletarian state to actually implement all this. There would be democratically elected

568
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:47,200
representatives who would work out these details. I think the important point is that everyone,

569
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:56,400
every single person, would be subject to the same incentives. Whatever ends up being decided,

570
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,000
everyone will be affected in the same way. I think that is very important. The bonus for

571
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:09,200
registering your need and then actually making the purchase. The bonus for leaving items out

572
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,720
of your needs profile if there is a penalty for purchasing use values for which you did not

573
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:21,360
register a need. As long as all of those incentives are the same throughout the population,

574
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:28,000
I think it will avoid becoming the kind of authoritarian solution that we might fear.

575
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:36,240
Okay, so let's try to tackle the underlying question of freedom and the individual there,

576
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:45,120
because I think even though I kind of stumble over some of these market design elements and

577
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:53,120
incentive logics, I get your point. I think, I hope, but there will be people out there who

578
01:03:53,120 --> 01:04:01,360
will be saying, oh, come on, that's the next Stalin coming up and stuff like that. The question

579
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:09,680
of freedom and the question of the individual is a crucial one, I think, if you want to bring in as

580
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:17,440
many people as possible. Let's try to kind of work out your position on whether or not this is a

581
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:26,800
free society or not. So which conception of freedom is emphasized within your proposal

582
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:33,760
and to which conception of the individual does it relate? The individual is free to communicate

583
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,760
one's needs and to know that those needs have an equal impact on the use of global resources.

584
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,880
So that's a new kind of freedom, I think, that doesn't currently exist in our society and one

585
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:55,360
that people will appreciate. They don't recognize that we could even have such a freedom. So I think

586
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:01,520
that's something I want to emphasize. Also, the individual is free to receive compensation for

587
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:08,880
work that contributes to the social product. So labor that is performed in serving human needs,

588
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,840
there is a right to compensation for that. But there are freedoms that are lost, I will

589
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,560
acknowledge. I mean, the freedom to acquire income at the expense of other people, that goes away.

590
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,000
That's a sad loss.

591
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,440
All right. So some of what is considered liberty in capitalist societies goes away.

592
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,960
People will not own businesses. They won't hire workers and then live off the profits. Now,

593
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,720
for some, that will be a major loss, especially small business owners who are also workers

594
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:48,960
in those businesses. They will feel that as a tremendous loss. I think that we have to recognize

595
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,520
that there will be some tradeoffs if we move to something radically different. And it seems like

596
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:02,720
we're in some ways being forced to pursue these different alternatives. In addition, people will

597
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,960
not own shares of stock and collect dividends as distributions of profit that have been produced

598
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:15,280
by workers. That will go away, that kind of stock ownership, because compensation will be based on

599
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:20,400
work as a member of a worker's council. It won't be based on ownership of means of production,

600
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,240
which is essentially what stock ownership represents. And finally, the individual will

601
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,000
live and work in a manner that forms a harmonious connection to other human beings and to the

602
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,640
natural world. That's really what we're kind of striving for with this sort of society,

603
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,680
that kind of harmony that defenders of capitalism say applies to capitalism, a kind of social

604
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:50,320
harmony. But critics of capitalism have always denied that. And so this is aimed at trying to

605
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:55,040
create that sort of harmonious connection. So there will be freedoms that are gained

606
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:01,280
in the new society, self-management in the workplace, workers who currently have no power

607
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,400
and no say in what happens will have a voice. But there will be freedoms that are lost.

608
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,160
And so I think we need to be honest about that as well.

609
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:19,200
So, I mean, obviously, if you have a general catalogue and you have this administrative body

610
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:29,440
that is administering this general catalogue, the question of privacy immediately pops up.

611
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:35,520
There's only credit, so this means everything is registered, no? And would there still be

612
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,960
some way to purchase stuff anonymously?

613
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:49,120
That's a good question. I think anonymous purchases of use values will be possible.

614
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,840
All purchases really can be anonymous, but the information will enter the system. So there's

615
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:01,680
a difference there. And are you concerned about the information being communicated to the system

616
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,520
or it being made public?

617
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:10,160
Well, I don't think that it will be made public because that would be a definite privacy breach.

618
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:18,640
But I think there's the concern of misuse. That's one side. And then there's a subjective feeling

619
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:25,120
of being surveilled or not. Right now, if I want to purchase something that I

620
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:33,600
want, for whatever reason, if I'm sick and I don't want my employer to know

621
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:40,960
whatever, this and that, and I can purchase the medicine anonymously and nobody will ever know,

622
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:48,960
or there are other things that people just don't want to communicate via consumption

623
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:56,080
to whatever system, I guess. So there are both sides to that, at least, I guess.

624
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:05,920
If this became a widespread way of organizing economic activity, if this became the dominant

625
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,440
mode of production, then opportunities to make purchases in the way you're describing

626
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:18,000
would diminish greatly. And so that may be something that we would lose.

627
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:24,800
However, I do think that in this system where people's incomes are not derived from

628
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:33,840
profit or ownership of capital, that there would be much less reason for someone to try to

629
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:42,400
use the information or even care about the information. If you want to make a specific

630
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:48,480
purchase, there isn't someone who's going to want to really aggressively market to you.

631
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:55,120
And so I think the potential for abuse would be greatly diminished as well.

632
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,400
I'm not sure about that. I think there will still be a danger there. There are different kinds of

633
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:11,760
misuse as well, but maybe one should consult the cryptography folks there and try to find some

634
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:18,960
technological rerouting because there are things like, I think it's called zero knowledge proofs

635
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,840
and stuff like that. So where it is possible to communicate a certain type of information,

636
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,200
but still sealing another type of information that is kind of bound to it.

637
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:39,200
So maybe there are some technological workarounds for providing privacy, but still

638
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:47,680
implementing a system like that. I think that would be an open question to me, that privacy

639
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:55,440
concern, I think. I think those are good ideas. Yeah. Let's talk to the crypto folks.

640
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:08,320
I guess. Another question is that of coercion. So if somebody does not want to work in your

641
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:17,440
proposed scheme of things, they say, oh, come on, you socialist guy. I don't support your system.

642
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,920
I don't want to work in that kind of society. I have my small business. I laughed at it and

643
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:33,280
you took it away. I'm angry. Yeah, I'm glad you brought that scenario up. I'm not suggesting that

644
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:41,120
there would be that kind of coercive intervention where the state would take someone's business. In

645
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,560
fact, I want to avoid that kind of coercive intervention as much as possible in this kind

646
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,800
of transition. If a person owned their own business and were the only worker in that business,

647
01:11:53,440 --> 01:12:01,600
then nothing would change for them. If they employ other workers, then the one

648
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:08,800
coercive element in this whole thing, if you want to use the word coercion, it would occur in the

649
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:18,800
transition because at some point the workers at a workplace would need to establish their right of

650
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,080
guardianship. And so they would need to seize the property. They would need to take control of the

651
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:31,200
property. That's where it happens. It could happen in a small business if there were enough workers

652
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:37,040
who wanted to run it themselves. But yeah, it couldn't happen in a business where there was

653
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:43,680
just one person because they already control those means of production. But also, workers don't need

654
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,400
to participate in this revolution either. They can choose to work for privately owned capitalist

655
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:54,000
firms and continue to buy and sell commodities. Their ability to do that is going to decline as

656
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,520
more workers participate in the transition to a new mode of production. So it's really just this

657
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,760
coercive element only comes in when the workers take possession of the means of production

658
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,720
and workers establish this right of guardianship.

659
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:13,040
Okay, that's interesting. So you're already kind of pointing towards the question of transition.

660
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,880
We will get there. But first, I'm very interested in the point that you were raising.

661
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:26,640
How small can a workers council actually be? Is it okay if it's just two people, but both of them

662
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,960
have equal rights within this workers council? So they have what today would be called a small

663
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:42,480
business, but it's a small cooperative slash workers council. Would that be possible?

664
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,920
Yes, I think it could be. Now, the system can involve some limits on this. So

665
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:58,720
let's suppose that a very small workers council is formed and posts to use values. And then

666
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:05,200
consumers start to include those use values in their needs profiles. Points then would be

667
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,360
communicated to that small council and the council could use the points to get inputs

668
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:17,280
to produce those use values. One could, I think, say that since those workers are receiving income

669
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:24,560
for that work, we might not want the points to fall below a certain level in order for them to

670
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:32,560
qualify as a workers council to earn that income. So maybe as a minimum number of points per worker

671
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,920
that has to be achieved before you can even have this happen. Otherwise, there'd be abuse, right?

672
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,800
I mean, you could have workers who are just really not doing anything or are only receiving a few

673
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,080
points and doing very little work and getting a full year's income every year, and we wouldn't

674
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,840
want that. So we would have to have, again, probably some global limits on what the minimum

675
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:00,800
number of points would be per workers council so that we're ensuring that actually there is

676
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,920
useful work being done towards fulfillment of needs. And that actually touches on upon

677
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:18,160
another aspect that is kind of interesting. It is possible for workers councils to post new ideas

678
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:24,240
into the catalog. So I think that's a really important point to make because it's not about

679
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:30,640
a centralized authority that comes up with, oh, we need 100 of this and 100 of that. But it's

680
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:40,240
the information and also the ability for innovation is placed within the workers council. So they can

681
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:46,320
post a new use value in the catalog, and then people can scroll through the catalog. And if

682
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,960
they like it, they will eventually put it on their needs profile. And then it will, if it's

683
01:15:52,960 --> 01:16:00,400
not just one person, but you know, as you said, some amount is involved, then it will be produced.

684
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:09,280
And I really like that about your proposal. Another question that relates to the overall

685
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:15,280
topic of freedom and individuality that we're talking about right now is the question of

686
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:23,440
unconditional universal basic income, actually, because that is something that does not exist in

687
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:29,760
your proposal, actually, but it is something that is getting quite some traction right now.

688
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:37,600
And many people are in favor of because it kind of it seems to provide a different kind of freedom,

689
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,680
you know, and I actually I like that about the idea of unconditional basic income as well,

690
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:50,480
that I get the sense of, okay, I do not have to think about my existential needs anymore.

691
01:16:50,480 --> 01:17:00,000
These are covered. And from this, I get a very, you know, energizing prospect of okay, now I can

692
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:12,320
really put my my energy to use wherever I think it might fit the best. And, and but you're kind of

693
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,200
proposing something different, you have a base income, but it's not unconditional, you have to

694
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:22,720
you will have to work for that. Why did you decide against the unconditional basic income?

695
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:30,400
Yeah, it's a great question. I think the aim of this new mode of production is to ensure that

696
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,600
people receive compensation for their useful work, and not that they receive compensation,

697
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,680
regardless of what they do. So the idea behind a universal basic income, I think it's an

698
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,840
ethical principle that's not really consistent with my understanding of socialism, which,

699
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:55,200
which many might find surprising. But I think it's and I even think it's inconsistent with

700
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:01,040
Marxism, actually, because I think Marx's description of the lower phase of communism

701
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:07,360
was consistent, even though he didn't put it quite in these terms, with the principle from

702
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:13,760
each according to one's ability to each according to one's work. And so within the socialist phase,

703
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:20,160
keeping the incentives there to continue working and producing is important. I think when you move

704
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:25,920
to the higher phase of communism, what Marx Marx described as higher phase of communism described

705
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,800
as from each according to one's ability to each according to one's need, then you move closer to

706
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:39,200
something like that, where all you need to do is register your needs in order to have access to

707
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:44,960
the things you need. Although, although even there, because you have to contribute as you're able,

708
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,320
you do need to engage in some kind of productive work. But this can be broadly defined. And I think

709
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:56,960
you know, care work is one possibility, a person need not go to a traditional workplace away from

710
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,400
the home in order to do this. You know, even though I appreciate the idea behind a universal

711
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:08,640
basic income, I think in trying to stick to those ethical principles that I understand,

712
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:15,760
that relate to socialism, communism, it didn't seem to fit. And that's why I didn't don't have that

713
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,600
as part of the proposal.

714
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,920
This has been the first of two episodes on the topic of digital socialism and the abolition of

715
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:28,880
capital with my guest, Daniel E. Saros. I hope you enjoyed it. Please let me know what you think

716
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,840
about the topic and write me if you know about interesting thinkers or practitioners for that

717
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,720
matter, that might bring in important contributions to the discussion. This is an ongoing engagement,

718
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:47,440
matter that might bring in important contributions to the discussion. This is an ongoing engagement.

719
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:52,240
So there will be more episodes that explore different aspects of what I'd like to call

720
01:19:52,880 --> 01:20:00,160
the socialist calculation debate 2.0. You can write me via future underscore histories at

721
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:06,400
protonmail.com. And you can be a part of the discussion on Twitter or on the future histories

722
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,720
subreddit. So long, have a good time. Hear you in two weeks.
