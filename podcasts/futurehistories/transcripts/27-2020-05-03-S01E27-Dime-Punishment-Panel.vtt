00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Welcome everybody to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and today you'll hear a recording of a panel I organized and moderated in February 2020 as part of my research fellowship at the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society.

00:16.000 --> 00:30.000
The panel critically discusses the expansion of cryptoeconomics into an art of government and I am very happy that I was able to bring together Jaya, Clara Brecke, Benjamin Seibel and Martin Köppelmann as panelists.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Jaya and Benjamin have both been guests to Future Histories before, so check out their episodes as well.

00:38.000 --> 00:57.000
I'd like to send my warmest thanks and greetings to the research group 17 at the Weizenbaum Institute who hosted my stay there and greetings actually to everybody at the Weizenbaum because I really, really, really enjoyed my stay there and I loved the many interesting and inspiring discussions.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
It was an actually perfect research environment, I have to say. So thanks a lot.

01:03.000 --> 01:14.000
And since I am actually already in the mode of wholehearted gratitude, I'd like to thank Ludwig and welcome him as a Patreon of Future Histories.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
And I'd like to thank Vicky, Fabian and Bernhard for their contributions. Thanks a thousand times. This really helps a lot.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
But now, please enjoy the panel Dime and Punishment, Cryptoeconomics as an Art of Government.

01:36.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm very happy to have the opportunity to host this panel tonight with this awesome guest, which I'm really excited about to bring together. It's Jaya, Clara Brecke, Benjamin Seibel and Martin Köppelmann.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Maybe you could introduce yourself just a little.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Sure. Hello, everyone. I'm Jaya.

01:58.000 --> 02:07.000
I have been kind of tracing the emergence of the field of crypto economics pretty much since the beginning of Ethereum.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I started writing a PhD that was a political analysis of blockchain.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I wanted to understand how can you understand something like blockchain politically?

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
And that was right around the time when Ethereum had its first DEVCON.

02:21.000 --> 02:41.000
And so for me, it's been kind of a curious journey of understanding the ways that I guess like kind of existing or kind of historical economic theories are rehashed and reconfigured through the development of protocols that actually come from a very different set of concerns,

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
namely usually kind of security questions, network security questions.

02:46.000 --> 02:56.000
So this kind of interesting mishmash and the emergence of crypto economics as a field that's kind of distinct from previous economic ideas.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
That's, I guess, like broadly my interest, but in relation to this panel anyway.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
But yeah, within that, I also kind of look more at, I guess, power dynamics, questions of governance, this kind of thing, too.

03:10.000 --> 03:20.000
That's a brief. So right now I'm doing a postdoc at Durham University, but I am on strike today, so I do not represent Durham University.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
They're not paying me to be here.

03:23.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm here as a general interested person that is kind of following this field and writes a lot about this field, speaks a lot about this field.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah. Hi, I'm Benjamin.

03:41.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, Jan invited me here as, I guess, an expert on governmental technologies because I wrote a book about it a few years ago.

03:52.000 --> 04:04.000
A PhD thesis about cybernetics, actually, and the influence it had on governmental discourses in the postwar periods, like from 1945 to 1970, basically.

04:04.000 --> 04:17.000
So very early, the emergence of digital technologies, but also of a kind of theoretical discourse around these technologies and how it influenced politics and governmental thinking in this period.

04:17.000 --> 04:28.000
And I think we still see the consequences of these developments today, or maybe we even see them just today more than in the past.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
Anyway, I no longer work in academia and also not an expert on crypto economics, but Jan told me that is just fine.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
So I hope I still can contribute something to the discussion.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
I work in civic tech and technology activism, basically here in Berlin for about five years now.

04:47.000 --> 04:59.000
I also work a lot with the government on digital developments and how to implement these technologies in a way that benefits citizens.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, I'm Martin Kuppelmann.

05:02.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm a software engineer and interested in blockchain, first Bitcoin eight years ago or something like that, and then mainly Ethereum.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I founded the project or company now called Gnosis.

05:19.000 --> 05:30.000
We are building prediction markets and a bunch of other infrastructure and markets on Ethereum.

05:30.000 --> 05:52.000
Another side project I initiated is a project called Circles, where we're trying to advance the course of universal basic income via blockchain technology and introducing new currencies.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
I hope somehow for me, it totally makes sense to bring together all these specific people, actually.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
And the umbrella is the title of this panel tonight, Diamond Punishment Cryptoeconomics as an Art of Government.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm quite sure that not everybody is familiar with the topic, so I think we should kind of lay out some basic thoughts about it.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
Maybe let's simply start with the definition of cryptoeconomics, Jaya, do you want to start?

06:25.000 --> 06:41.000
Yes, well, I guess, you know, I'm not going to give you a kind of like little spiffy one liner, but more just to say that I guess the easiest way to describe cryptoeconomics is to trace it back to Bitcoin mining basically.

06:41.000 --> 06:53.000
And the idea of using, you know, on a very basic level, economic incentives and rewards in order to achieve certain network security characteristics in a decentralized peer to peer network scenario.

06:53.000 --> 07:03.000
And that is like, you know, that's been done, you know, that's kind of been a kind of field of experimentation ever since then.

07:03.000 --> 07:16.000
And has added more and more economic concepts, more and more ideas around how markets function and so on that I'm sure Martin can say a lot more about in terms of the practical experiments that's been done around that.

07:16.000 --> 07:32.000
But I think for me, what's interesting about that is that, you know, I come from a background, a kind of theoretical and political background that's extremely critical of the use of markets in trying to kind of govern social relations.

07:32.000 --> 07:42.000
And I remain very critical of that, you know, I think there's a severe limitation to what markets can and should do in societies.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
Nevertheless, I think it's like a super interesting field to look at how it interacts exactly with network security and network security protocols.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
And so, you know, I follow these experiments with with lots of interest and openness to.

07:59.000 --> 08:20.000
One of the reasons why I'm interested in cryptoeconomics as an art of government is kind of more or less recent development where these types of actually design these design paradigms of cryptoeconomics reach over into the sphere of the social even more and are proclaimed to become a new social technology.

08:20.000 --> 08:31.000
There's this collaboration between Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, one of the largest blockchain platforms, and an economist called Glenn Whale.

08:31.000 --> 08:47.000
And they kind of joined forces and more or less tried to develop tried to develop a what they call political theory based on radical markets, which are actually markets based on mechanism design.

08:47.000 --> 08:58.000
And yeah, mostly on mechanism design, which is a type of game theoretical thinking and the combination with blockchain technology and cryptoeconomics.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
And this is proclaimed to become a new social technology, which can create some kind of legitimacy within a space of anonymity.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
And before the panel, that's the that's the idea roughly.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
Not sure about that. In that particular context, I'm not sure about the anonymity.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I think. Yeah, that's true.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
In that case, they very clearly say we need identity and one person, one vote and stuff like that.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, it's true.

09:28.000 --> 09:47.000
Why I'm making this this longer introduction is I'd be keen on your position of what you think that cryptoeconomics actually is, because when we were talking before the panel, you kind of sketched it in a kind of broader sense, also political sense.

09:47.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm again, I have not really thought or it's I guess just just feeling it's not not trying to to define those terms.

09:58.000 --> 10:10.000
But a few few things that come to my mind when I when I think about it is, first of all, that we have a space where there there is no arbitrator or judge.

10:10.000 --> 10:19.000
So like like if we are here interacting with each other, there's always the assumption whatever we do, there is a state and there is something above us.

10:19.000 --> 10:35.000
And if we do some form of interaction, if I go into a shop and buy something, then then the interaction is not just defined by the two of us, but it's defined by a whole construct above us.

10:36.000 --> 10:46.000
And in those blockchain in the blockchain world, we're trying to make interactions between possible.

10:46.000 --> 10:55.000
We are trying to make interactions between people possible, even in the absence of such an overarching state.

10:55.000 --> 11:15.000
And the very practical consequences is that something as simple as as having ten people that are somewhere in the world and let's say ten different countries and they together want to have a bank account.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
So they together want to say, OK, we have here a thousand dollars and we want to control that together.

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
That would be extremely complex to set up outside of blockchain.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
I mean, you could, I mean, you could, I guess, form a company, but that would need to be in one restriction.

11:34.000 --> 11:44.000
And then it would be what cost you thousands, maybe ten thousand dollars to just maybe much more to set up such a construct in blockchain world.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
That's super easy and cost you 20 cents.

11:47.000 --> 11:58.000
So you can just do what it's called the multisig, some shared account that that where the money sits and it's controlled by by by ten people.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
And there can be basic rules like five or ten agree, then the money can be can be taken.

12:06.000 --> 12:22.000
And so I would define crypto economics as a space that can enforce rules without without such a government arbitrator that, of course, has consequences or like one is that it's always opt in.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
So in my view, so far, yeah, if I'm born in Germany, I don't have a choice to kind of pay taxes or not.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Kind of I'm kind of forced to play by the rules that that exist here.

12:37.000 --> 12:51.000
I would say so far in crypto economics, it's always an active decision to kind of, yeah, put something under those rules, which comes with the flip side that you usually first have to

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
put something in kind of which means mainly you have to first put in value.

12:58.000 --> 13:11.000
So unless you put in value or money or something money like usually you will not be able to to do to do anything.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I mean, then there may be a few more.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
So so I think the what you mentioned was was game theory.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I would maybe call it adversarial thinking.

13:21.000 --> 13:39.000
So like when when those systems are designed, I think the general mindset is that they try to build systems that work under worst case assumptions.

13:39.000 --> 13:52.000
So if I would just try to make one real world example, I think that like in the US, there were there were those primaries or the Democratic primaries.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
And I think there was a mess up like that.

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
They couldn't count the votes and someone designing crypto economic system would immediately say, OK, it's basically just those two guys who then report to that.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
That's a terrible system. That's kind of just those two guys.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
They would enough to collude.

14:08.000 --> 14:20.000
So we would kind of just from the mindset directly come with a different mindset and come with a mindset that tries to build systems that are more resilient.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I guess that's very interesting.

14:23.000 --> 14:39.000
And I think because we will come to a part of critique, actually, and I'll be keen on on looking at the at the assumptions, the anthropologies, so to speak, that are inscribed within this this type of thinking.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Because to me, it's even kind of paranoid somehow.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
And then that's specifically problematic when it comes to designing social spaces.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
You know, you always think that the next guy might stab you in the back.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, but I want to be more generous, actually, towards the whole thing.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
Before we get there, I'd like to ask Benjamin to maybe introduce us to the second part of the title, because it's Diamond Punishment Crypto Economics as an Art of Government.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
In German, that would be Regierungskunst.

15:11.000 --> 15:19.000
And Benjamin actually wrote quite a lot about the question of technology in relation to Regierungskunst.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
Could you maybe kind of brief us about it?

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
I could try. Yeah, it's already hard to sum up a book in a few sentences, but when it's been five years, it's even harder.

15:31.000 --> 15:41.000
When I started to write about the relation of technology and government, I found that on the one hand, throughout the history of political or governmental thinking,

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
you would always find these metaphors or models of machinery as the state.

15:46.000 --> 15:54.000
So even in past centuries, you would find these conceptions of the state being like a ship or like a clockwork or like a steam engine.

15:54.000 --> 16:05.000
And in the 20th century, of course, this gets replaced by looking at the state as kind of an information processing system or look at societies as kind of information processing systems.

16:05.000 --> 16:17.000
And these models have kind of a very bad reputation in political thinking, especially in like leftist political thinking, because they always look very reductionist, which they are, of course.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
So lots of very smart political thinkers actually assumed that these models were just wrong,

16:23.000 --> 16:35.000
which I found not satisfying because it was so obvious that these models actually had a huge impact on the way that government was thought,

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
but also how government was practiced because these technologies are not just like ideas.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
They are like materialities that can also be used as tools to actually govern people because governing people,

16:47.000 --> 16:55.000
and this is an idea that you will find in Foucault most prominently, is a very technological thing to do in a way.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
It's about control. It's about regulation. It's about setting environments where people can be regulated in some way.

17:02.000 --> 17:10.000
And of course, those people in power or governments can also use technologies as actual tools.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
So it's not just like we imagine society to be an information network, but once you imagine society to be an information network,

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
you can use computers or information networks to actually start controlling people through computers.

17:24.000 --> 17:32.000
The same way that, for example, Friedrich the Great tried to imagine his state as a clockwork

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
and control the people through discipline in a way like clockworks.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
So what I realized was that technologies or technological assemblages, which is more than just the artifacts,

17:47.000 --> 17:58.000
also the knowledge surrounding it and so on, that they offer spaces of possibility through which you can attempt to control a society,

17:58.000 --> 18:07.000
for example, which is always attempted because government in a way always tries to be at the state of the art of governing.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
So always trying to implement new technologies, to try new forms in regulating people better or worse.

18:14.000 --> 18:22.000
So you have these spaces of possibilities that then also shape your thinking on how you frame the problem.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Because for government, society is a problem to be controlled.

18:26.000 --> 18:37.000
And the way how you look at this problem, how you look at society is very much influenced from the technical conditions under which you actually operate.

18:37.000 --> 18:46.000
So that's what I kind of observed, how this image changed and moved to looking at societies as information systems or communication systems,

18:46.000 --> 18:55.000
but also looking at individuals as being rational actors, the whole homo-economics model, basically like computers.

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
How you started to look at individuals as self-regulating actors, lots like a cybernetic machine that works through feedback mechanisms.

19:04.000 --> 19:13.000
And then you start experimenting with this framework and with the possibilities that arise and try to figure out new ways of governing.

19:13.000 --> 19:24.000
And I think in this context, the whole blockchain thing that is often framed by evangelists as being something very disruptive and very revolutionary

19:24.000 --> 19:33.000
is actually just a logical next step that is still in the same framework like the cybernetic discourse of the 1950s was.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
In that sense, it's not very revolutionary, which doesn't make it good or bad.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
I would argue to look at it in a longer time span.

19:45.000 --> 19:54.000
But still, that would be the question. What specific type of new realm of possibilities is opened up through this technology?

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
Because I said that I want to be a bit more generous. I think there is something being opened up.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
My immediate response here would be, my perspective would be quite the opposite.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
You said something like a government wants to basically control or govern people.

20:10.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, to me, blockchain is really the possibility of people to cooperate without the government.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
To control themselves, basically.

20:21.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, of course. One thing we are dreaming of or working on is there are probably a million or more people in the world that care about climate change.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
They have no good way to coordinate.

20:41.000 --> 20:51.000
There is no good, as mentioned earlier, as soon as you do something international, companies are fine or whatever, what would you do?

20:51.000 --> 21:04.000
So to build that level of coordination that is independent of existing power structures, namely states and large corporations.

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
That is the thing that is promising to me.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
In the last consequence, it could mean getting rid of states.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
So I would say there is a revolutionary potential.

21:23.000 --> 21:38.000
I think for me what has been kind of curious has been the way that blockchain and the idea of decentralization that is advanced through blockchain tends to very much be about...

21:38.000 --> 21:49.000
It is a very different way of thinking about revolution because the transformation is less about a qualitative transformation, as in let's do things fundamentally differently.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
And more about let's decentralize all the existing ways of doing things so people can do that for themselves but in a decentralized way.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
And that for me is a bit curious. There is a difference there.

22:02.000 --> 22:12.000
There is a difference between lots of individuals running their own currencies and their own banks and centralized banks.

22:12.000 --> 22:24.000
That is a huge difference, but nevertheless the actual technologies tend to be very much like a replication of the existing ways of thinking about money, value, government.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
There are some experimentation at the edges, but it seems a little bit like there is...

22:30.000 --> 22:42.000
And again, it's sometimes very much a critique of mine, like a very strong critique in the very specific projects, but other times it's also an openness as in that's curious.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
I don't actually know what that means in terms of how it would play out.

22:47.000 --> 23:05.000
But there is a little bit this thing of like there is not a kind of strong conceptual critique of the state or the banking industry as much as it's just centralized and we need to decentralize.

23:05.000 --> 23:15.000
So like we look at what they're doing and what they're doing, they're doing, you know, specific things that instead of them doing it, we want everyone to be able to do it, if that makes sense.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
On a side note, the idea of getting rid of the state is like a key idea in cybernetic governmental thinking.

23:22.000 --> 23:31.000
Like in a perfectly controlled social system, you wouldn't need a state because everything would just keep everything in check.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
So I mean, I'm very fond of the positive or utopian ideas that are in there.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
But what interests me is aren't we substituting one form of control to another form of control?

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And how does this new form of control look like?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
Or what do we do with it?

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
Like 10 years ago, the idea was blockchain decentralized everything.

23:57.000 --> 24:05.000
And now it's like Facebook uses a blockchain to kind of decentralize everything, but still keep control of everything with Libra.

24:05.000 --> 24:19.000
So I think there's just a lot of work and academic work to do in trying to understand and grasp these decentralized power structures or even how new centralized power structures might emerge from it.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Because that's what we learned from the Internet of the last 30 years.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
A huge utopian emancipatory potential in the 90s.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
And we were all like, everything gets decentralized and we get rid of the old power structures and now look at the Internet today.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I mean, what happened?

24:36.000 --> 24:43.000
And I think just we need to work really hard to understand how decentralized power works.

24:43.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah, no, I mean, to some extent, it's technology or technological pieces that can be used in quite a range of ways.

24:54.000 --> 25:14.000
So you mentioned kind of like money or there is this project maker on Ethereum, which I would say kind of replicates how today central bank works.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
To some extent and but at the end, it's maybe not that different.

25:20.000 --> 25:36.000
So it's OK, maybe it's 20 large token holders that then vote and instead of the central bank where I don't know, seven people then at the end make the decision.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
So in that sense, it's not really that different.

25:39.000 --> 25:47.000
But blockchain also or the technology just opens up the field for much more experiments.

25:47.000 --> 25:59.000
So there is this maker, but there are also a hundred other currencies or currency systems or value systems that are currently being built and experimented.

25:59.000 --> 26:06.000
And not only that, there's also loads of experimentation in terms of governance, right?

26:06.000 --> 26:17.000
And I mean, not just in terms of kind of governance, like blockchain applications for governance, but more like the governance of blockchain protocols is wild.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
There's so many problems that keep coming up.

26:21.000 --> 26:36.000
And that's like an ongoing that for me is the real stuff, because that for me, like, first of all, has to do with this question of like, OK, we're we're arranging a kind of new decentralized protocol where what happens to power in the meantime.

26:36.000 --> 26:44.000
And a lot of that has to do with who determines, you know, whether the protocol is considered to work or be good or not and what need what changes need to be made.

26:44.000 --> 26:54.000
So far, like, you know, in terms of any kind of radical changes to protocols, that has to sit within a kind of like attack vector scenario.

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
So it's like if you want to modify the way that a given network is governed, then it needs to be coded into kind of attack vector type language.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
And then it's something that can actually be dealt with by developers in a sensible way.

27:07.000 --> 27:25.000
But the more kind of like the questions of how the protocols actually meet users in, you know, in their day to day lives and how users then push back on whether that protocol is actually performing something good in their lives or not is like still an open question mark in many ways.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
Again, so far, like, you know, there's been, you know, the hacks and the exploits and so on.

27:30.000 --> 27:38.000
And that's like, you know, been the kind of interesting cases of what do you do then?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
You know, who has the control of the protocol then?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
And then, of course, like forking as a governance mechanism around that.

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
But yeah, and there's lots of interesting stuff happening right now in terms of protocol governance in the space.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I'm still at the point of trying to be generous.

27:54.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm still asking myself, what exactly is the thing that crypt economics brings to the table?

28:03.000 --> 28:17.000
You know, if you consider all the critique, if you consider that like apart from all the bullshit, apart from all the hype, apart from all the OK, they are using like rational choice assumptions and everything.

28:17.000 --> 28:30.000
Is there still something left that opens up new spaces of possibilities, as you mentioned in relation to the question of technology as an art of government?

28:30.000 --> 28:38.000
And I'm asking this from a perspective of being like really critical towards all the things.

28:38.000 --> 28:52.000
My simplest answer would again be it enables people to cooperate across jurisdictions worldwide in a form that was previously not possible.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
But can we go into that cooperation a little bit more?

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Because like, you know, obviously people can call each other, right?

28:58.000 --> 29:07.000
And like, you know, you can call someone and organize something, you know, between lots of different locations.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
So it's a very specific kind of cooperation or collaboration that is enabled through blockchain, not because that communication happens already.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Relationships can be established. People can make agreements and so on and so forth.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
It's more specific than that, right?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Well, of course, yeah.

29:22.000 --> 29:29.000
And again, one example, the simplest example is just like having control of a budget together.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
That already is pretty hard to do, I would say.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
And then you can, of course, go on from there, but just as a...

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
So, yeah, again, this climate change thing.

29:40.000 --> 29:57.000
So there is a project, Dowstek, I'm somewhat involved with, where the idea is there are Facebook groups today with a million or sometimes 100,000 million people that are interested in some topic or something like that.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
But the group is very...

30:00.000 --> 30:07.000
But those groups could maybe do much more than or could have much higher impact.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
So imagine you would pay a one dollar a month membership kind of into this group.

30:13.000 --> 30:23.000
And then this group would have a budget and would have some procedures how to, well, then actually be able to spend that money.

30:23.000 --> 30:33.000
I have a hard time imagining that how to do this today, kind of how to set that up without blockchain.

30:33.000 --> 30:40.000
So that's some specific financial application that can be created through this technology.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
Because if you take it to a larger level of climate change, I'm not seeing how this is like...

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
How addressing climate change...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Greenpeace does that, right?

30:54.000 --> 31:02.000
Greenpeace, people pay a membership fee to Greenpeace and then they do stuff on climate and people see that as a kind of coordinating mechanism.

31:02.000 --> 31:14.000
And I mean, I get what you're saying that it's easier for smaller groups to self-organize that might not have access to be able to have a bank account and so on and so forth.

31:14.000 --> 31:24.000
But the big question here is what is it that the fact that Greenpeace does this versus another set of people...

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
There is a set of governance and legal jurisdictions and all that, which is it can be good, but it can be bad.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
But sometimes it is quite good.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
And especially when a given protocol gets hacked, it's quite good.

31:39.000 --> 31:48.000
Do you know what I mean? Sometimes there's a fallback onto existing legal systems and existing governance systems.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
That's like, man, people kind of...

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
OK, I would say that's the second next...

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
If we are still at the basis of what's the promise, then I would say, well, why not Greenpeace?

32:02.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah, I mean, again, I don't know how Greenpeace is structured legally globally.

32:11.000 --> 32:22.000
I assume they have in many jurisdictions some entities and I think it has overall probably tremendous costs in just maintaining that legal structure.

32:22.000 --> 32:31.000
So that would simply be an enormous reduction of costs of setting up such a structure.

32:31.000 --> 32:40.000
And then, of course, the imagination is that it's much more participatory.

32:40.000 --> 32:48.000
So instead of just kind of paying a membership fee to Greenpeace and then I think...

32:48.000 --> 32:57.000
I'm not a member, but I assume you don't have kind of direct voting rights on stuff and how that money is spent.

32:57.000 --> 33:05.000
And I would say that is also because it's just complicated and expensive to set those structures up.

33:05.000 --> 33:22.000
And I would say with this technology that those costs to set up governments, governance structures can be reduced significantly.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
And that makes it just possible to do things that were previously not possible.

33:28.000 --> 33:43.000
So one example I sometimes bring in just how the reduction of costs introduces new things is the Internet reduced, of course, the costs of submitting information tremendously.

33:43.000 --> 33:57.000
So like 30 years ago, if you wanted to express something as unimportant as you like this picture,

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
well, you would not write a letter to someone and say, I like this picture.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
With Facebook, of course, you click the like button.

34:03.000 --> 34:11.000
And that's kind of one example of the cost of submitting this information was reduced by a factor of 1000 or a million.

34:11.000 --> 34:19.000
And with blockchain technology, the costs of not submitting information, but submitting transactions.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
So sending a token or casting a vote that can trigger something,

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
kind of this transactional cost is reduced by a factor or can be reduced by a factor of a million.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
And that will open up a new space.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
I mean, don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't think there's anything interesting about that.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
I think there's plenty of interesting things. Otherwise, it wouldn't be in the space.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
But it's more that I find it kind of problematic that there is a lot of kind of discussions that tend to happen in and around blockchain,

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
where it's like, oh, that would be that would never be possible without blockchain or, you know, when actually, yes, things are possible.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It just is a different way of doing things.

34:57.000 --> 35:07.000
And so there's this tendency to often kind of reduce social interactions to a kind of like very limited set of forms of interactions

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
and kind of reinterpret the whole world through that lens.

35:11.000 --> 35:20.000
And that's a little bit like man, come on, you know, like including things like no, sorry, I'll stop there because we'll get into that later.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
I'm sure questions of the state and sovereignty and all this kind of stuff.

35:25.000 --> 35:33.000
I mean, I think we're still in a very early stage where we just where it's important to also explore the possibilities and try out different things.

35:33.000 --> 35:43.000
For me, as a non-expert, the promise of blockchain technologies kind of lies in the possibility to design economic systems

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
down to a very micro transactional level and day to day level even.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
And I think there's huge possibilities, also huge problems there.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
But in theory, it's lots of interesting things is possible.

35:55.000 --> 36:05.000
It's not only that like tax evasion is no longer possible, but maybe also it's no longer possible to spend money on things that, you know, harm other people or harm the environment.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
Or maybe it's more expensive or maybe it's more expensive tomorrow than it is today.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
There's, as I said, there are lots of problems come with it.

36:13.000 --> 36:22.000
In theory, like compared to how our economic system works now, you can control things on a much tighter level for good or for worse.

36:22.000 --> 36:32.000
I mean, on that specific thing, I think tax evasion will come in a way also much easier again.

36:32.000 --> 36:40.000
There are those zero knowledge proofs and I mean, like so far, blockchain has been very, very, very transparent.

36:40.000 --> 36:53.000
So, but there is already the technology ready to make blockchain or to make transactions that are shielded or like that you cannot.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
You have a very hard time tracing from the outside what's going on.

37:02.000 --> 37:09.000
But I think what Benjamin is actually heading at is that it's a design question that, again, coming from his book,

37:09.000 --> 37:19.000
these technologies open up spaces and it's a question of a political conversation, of a political negotiation.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Thanks a lot.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
How we want to use this contingent space of possibility that is being opened up.

37:27.000 --> 37:44.000
And I think that one of the problems actually in the space is that the way that the question is looked upon is informed through lenses that I personally mostly do not share.

37:44.000 --> 37:51.000
Specifically in cryptoeconomics, there's this lens of game theoretic design, a game theoretic design perspective.

37:51.000 --> 38:01.000
And I'd like to talk a bit about this because this actually like builds the floor upon which the rest is then being imagined, actually.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
And to me, it's like highly flawed.

38:04.000 --> 38:14.000
Maybe I mentioned an author, Ariel Rubenstein, and he's actually a renowned economist in the field of cryptoeconomics, but game theory.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
And he wrote a book.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
And he wrote a book.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's called Economic Fables.

38:18.000 --> 38:28.000
And he talks about game theory from a perspective where he says, all right, I really, really enjoyed game theory as an intellectual pleasure in my professional life.

38:28.000 --> 38:42.000
But when it comes to real world applicability, I highly doubt that it's worth anything when it comes to the prediction of real behavior of humans, because it's just not a tool that you can use for this.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
And then what you end up with is a normative idea of how people should behave.

38:48.000 --> 38:59.000
And this I often find in cryptoeconomic systems design that you imagine a way of how you would like that people should behave.

38:59.000 --> 39:11.000
And this is mostly thought of as like strictly rational profit maximizing and actually alongside idea of rational choice theory.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
And that's how it's modeled.

39:12.000 --> 39:22.000
And then you build a system that tries to kind of force people to act in this way with a type of carrot and stick approach.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
That's how it seems to me.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I would say quite the opposite.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
I would say you imagine how people could behave worst case.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
And then you imagine how the others could behave worst case to you.

39:38.000 --> 39:46.000
And then you design the system that even if they all behave worst case for you, it kind of still works.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Yeah.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
I mean, and that is the security engineers perspective.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
And that I find really interesting to trace through, actually.

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
But there is something else that you said, which was the intellectual pleasure of game theory.

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
And I actually I honestly think that blockchain has become so big because it's intellectually pleasurable.

40:09.000 --> 40:20.000
Like, you know, it's just it puts forward a whole bunch of really interesting problems for political theorists, for economists, for mathematicians, for cryptographers, for computer engineers.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
You know, it's just an interesting set of problems to attack, whether those problems are actual real world problems or not.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
So, you know, maybe, maybe not.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
But honestly, you know, I feel that that's that that's the case.

40:36.000 --> 40:48.000
But yeah, in terms of the assumptions of game theory, like, you know, game theory is kind of like one big component in in crypto economics.

40:49.000 --> 41:11.000
But there is like something that I've been trying to think through and struggle with a little bit is this question of like exactly as Martin was saying, like whether, you know, there is an element of the kind of core engineering where, you know, modeling, you know, being so focused on modeling attacks makes sense because you want the kind of core engineering to be secure fundamentally.

41:11.000 --> 41:21.000
When it becomes problematic is when that becomes a kind of like model and a lens for understanding all social relationships and and kind of expanding from there, a kind of worldview and a political view.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
And that happens for some reason or another very quickly in the blockchain space.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
When I was writing my PhD, I was running through it.

41:29.000 --> 41:48.000
I did a little kind of experiment where I was trying to kind of work through the concept of trustlessness, which is like a major kind of like concept in the blockchain space and in crypto, crypto economics, you know, and trustlessness kind of defines a kind of threshold of trust that is required in order for the system to function securely.

41:48.000 --> 42:00.000
So there's a famous kind of 51% attack and all these kinds of things where, you know, how many nodes in the network would need to collude in order for the network to then become, you know, biased or owned or whatever else.

42:00.000 --> 42:13.000
And what I wanted to understand was like the way that trust and trustlessness was kind of conceptualized and worked with in a very rigorous way amongst computer engineers.

42:13.000 --> 42:23.000
And yet for anyone actually engaging with blockchain systems and crypto economic systems and so on, a lot of trust is required, right?

42:23.000 --> 42:30.000
Like you need to kind of like trust what you've read on a website, you need to trust, you know, the exchange rates on a kind of crypto exchange and so on and so forth.

42:30.000 --> 42:38.000
Like you're never as an individual able to run go through, you know, all the GitHub code repositories in order to make sure that everything is super secure.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Like you actually need to trust a lot of people to engage with these systems.

42:42.000 --> 42:54.000
So where is it that that kind of like mythical trustlessness that blockchain provides and the actual social reality where a lot of trust is required, where does that meet and how is that articulated?

42:54.000 --> 43:04.000
And that's exactly the kind of like areas where, you know, then you do start to see a lot of scams and you do see start to see a lot of kind of security breaches and so on.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But it's it's a kind of it.

43:07.000 --> 43:32.000
I think it's also one of the reasons why the kind of security protocol so quickly becomes a political and social imagination, because you're trying to produce, you know, the effort of the security engineers to try to produce something that is, you know, stable as a kind of political, social, legal and economic system through cryptography and through math, right?

43:32.000 --> 43:53.000
And so, you know, the more that you see that it doesn't play out that way in reality, the more you need to bring reality into into those kind of conditions of trustlessness, the more you need to kind of like add more things on some blockchain, you know, like put it out into IOT and, you know, get more because everything outside of the trustless network is just is, you know, dodgy potentially, right?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Sorry, a little rant.

43:54.000 --> 44:12.000
I think also from a broader perspective, this point of trust is super interesting to me, because maybe that's even the key behind the whole blockchain thing is it tries to replace a social mechanism of trust that has a long history with a technological mechanism, which makes sense in a way.

44:13.000 --> 44:27.000
trust that has a long history with a technological mechanism, which which makes sense in a way, but trust in social relations, like I learned that from Nicholas Luman, I think is a is a mechanism to reduce complexity.

44:27.000 --> 44:39.000
And once you remove that social mechanism, you set free a lot of potential complexity to deal with on a technological level, because you can abstract all that away.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
If you just trust the person, you know, I have right now I have a babysitter at home.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
I trust her to bring my kid to sleep at around now, probably seven or seven thirty.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
I could also set up a smart contract with her.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
You know, if the baby monitor says you're not down at seven thirty, you're not getting paid.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
But is that really better?

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
And or does it just so much possible complexity emerges out of this?

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
Because maybe she has a good reason not to put it down at seven thirty, but maybe at seven forty.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
And then the smart contract would not work.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
And then we have to fix it afterwards.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
And so much complexity that I can just abstract away by just trusting that person.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
She's a good person. She will do a good job.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
And lots of social relationships work this way by trust.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
And we have to be very careful which ones we want to replace and which ones we want to keep.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
I think that works perfectly fine in the babysitter use case.

45:32.000 --> 45:44.000
But in the use case where you want to build something global platform or kind of potentially something with millions of people involved,

45:44.000 --> 45:57.000
I think it simply doesn't work that there are those personal trust relationships that make the whole thing work together.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Or at least there will come clear limitations.

46:00.000 --> 46:11.000
And just a very practical example where I very much value this trustlessness is in Ethereum.

46:11.000 --> 46:22.000
There are all those different projects that build pieces, kind of Lego pieces that you can then build more complex applications together.

46:22.000 --> 46:32.000
And it very much makes for us a difference whether one piece has something like an operator and kind of someone who could change the rules

46:32.000 --> 46:40.000
and where we would need to trust them and kind of need to make sure that they will not change it in a way we don't like it.

46:40.000 --> 46:47.000
And then kind of the whole thing we are building has a problem because one piece here is now acting in a different way.

46:47.000 --> 46:56.000
Or a piece with no operator, with no way to change it, what we would call trustless.

46:56.000 --> 47:09.000
And if you have those trustless puzzle pieces, the hope is that it allows you to build much more robust and complex systems.

47:10.000 --> 47:17.000
Many times I find myself actually really very much agreeing with the definition of the problem.

47:17.000 --> 47:24.000
You know, also when I read Glenn Whale and Vitalik Buterin some text about the radical markets,

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
I really, really, really, really do not agree with the solutions that they provide.

47:28.000 --> 47:36.000
But when they come to define the problems, they're actually quite clear on how to describe the ways in which

47:36.000 --> 47:46.000
contemporary structures, political structures are actually not, oftentimes not, any more convincing

47:46.000 --> 47:56.000
in the way they address the overall changing, I don't know, landscape of things, to be very unprecise.

47:56.000 --> 48:03.000
So there is this open question on how can we do things differently.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
There are many interesting problems that are being talked about in this space.

48:08.000 --> 48:14.000
And one of the questions would be in which case is the way that they are being approached from the

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
cryptoeconomics perspective, for example, is adequate and in which case it is not.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah, go ahead.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
Well, I don't want to, if you're going to kind of override the topic or something.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
I was trying to think what I would say next, so please go ahead.

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
No, just to say that, I don't know, for me, my work and interests is kind of like,

48:40.000 --> 48:48.000
I'm not so intensely focused on whether cryptoeconomics and blockchain are the solutions to things,

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
but I do think that they have done a lot to put the right questions on the table, right?

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
And to open up a lot more possibility for experimentation and especially in two areas,

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
especially when it comes to currencies and currency design and questions of value and money,

49:05.000 --> 49:13.000
at all scales, really, both in terms of global money, all the way down to local and this kind of thing,

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
and questions of privacy.

49:16.000 --> 49:23.000
And I think, you know, questions of privacy is something that unfortunately is like,

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
is kind of, to me, it seems like it's seeped a little bit into the background in recent kind of blockchain world.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
You know, like, okay, it turns out Bitcoin isn't anonymous.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
Okay, fine, you know, anonymity and privacy are slightly different things.

49:40.000 --> 49:49.000
But I think privacy is super interesting and super important in a kind of like increasingly digitally mediated world,

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
also in terms of questions of governance in the state, right?

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
So, you know, we no longer have like James Scott seeing like a state.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
There's no longer a kind of, it's not exactly a panopticon that we're living in anymore, is it?

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
It's a kind of different scenario, a kind of like algorithmic visibility that's a lot more nebulous,

50:06.000 --> 50:13.000
a lot more contingent, a lot harder to kind of like point your finger exactly at where the power is.

50:13.000 --> 50:21.000
And I think like the questions of kind of privacy within that and the kind of added building blocks

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
that blockchain technology promises in terms of currency design, governance structures and so on,

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
there are interesting ways then to kind of recreate, you know, how you want to organize as a community

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
in different levels and in different kind of scales.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
And I don't see this as like in any way a kind of absolute thing.

50:38.000 --> 50:46.000
It's not like replacing the state with something else because we actually live in a super complex patchwork of sovereignty already.

50:46.000 --> 50:56.000
I was reading a really interesting paper earlier today on water governance and indigenous sovereignty in the states versus the kind of federal.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
And there's a kind of coexistence, right?

50:59.000 --> 51:11.000
And that coexistence is not just like, you know, Native Americans are doing the same thing as kind of federal government.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
It's like they're doing things very, very differently, but they're governing water.

51:15.000 --> 51:24.000
Do you know what I mean? So it's like these qualitatively, like qualitatively different ways of doing things and the ability to determine that.

51:24.000 --> 51:31.000
Yeah, just like one note on the privacy question, blockchain really brings both ends of the spectrum.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, exactly.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
It brings the full kind of everything is verifiable, everything is visible, every transaction is.

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
But it also has a spectrum and to me still totally unclear kind of where we will end.

51:44.000 --> 51:51.000
It also brings the other spectrum and that's more recent developments with zero knowledge proofs,

51:51.000 --> 52:02.000
or whatever technology that really allows you or plausibly could allow you a total anonymity and and and no.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
And like you could do things, text evasion would be super easy.

52:07.000 --> 52:18.000
You could you could do you could also have pay or incentivize specific behavior and no one would kind of.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
There's quite a bit of scary things that are possible on that end of the spectrum.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
I don't know where we will end.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Can I ask a blunt question to you as experts?

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
Because I think we can all agree that crypto is a challenge for state actors.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
But is it a challenge for capitalism?

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
Would you think that the or is that maybe you as a practitioner also,

52:44.000 --> 52:51.000
is that something you would like working towards like a post capitalist form of economy that should be based on a blockchain?

52:51.000 --> 52:59.000
Or is it rather like this is just the next level of radical free market capitalism getting rid of all state actors and it's just money?

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
It's it's such a that is such an interesting question,

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
I mean, in the sense that I've had this question on my mind like for the longest time.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
And it was one of my motivations to write my PhD also was trying to work that out.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
And I still haven't worked it out. And I think there's something.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Yeah, I still have. I haven't worked it out.

53:16.000 --> 53:24.000
You know, I have I have to admit, like in many ways, like there is a lot to be said for the way that, you know,

53:24.000 --> 53:32.000
blockchain systems and Bitcoin and whatever kind of propagates a kind of like hyper capitalist mentality and approach to the world.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
Like, absolutely, you know, you can see that. But is that the full story?

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Like, no, no, to me, it's absolutely not the full story.

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
I think there's all kinds of weird mutations happening and even, you know, possible alternatives.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
But, you know, if you if you want to go deep into whether post capitalism is possible through blockchain,

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
I mean, like that goes that requires like some real deep soul searching around the entire technology industry,

53:57.000 --> 54:06.000
really, because the entire technology industry is deeply embedded and dependent on capitalist modes of organizing production and reproduction.

54:06.000 --> 54:16.000
You know, but there is some I do find it because you mentioned radical markets and they call themselves post capitalist,

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
which I just find so interesting because it's like, you know, kind of that for many people,

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
the kind of market approach to the world is like quintessentially.

54:25.000 --> 54:36.000
That's like that is, you know, one answer would be to maybe hyper capitalism is then post capitalism because I'm trying to find one thought.

54:37.000 --> 54:49.000
So I would say, yeah, of course, markets are a big thing in blockchain, but also different forms of tokens or of value.

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
So I guess one critique of I mean, of course, we wouldn't first need to define capitalism,

54:54.000 --> 55:04.000
but I guess one broad critique about capitalism and what people don't like about capitalism is kind of the reduction on one number kind of money.

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
But if we have multidimensional money, we just don't have like euros,

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
but kind of 100 different forms of tokens that represent different things or different different things.

55:16.000 --> 55:24.000
We value different relationships and different people can, well, optimize for different different values.

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
Well, you could call that hyper capitalism because you kind of have market mechanism for even more things.

55:30.000 --> 55:40.000
But maybe then it doesn't feel like capitalism anymore because it's not just a reduction on one number, but on 100 numbers or something like that.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I mean, there's so much to be said about that, right?

55:45.000 --> 55:56.000
It's like, oh, that would open up actually a big topic, but maybe we will come there in the discussion with the audience.

55:56.000 --> 56:03.000
I think one of the takeaways is that and that's something I learned from Benjamin's fantastic book,

56:03.000 --> 56:09.000
which I can only recommend highly is that it's a political question.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Actually, I learned it from your dissertation as well.

56:11.000 --> 56:17.000
So it does indeed open up new realms of possibilities, I guess.

56:17.000 --> 56:23.000
But it's very important that we ask ourselves which of those we want to choose.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Mm hmm.
