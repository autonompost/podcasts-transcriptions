0	1800	Welcome to Huge Histories.
1800	5000	My name is Jan Groos, and it is my great pleasure
5000	8080	to welcome Robin Hannell in today's episode.
8080	11840	He is professor of economics at Portland State University,
11840	13740	and together with Michael Albert,
13740	18000	he developed Paracon, short for participatory economics,
18000	20400	which is one of the most popular models
20400	23080	for democratic economic planning there is,
23080	27040	and it has been around for more than 30 years now.
27040	31240	I really wanted to cover Paracon as thoroughly as possible,
31240	34160	leading to more than four hours of material
34160	36880	of which you will hear roughly the first half
36880	37720	in this episode.
37720	41760	The second part will be released in two weeks.
41760	43480	And just to give you some orientation,
43480	46360	we begin by going through the model bit by bit,
46360	49280	and I kind of spared my critical questions
49280	53360	for after the model has been laid out in full.
53360	56440	This conversation is part of a small series
56440	58840	in which I cover some of the classical models
58840	60600	of democratic economic planning
60600	62960	by talking to their creators.
62960	65920	I already did an interview with David Leibman
65920	69040	on multi-level democratic iterative coordination
69040	71960	in episode 19 of season two,
71960	74320	and soon there will be a double episode
74320	76660	with Pat Devine as well.
76660	78880	Since all of these episodes are in English,
78880	80960	and since there are quite a couple
80960	84080	of other Future Histories episodes in English by now,
84080	87000	we created an English episode only feed
87000	88840	that you can subscribe to.
88840	90480	So if you don't speak German
90480	93720	and you are simply waiting
93720	95880	for the next English episode of Future Histories,
95880	99240	please go ahead and take a look at the show notes
99240	103520	where you will find a link to the English only RSS feed
103520	107160	as well as the newly created English version
107160	108560	of the homepage.
108560	111320	Please share among your English speaking friends.
111320	114000	I'm always very grateful for propaganda.
114880	115720	This is really very helpful
115720	120480	and maybe share in all of your different networks too.
120480	121480	Thank you so much.
121480	126120	And speaking of thanks, thank you Bernhard, Fabian
126120	128440	and Wilfried for their kind donations.
128440	132400	And there's a special kind of Patreon support that happened.
132400	135520	Happy birthday to Daniel from Malte
135520	137960	who became a Patreon supporter of Future Histories
137960	140160	as a birthday gift to Daniel.
140160	142360	And this is very heartwarming to me.
142360	145640	And I feel honored that this was gifted.
145640	149240	So double thanks to Malte and Daniel.
149240	152040	But now please enjoy today's episode
152040	155320	and in-depth interview with Robin Hanell
155320	157880	on participatory economics.
163400	165240	Welcome Robin.
165240	166600	Good to be with you.
166600	168040	It's a pleasure.
168040	171000	We will hopefully get into quite some detail
171000	172280	about Perikan today,
172280	175640	but let's start with an overview and broad definition.
175640	177080	What is Perikan?
178040	183040	It's an attempt to say something concrete
183040	187040	about what it is that we think that socialists
188440	191640	should be proposing as the kind of economic system
192960	196720	that we wanna replace capitalism with in the 21st century.
197720	201920	In the light of all of the experiences
201920	205720	with different attempts to create a socialist economy
205720	208480	in the 20th century, what lessons have we learned
208480	212320	and what should we now be proposing?
212320	214960	It's our proposal of what we left us
214960	216600	who wanna replace capitalism
216600	218360	with a far better economic system,
218360	222440	a kind of socialism that's very democratic
222440	225240	and that encourages popular participation.
227720	232480	And the other thing is that we thought that for too long,
232480	236920	anti-capitalists have just been very vague
236920	241920	about what it is they want in light of the Soviet experience
242320	244800	in the Eastern European countries and Cuba.
246480	251320	In light of all that, we felt like reasonable people
251320	254160	would expect, you have to say something
254200	257440	a little more concrete than just your values
257440	260400	and your wishes for how the economy should work.
261520	264000	So we thought, well, let's begin that process
264000	267240	by making some very, very concrete proposals
267240	269240	about how all the different kinds of decisions
269240	271680	that have to be made, how they might best be made,
271680	273480	and then we can all talk about it.
273480	277040	So that was the motivation, that was the purpose
277040	279040	for putting something out there.
279040	281400	And then we had to discuss what label to put on it,
281400	283000	and we ended up with, well, let's call it
283040	285520	a participatory economy.
285520	287420	So that was the origins.
288640	292000	Michael and I were very much together on that wavelength
292000	297000	and the first books we published about it were back in 1990.
297640	300120	So at this point, it's been around a while.
302640	305360	And after the fall of the wall
306600	309720	and the sort of crumbling of the centrally planned economies
309720	311840	in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
311840	316000	there's now been a 30-year debate
316000	318440	about what should socialists be championing.
318440	321460	And there's various schools of thought.
321460	324580	There's a lot of proposals about market socialism.
325680	328840	There's basically proposals about taking
328840	332540	social democratic capitalism as far as you can take it.
332540	334180	I would call that's Alec Nove.
335660	338320	And then there are other people who have continued to say,
338320	340560	no, we want a lot more planning than that.
340560	344560	Market socialism isn't really what we socialists
344560	346360	should be championing in the future.
347200	349480	We really need to talk seriously about planning
349480	351560	and different forms of planning.
351560	356560	So this proposal is one of the proposals that's out there
356920	360920	that sort of fits into that 30-year debate.
360920	363800	And in that context, it's been argued about
363800	366120	in various journals and at various conferences
366120	368100	over the past 30 years.
368100	372060	And there are some basic principles that inform pericon.
372060	374620	And these are in short, self-governance
374620	377700	through democratic councils of workers and consumers
377700	379460	and their respective federations.
379460	380620	That's the first one.
380620	383780	The second one would be jobs balanced for empowerment,
383780	386460	desirability and caring labor.
386460	390260	The third one would be remuneration according to sacrifice
390260	392660	or effort as judged by coworkers.
392660	395980	And the fourth one would be economic coordination
395980	398980	through a participatory planning procedure.
398980	401860	I would very much like to go through all of them.
401860	404180	Let's start with self-governance.
404180	406700	How would democratic self-governance
406700	408740	be achieved in pericon?
408740	410740	You did a brilliant job of summarizing
410740	412400	the major features of the proposal,
412400	414500	so I don't have to, thank you.
414500	419500	First, we've argued that it's very clear
419940	423660	that it's very important to think very hard
423660	427040	about exactly what you think economic democracy means.
429180	432140	And there's two different views
432140	435260	about what economic democracy means
435260	436900	that are really dominant.
436900	440140	One is, well, it's like politics.
440140	444160	I mean, democratic politics is everybody gets a vote.
444160	447500	Everybody gets a vote and everybody gets the same vote.
447500	449200	How else can you do this?
449200	452220	In economics, there's also this concept
452220	453780	that's been around for a long time
453780	456580	that right-wingers like Milton Friedman
456580	458060	called economic freedom.
459520	462420	And that is, well, I should be free to do
462420	466100	with my person and property whatever I want.
466100	468760	And we want a system that allows people to do that.
469780	474180	And so we have begun, we try to begin the discussion
474180	477420	by pointing out that both of these approaches
477420	481940	to what economic democracy or economic freedom means,
481940	486180	they don't apply in most situations
487340	491180	because particularly when economic decisions are made,
491180	495480	what will happen is any economic decision you look at
495480	497820	will affect some people more than other people.
499120	502380	So one person, one vote works
502380	505940	as a notion of economic democracy in those cases
505940	508320	where everybody is affected more or less equally
508320	509260	by the decision.
510260	514020	And economic freedom works for decisions
514020	515420	that really only affect me.
515420	518900	I mean, what color underwear should I put on today?
518900	521700	So yeah, of course, we want economic freedom
521700	523440	is the right way to make that decision.
523440	525880	I get to decide, nobody gets to tell me that.
528100	532020	On the other hand, most economic decisions
532020	534940	are decisions where some people will be affected,
535900	538140	more than one person will be affected,
538140	540860	but some people will be affected more than others.
540860	542980	So we have begun by saying,
542980	545800	let's be clear what the goal is here.
545800	549280	The goal is we want to design procedures
549280	550860	for making economic decisions
550860	554340	so that people would approximately have influence
554340	557900	over a decision to the degree that they are affected.
559260	563780	And that's sort of, that's our starting point
563780	566340	in terms of how we go about thinking
566340	568780	about what a democratic economy means.
568780	570980	And we call that self-management.
570980	573900	We define self-management as decision-making input
573900	576660	over things to the degree that you're affected.
576660	578580	And in some cases, that means I'll have more
578580	580500	decision-making authority or input
580500	581980	than somebody else does.
581980	584860	And in some cases, it'll mean I have some input,
584860	587500	but I don't have as much input as other people.
587500	590720	And in the particular context of workplaces,
590720	595660	what a workplace produces and what technologies they use
595700	599260	and how they go about organizing their work process,
599260	601560	clearly those decisions affect people
601560	604920	in what we propose to be a worker's council,
606540	609520	far more than they affect all sorts of other people.
609520	610980	But it's not that,
610980	614540	their decisions clearly affect other people as well.
614540	618300	What they decide to produce is going to affect consumers.
618300	622060	And if they use these inputs rather than those inputs,
622060	627060	it means, well, if they use particular parts of land,
629300	631020	if they use a piece of land,
631020	633660	that means somebody else can't use it.
633660	634940	So we start with that.
634940	636680	We start with that.
636680	640620	You mentioned that we also start with sort of a position
640620	643380	about, well, what would be a fair way
643380	647180	to distribute the burdens and benefits of economic activity?
647180	650760	And this is something that's hotly contested
650760	653560	by socialists and has been for,
653560	655560	since socialism first became
655560	658480	some sort of an ideology in a movement.
658480	662320	What is a fair, just how should workers be rewarded?
662320	665260	On what basis should people be rewarded?
665260	669020	And we've argued that when you go through all of that,
669020	670960	and you think it through clearly,
670960	673760	that a desirable economy would be one
673760	676760	in which workers are rewarded according
676760	679260	to the sacrifices they make when they work.
680180	681760	We've also used the word effort.
681760	683980	Sometimes some people, I mean,
683980	686780	I know there are times when I'm working harder.
686780	690100	I know when there are times when I'm working less hard.
690100	692500	And those who work harder
692500	694740	probably deserve more compensation.
696300	698340	And certainly people who work,
698340	700420	who make greater sacrifices than they work.
700420	702540	I mean, neoclassical economists
702540	704380	call it the disutility of labor.
705420	707420	You're working right now,
707420	709500	but your disutility isn't very high.
709500	712140	You're doing something that you find more,
712140	714100	you're doing something you find more or less pleasant.
714100	717680	The coal miner who goes down a shaft
717680	721300	and exposes themselves to coal dust
721300	725860	and is sweating and coming home sore at the end of the day
725860	729900	is making more sacrifices than somebody who,
729900	731420	somebody like you or me is
731420	733840	during most of the time when we're working.
733840	736860	So we just think those things should be taken into account.
736900	738340	Those are legitimate reasons
738340	742140	for why some people should sometimes be compensated
742140	743420	by more than others.
743420	747060	Now, how you go about doing that.
747060	749900	So how you go about arranging for economic decisions
749900	751940	to be made according to this principle
751940	755660	or goal of self-management
755660	759340	and how it is that you arrange for people to be compensated
759340	760820	according to their sacrifice.
760820	763180	Well, but at least we understand
763180	765540	what we're trying to accomplish.
765700	768460	And we were very self-conscious from the very beginning
768460	770820	and coming up with proposals
770820	773520	for how you would actually achieve those goals.
774460	776500	Now, one thing I'll be very honest about,
776500	779780	we did not think about very much back in 1990
779780	781820	was environmental sustainability.
783860	785860	So I will plead guilty
785860	788940	as long as most of my socialist comrades of my age
788940	791460	are willing to plead guilty along with me
791460	794620	because we really should.
796540	799940	Leftists and socialists, I believe,
799940	804300	where Johnny come lately to environmental awareness.
804300	805740	We were just so concerned
805740	807540	with all sorts of other things we cared about.
807540	811360	Oh, economic self-management and economic justice
811360	815220	that we sort of took environmental things for granted.
815220	818320	And in many ways, we're just like everybody else
818320	820700	in terms of being woefully un-woke
820700	823700	on the subject of what was happening with the environment.
823700	827700	But one of the things I'm really proud of is,
827700	832300	and this was, I will give my wife credit for this.
833300	836460	My wife is an environmental economist
836460	840320	and she brought her leftist husband
840320	844040	to awareness about just how negligent
844040	845820	me and my fellow comrades were
845820	848440	in our thinking about environmental issues.
848440	852580	And now I have become, as a professional economist,
852580	855260	I teach political economy, I teach economic theory,
855260	856900	but for more than 20 years,
856900	859760	I've also taught environmental economics.
859760	863700	I can almost prove my point about negligence on the left.
863700	865780	So I taught in an economics department
865780	867460	at American University,
867460	871740	known as sort of a heterodox school of economics,
871740	874580	a PhD program that studied political economy
874580	879000	as well as mainstream economics.
879000	881840	We didn't have a professor, you know,
881840	884680	who was a specialist in environmental economics
884680	888060	for the first 15 years I taught in that program.
889160	892240	And I became an environmental economist
892240	893920	because somebody had raised their hand
893920	894920	and said, who's gonna teach
894920	896560	the environmental economics class?
896560	898920	And I said, you know, okay, so I'll do that.
898920	900760	So that's how I became somebody
900760	903740	who actually learned enough about environmental economics
903740	908740	to realize that you have clearly in the year 2020,
909340	913940	clearly any economy to be desirable
913940	917940	has to be an economy that's designed in ways
917940	919860	that is going to help us protect
919860	921900	and preserve the natural environment
923660	925580	far better than any economic system
925580	927540	that people have used up until now.
927540	930820	So I very self-consciously now add the goal
930820	933060	of environmental sustainability, you know,
933060	935660	to economic democracy and economic justice.
936620	940460	And we will get to the mechanisms
940460	943300	that have been incorporated into Perrican
943300	945980	in order to address this question.
945980	950700	Before we go there, maybe you could like guide the audience
950700	953540	through this basic setup of institutions within Perrican.
953540	955740	So this is sort of a thumbnail sketch
955740	959600	of what the major features of a participatory economy are.
961060	962420	We propose that,
963180	966880	that the first is workers councils.
967820	970300	So we don't have private corporations.
972020	974940	Workplaces are governed by a workers council
974940	976540	where every worker has one vote.
976540	980400	And we can go back to our suggestions or proposals
980400	983320	for how it is that workers councils might want to proceed
983320	986640	in their own process of self-governance.
986640	988960	But we have workers councils.
988960	992020	We also have proposed that consumers,
992820	994540	that consumers be organized
994540	997220	into what we call neighborhood consumer councils.
998160	1002620	Because we want to enfranchise consumers
1002620	1005060	in our planning processes.
1005060	1006780	And if they act as individuals,
1006780	1010020	it's very difficult for us to incorporate them
1010020	1011340	into planning procedures.
1011340	1013780	But if we simply say
1013780	1018020	that we organize neighborhood consumption councils
1018020	1020620	where we're talking about maybe 5,000
1020620	1023740	or 6,000 families that are living in a neighborhood.
1023740	1027000	So these are geographically defined neighborhoods.
1027000	1029940	And we just want the size of the council to be such
1029940	1033020	that you could reasonably participate
1033020	1035940	by going to meetings in your neighborhood
1035940	1037460	consumption council.
1037460	1041100	So that's another sort of major institutional proposal
1041100	1042500	that we have.
1042500	1044500	It's a way, we think it's important
1044500	1048580	to enfranchise consumers in planning procedures
1048620	1051420	along with workers in their workplace.
1051420	1054700	What's probably most innovative about our proposal,
1054700	1059260	I believe, is that there's two different ways
1059260	1063180	that people have thought you could integrate
1063180	1064820	the interrelated activities
1064820	1067360	of hundreds of thousands of workers councils
1067360	1069980	and hundreds of thousands of consumer councils.
1069980	1072180	And one would be simply through the market.
1073500	1076760	Because consumers have to buy what workers,
1076760	1080360	consumers have to get what workers councils are producing
1080360	1084360	and different workers councils have to receive inputs.
1084360	1087440	So there is a, you have to coordinate all this.
1088420	1092240	And the two ways that the dominant thinking
1092240	1094620	about how to coordinate all this is,
1094620	1096440	well, you either have to coordinate it
1096440	1098640	through market exchanges,
1098640	1102460	or you're gonna need some sort of central agency
1102460	1104640	that gathers all the information
1105600	1108000	and then puts together a coherent plan
1108000	1109600	for how all this could work out.
1110680	1115680	And what we have said is both of those are a disaster
1115880	1120880	that we now can foreseeably predict sort of some,
1122920	1127920	at least with the, I mean, hindsight's perfect,
1127980	1132000	but we have the 20th century of hindsight
1132000	1134720	to see what happened when socialists tried
1134720	1138960	to somehow have a central planning agency,
1138960	1141640	be in charge of this coordinating process.
1141640	1143560	And it's not a good outcome.
1143560	1146260	And then the question is, but is there an alternative?
1147220	1151360	And our answer was, there is an alternative.
1151360	1155180	And what's I think particularly interesting about it is,
1155180	1160080	I think the alternative is exactly what early socialists
1160120	1163160	always thought would go on if you go back
1163160	1166520	to the late 1900s and early 20th century.
1166520	1170000	What they always thought was, well, these workers councils,
1170000	1173720	of course they have, their activities are interrelated.
1173720	1176840	They're gonna have to plan together
1176840	1178700	how that interrelation works out.
1179720	1184720	And so we very self-consciously tried to design procedures
1186600	1189600	that would essentially take that view
1189600	1191440	of what it is we're attempting to do.
1192480	1195880	Is there some way that we could have workers councils
1195880	1198000	proposing what they wanna do,
1198000	1201760	consumer councils saying, this is what we wanna consume?
1201760	1204640	And is there some way that they could make
1204640	1208160	what I call sort of self-activity proposals
1208160	1213160	and then discover what the consequences of that are,
1213300	1216600	and then go back to the drawing board
1216600	1220440	and revise the proposals and resubmit them
1220440	1224520	so that we could find a feasible plan in this way.
1224520	1226800	And we wouldn't have a central planning agency
1226800	1228440	sitting on top of everybody saying,
1228440	1230080	well, what you propose doesn't work,
1230080	1231620	you're gonna have to do this.
1232720	1237720	And we wouldn't have market forces driving the outcome.
1240920	1241960	Is there really any reason
1241960	1244360	that we couldn't do things that way?
1244360	1247620	So we've worked on it sort of theoretically,
1249160	1252200	and now we've worked on it with sort of computer simulations
1252200	1254640	to see whether something that we can prove
1254640	1257300	under certain assumptions would reach a feasible
1257300	1260260	and desirable and efficient plan under.
1261440	1263200	This is what economists do.
1263200	1266080	We say, well, if you make certain assumptions
1266080	1267760	about preferences people have,
1267760	1270360	if you make certain assumptions about technologies
1270600	1275000	that producers have, then under those assumptions,
1275000	1276640	you can prove that some procedure
1276640	1279160	will reach a particular outcome.
1279160	1283600	And way back in 1990, we essentially said
1283600	1286440	under far less rigorous assumptions
1286440	1289800	than you need to prove that a market capitalist economy
1289800	1292120	will reach an efficient outcome.
1292120	1293960	We can say this process,
1293960	1296520	which we think was what early socialists
1296680	1300760	and most people drawn to socialism always wanted instead.
1300760	1302640	This process will work out.
1302640	1304840	This process could, it works in theory.
1306980	1311460	Now that left the issue of, but is it practical?
1312400	1313600	And we'll come back to this,
1313600	1316780	but I mean here to put the issue very, very bluntly.
1317760	1320960	Well, in theory, if we still have,
1320960	1323680	if we allow the workers and the consumer neighborhood
1323680	1326060	consumer councils to keep making proposals
1326620	1329380	and revising their proposals enough times,
1329380	1331540	in theory, we'll come to a feasible plan
1331540	1333100	that we can start the year with.
1334380	1338180	But what if it takes 1000 revisions?
1338180	1340560	Well, then it becomes a practical impossibility.
1340560	1343700	So that question was left aside until,
1343700	1345060	I mean, the best way to answer it
1345060	1347960	is to convince some country they wanna try it.
1347960	1350860	But until that happens, then the only answer is
1350860	1352960	you try and do some computer simulations
1352960	1353900	to see what happens.
1353900	1355580	And we now basically have done that
1356100	1359020	and we have some, I think some pretty interesting,
1359020	1361460	at least preliminary reporting
1361460	1363260	that we can do on that subject.
1363260	1366300	Besides the workers councils that are self-managed,
1366300	1369500	the consumer councils that are also sort of self-governing
1369500	1371880	and participate in the planning procedure,
1372860	1375220	our specific proposal for how it is
1375220	1379180	that annual participatory planning can substitute
1379180	1382700	for a central planning board and markets
1382700	1384140	as a way to come up with a plan.
1384140	1389140	I think that's the sort of unique and it is unique.
1390260	1392100	And I think it's a very central part
1392100	1393780	of what our overall proposal is.
1395060	1398540	And maybe just for the audience
1398540	1401060	in order to give some orientation,
1401060	1404620	the mechanism that is an essential part
1404620	1407860	of this participatory planning procedure
1407860	1410900	that will take up all of this information
1410900	1414460	and process it in a way in order to provide
1414460	1418100	some first estimates on how to proceed.
1418100	1421500	This institution is called the IFB,
1421500	1425860	the Iteration Facilitation Board, isn't it?
1425860	1430540	Yes, you know, when you're creating things
1430540	1432300	and you have to put names on them,
1433460	1438460	some choices are felicitous and some are less so.
1438900	1443580	And Michael Albert and I remember we talked for,
1443580	1445780	I mean, we had long conversations
1445780	1450780	about what name do we wanna give to this system or proposal?
1451280	1455260	And I mean, I remember one of the early ones we thought of
1455260	1457980	was decentralized socialist planning.
1459920	1464700	And I'm the economist and Michael's the political activist.
1464700	1466960	So that appealed to me.
1468820	1470980	And Michael argued in this time,
1470980	1474220	I mean, we've had various arguments over the decades
1474220	1475860	and sometimes I think I've been right
1475860	1477540	and sometimes I think he was right.
1477540	1479540	And on this one, he was dead right.
1479540	1481420	He said, you know what?
1481420	1485940	I mean, we should call it a participatory economy.
1485940	1488940	If people wanna call it participatory socialism, that's fine.
1488940	1492020	If people wanna say, well, how does it fit in
1492020	1494420	to left ideology?
1494420	1497940	We can say it's libertarian socialism.
1498820	1502380	In Europe calling something libertarian socialism,
1502380	1505060	it works because everybody knows what you mean.
1505060	1508340	In the United States, that's a huge problem
1508340	1512580	because the only people who call themselves libertarians
1512580	1515620	in the United States are right-wing libertarians.
1515620	1518140	So if you say libertarian socialism,
1518140	1521900	you mostly just confuse people in the United States.
1521900	1523380	But in any case, we had to come up
1523420	1525220	with some sort of a name and he was the one
1525220	1527020	that was just very insistent.
1527020	1531700	We really decentralized socialist planning, no, no, no.
1531700	1534900	We should just call it a participatory economy.
1534900	1536340	I think he was right about that.
1536340	1538300	The iteration facilitation board
1538300	1540120	is a very unfortunate name.
1541380	1543380	And in anarchist circles,
1543380	1548380	it's also a very hotly contested issue exactly what it is.
1549220	1553500	So besides the name being unfortunate, it's clunky.
1555060	1558460	The real issue is, well, what does it do?
1558460	1561400	And I'll just go straight to the issue here.
1562820	1566260	Anarchists are suspicious
1567800	1570100	that it's just a different name
1570100	1572500	for the central planning bureau,
1572500	1575160	that it's a central planning bureau in disguise.
1576000	1580240	You told us you didn't have a central planning bureau.
1580240	1583400	You told us that this was an alternative
1583400	1584880	to central planning,
1584880	1587020	but you really just sort of hoodwinked us.
1587020	1589160	You gave it a different name,
1589160	1593320	but it really is doing what central planning bureaus do.
1595680	1600160	And so I wanna take care of that immediately.
1601280	1603120	This thing, whatever you call it,
1603960	1605360	we haven't got a better name yet,
1605360	1607220	iteration facilitation board.
1607220	1608920	This is what it does.
1608920	1612400	At the beginning of the annual planning process,
1612400	1617160	it announces whatever the current estimates are
1617160	1620920	of the opportunity costs of using different resources,
1620920	1624140	the opportunity cost of using different kinds of labor,
1625120	1627920	the opportunity cost of using machinery,
1627920	1630340	stocks of machines that we have,
1630340	1634580	and whatever estimates the current estimates are
1634580	1637160	of the social cost of producing different things.
1638100	1639460	So for an economist,
1639460	1643440	what it does is it announces an initial price vector.
1644780	1647860	Now in left circles, I don't wanna use the word price
1647860	1650100	because as soon as you talk about a price,
1650100	1652400	somebody thinks there's a market.
1652400	1654460	As a matter of fact, as soon as you talk about a price,
1654460	1657400	some people don't even wanna talk to you.
1657440	1661720	On the other hand, as an economist, I can insist,
1661720	1664220	well, in order to make a sensible proposal
1664220	1667220	about what our workplace wants to do,
1667220	1670360	we have to have some idea of what does it cost society
1670360	1673760	to use different things we're asking permission to use,
1673760	1675060	different inputs.
1675060	1676880	And we have to have some sort of idea
1676880	1680960	of whether or not consumers would rather have shoes
1681960	1683580	or shirts.
1683580	1686760	So you can't make a sensible proposal
1686760	1689480	without some sort of information along those lines.
1689480	1692560	So this is what the iteration facilitation board does
1692560	1694480	in our annual planning process.
1694480	1699480	It announces some initial estimates of what those are.
1701620	1706460	Now in our simulations for the first year,
1706460	1710320	we said it's just gonna have to announce something arbitrary.
1712780	1715980	But in the real world, of course, what it would do is
1715980	1720740	it would begin, it would have a much better initial estimate
1720740	1723220	to offer than just an arbitrary answer
1723220	1724820	to what those things are.
1724820	1727320	It could take whatever they were from last year
1727320	1729740	and say, let's start with those.
1730580	1733580	So in either case, and I can tell you something
1733580	1735140	about when we did the simulations,
1735140	1737340	how much difference it makes.
1737340	1738900	You know, if you start from last year,
1738900	1741960	take advantage of some information you already have
1741960	1744420	instead of assuming you have no information.
1744420	1746620	But anyway, they make the announcement.
1748300	1751780	At that point, all of the workers councils respond
1751780	1754860	with what I call a self-activity proposal.
1754860	1757660	We wanna produce this much of these different outputs
1757660	1760660	and we want permission to use all these different inputs
1760660	1761800	in order to do that.
1763220	1766320	The neighborhood consumer councils submit
1766320	1769020	on behalf of everybody in the neighborhood.
1769020	1771520	So the neighborhood consumer council is gonna have
1771520	1775880	to approve individual consumption requests.
1775880	1777240	And we can come back to whether or not
1777240	1779700	that's an intrusive process or not.
1779700	1783000	But in any case, people don't participate
1783000	1787240	in annual planning as individual consumers.
1788600	1791740	It's the neighborhood council that participates.
1791740	1795640	So it sends in, it says, this is the sum total
1795640	1798480	of all the approved consumption requests
1798480	1800640	of the people living in the neighborhood.
1800640	1805640	And this is the sum total income that all those people have.
1806200	1807680	And that income can either come,
1807680	1810160	it's either income because they worked
1810160	1812440	and their sacrifice effort ratings gave them
1812440	1815720	that much income or we're gonna, I mean,
1815720	1818280	obviously you're gonna have social security payments
1818280	1819880	and disability payments.
1821280	1824120	You're gonna have need-based payments.
1824120	1827040	So all that income basically,
1827040	1831240	and so the consumer council responds to
1831240	1832960	how much are the consumers,
1832960	1835880	what's the social cost of making different things?
1835880	1837720	Responds to that by saying,
1837720	1840080	here's what the neighborhood consumption council
1840080	1842760	wants to consume, we've approved,
1842760	1846720	and here is the total income that we all have.
1848320	1852200	When those come in, supplies and demands
1852200	1854140	for everything will not be equal.
1855140	1859580	So there'll be, when all those proposals come in,
1859580	1862420	there'll be excess demand for a whole bunch of things,
1862420	1864100	and there may be excess supply,
1864100	1866060	offers to supply or availability,
1866060	1868940	not everything is being used of something.
1868940	1872380	All the iteration facilitation board does
1872380	1877100	is adjust its estimates of any price
1877100	1880580	where there was excess demand, it adjusts the estimate up.
1881500	1885540	And if it's excess supply, they adjust the estimate down.
1885540	1887060	That's all they do.
1887060	1890780	So, I mean, that has been my answer to the anarchists who,
1890780	1894100	look, given the history of socialism,
1894100	1897260	it's very sensible to be paranoid
1897260	1900180	about whether anything called an agency
1900180	1901900	in charge of a planned economy
1901900	1903620	is gonna turn into one of those evil
1903620	1905420	central planning agencies.
1905420	1910420	So I applaud the fact that somebody really wants to,
1910820	1913940	that somebody wants to be very careful about that.
1913940	1918940	On the other hand, my answer is what authority
1918980	1922420	did this agency exert?
1922420	1924140	What decisions did they make?
1925020	1928420	They didn't tell anybody what they had to propose.
1928420	1931380	They didn't say, your proposal is unaccepted.
1932620	1936300	They didn't say, well, your proposal doesn't fit
1936300	1937980	and we need a plan that's feasible,
1937980	1941460	we're gonna revise your proposal for you.
1941460	1943460	They don't do any of those things,
1943460	1946660	which is exactly what central planning agencies did.
1946660	1951380	All they do is adjust the estimates that they send out
1951380	1954980	for the next round of revisions and proposals.
1954980	1959980	They adjust the estimates to give us more accurate,
1962060	1965620	to basically give us more accurate estimates of social,
1965620	1968260	of opportunity costs of using things
1968260	1970260	and the social costs of producing things.
1970260	1973620	That's all the iteration facilitation board does.
1973620	1977460	And maybe you could dig a little deeper into the question
1977460	1979540	of how these indicative prices
1979540	1981460	are actually being calculated.
1981460	1985100	You state that they are basically estimates
1985100	1987180	of opportunity costs and social costs,
1987180	1990340	but how are these measured in concrete terms
1990340	1994340	and how does one measure opportunity costs,
1994340	1997140	which is foregone benefit basically,
1997140	2000020	for all goods and services if individual benefit
2000020	2004500	is actually a highly subjective and context specific
2004500	2006700	and also dynamic value.
2006700	2009100	And this is all additional to the question
2009100	2011020	whether or not individual benefit
2011020	2013540	is really the right measure to begin with.
2013540	2016660	So I was asking myself how this is being done
2016660	2018900	in very concrete terms,
2018900	2021300	maybe also for someone who's not an economist
2021300	2023980	and doesn't really know about the concept
2024620	2025700	of opportunity costs.
2025700	2029540	Okay, I'm gonna smile a little bit
2029540	2030860	and be a little facetious.
2030860	2035860	I mean, and so I'm gonna be a little facetious and say,
2040860	2045860	part of the brilliance is that it happens organically.
2049340	2053020	So there's two sort of ways you can think about
2053020	2055580	where do these estimates of opportunity
2055580	2057780	and social costs come from?
2057780	2059140	And one way of thinking about it,
2059140	2061740	which is the common sense way to think about it.
2061740	2063980	And it's the way most people do think about it.
2063980	2066460	And I think it's the way that most people approaching
2066460	2070180	socialism have always thought about it is,
2070180	2072140	well, somebody would have to sit down
2073060	2075180	and sort of try and calculate that
2076220	2079540	and take all sorts of factors into account
2079540	2081300	as part of their calculation.
2083860	2087420	And that's not what, that's not how it happens at all.
2088620	2090580	That's not how it happens at all.
2091620	2095900	Instead, I told you that the initial estimates
2095900	2097060	can be arbitrary.
2098300	2101700	And then I said, we start with initial estimates,
2103500	2106740	the workers councils and the consumer councils respond,
2107820	2110540	that gives us some excess demands and excess supplies
2110620	2113220	that tell us the plan isn't feasible yet.
2114180	2116780	We know to make the plan feasible,
2116780	2120540	the way to do it is to increase the estimate of things
2120540	2123260	that are in excess demand and decrease the estimate
2123260	2125380	of the things that are in excess supply.
2126340	2130860	An agency does that, but it's a mechanical thing.
2130860	2135860	It's not sitting down and trying to actually do some study
2135860	2137140	that leads to the answer.
2137140	2139900	Now, and the other reason I'm gonna smile and claim
2139900	2142540	there's a certain genius at work here was,
2142540	2146740	is well, but what we proved
2146740	2149220	and all the economists have had to acknowledge
2149220	2151780	is that, yeah, you did prove this,
2151780	2153860	is that under standard assumptions
2153860	2156180	about what people's preferences are like
2157900	2161060	and standard assumptions about what technologies are like,
2161060	2164300	the kinds of standard assumptions every economics has
2164300	2166980	to make in order to do any theoretical study
2166980	2168780	of what would happen in case.
2168780	2171740	Under standard assumptions, actually more lax
2171740	2175100	and there's some assumptions we don't even have to make
2176060	2179140	that are made to sort of do this kind of analysis
2179140	2180340	for a market system,
2181900	2185900	that this process will lead to two outcomes.
2185900	2188580	The first outcome is, and this is the one
2188580	2191540	that I would think is the most important,
2192020	2194420	and this is the one that I would think
2194420	2196740	is more important to us is,
2196740	2201020	the first outcome is it'll lead to a feasible plan
2201020	2204060	where everything that somebody's counting on,
2204060	2206700	I've been authorized to do this,
2206700	2208500	but that means I have to be,
2208500	2212140	I'm also authorized to receive this in order to do it,
2212140	2214740	that everybody will be able to actually carry out
2215740	2218860	the last thing that they proposed.
2219380	2220700	That's the first thing.
2220700	2224180	We've demonstrated that you'll get to a feasible plan.
2224180	2227940	We've also demonstrated that the plan will be efficient.
2227940	2230540	You won't be misusing resources.
2230540	2233700	You won't be using a resource to do something
2233700	2235940	where you're producing something less valuable,
2235940	2237940	whereas if you'd used it for something else,
2237940	2240420	it would have produced something that was more valuable.
2240420	2241820	More valuable to whom?
2241820	2243780	More valuable to consumers,
2243780	2246180	given what it is they're telling you they want
2246180	2247020	and they don't want.
2247300	2252300	The third thing is that your final estimates
2252340	2254620	of these opportunity and social costs
2255820	2258100	will be as accurate as any estimates
2258100	2263100	of social opportunity and social costs you can expect.
2263380	2267420	So it's not that non-economists approach this
2267420	2271820	in a very sensible, straightforward way.
2271820	2274940	While you're saying that we're not going to be able
2275020	2277380	to do that, while you're saying that we need
2277380	2280140	to know the opportunity cost of using a piece of land,
2281260	2282900	that's probably a hard thing
2282900	2284580	to figure out what that would be.
2286300	2287580	And if somebody were sitting down
2287580	2290700	and trying to calculate it, it would be hard.
2290700	2292700	Basically, it would be impossible.
2292700	2296820	But that doesn't mean that certain procedures
2298220	2300740	will not generate that information.
2301700	2303260	And that's what's happening.
2303260	2305300	It's not that somebody's calculating it,
2305300	2308820	it's that that answer is being generated.
2310260	2312620	And it's generated by the process I've described
2312620	2315100	as the annual participatory planning process.
2316020	2321020	And at some point, there will be a situation
2321820	2326820	where all of the councils will have to decide up on
2327340	2330060	whether or not the different proposals
2330060	2332020	are being accepted or not.
2332020	2334340	So maybe let's move a step further
2334340	2335700	within the planning process
2335700	2339300	so the audience can kind of understand the different steps.
2339300	2342860	So we reach the point where there will be a feasible plan,
2342860	2343980	as you call it.
2343980	2348980	So how are the next procedural steps then?
2349140	2352500	Yes, if there isn't a central planning agency
2352500	2357500	that says no, well, then who says no
2358900	2361700	if a worker council proposes to do some,
2361740	2364500	they're the only ones allowed to make proposals
2364500	2367420	and nobody gets to revise their proposals other than them.
2368340	2371780	So what's gonna prevent a worker council
2371780	2374580	from doing something that really isn't fair
2374580	2375620	to the rest of us?
2377340	2379660	And what's gonna prevent a consumer council
2380660	2383700	for doing something that isn't fair to the rest of us?
2383700	2385940	Let's first figure out, well, what would it mean
2385940	2388780	to do something that isn't fair to the rest of us?
2388780	2392460	For a worker council, what it comes down to is
2392460	2395460	you're making a proposal to produce certain outputs,
2395460	2397860	but you're also proposing that you would be allowed
2397860	2399340	to use certain inputs.
2400300	2402940	Well, those inputs have a cost to society
2402940	2405380	because if you use them, somebody else can't.
2405380	2407140	And those outputs are presumably
2407140	2408500	for some other worker council
2408500	2410100	that finds them more or less valuable
2410100	2412940	or for consumers who find them more or less valuable.
2414140	2416620	So there's sort of the social benefits
2416620	2420540	of all the outputs that you have proposed
2420540	2423140	and there's the social cost of all the inputs
2423140	2424660	that you've proposed.
2425940	2428340	An irresponsible proposal,
2428340	2430900	I'm gonna call it socially irresponsible.
2430900	2435020	It would be socially irresponsible for a worker council
2435020	2437860	to make a proposal where the social benefits
2437860	2440180	of their outputs aren't at least as large
2440180	2442700	as the social cost of their inputs.
2442700	2443660	Because if they do that,
2443660	2445260	the rest of us are gonna be worse off
2445260	2447860	if they go ahead and do what they're proposing.
2449900	2451700	What would it mean for a consumer council
2451700	2453060	to be irresponsible?
2453060	2457020	So for a worker's council, the real issue is,
2457020	2459340	are you gonna contribute more to social benefits
2459340	2461020	than you do to social costs?
2463300	2466900	And before I move on, let me point out,
2468420	2469980	as long as you're not,
2469980	2473100	as long as the social benefits of your proposal
2473140	2475220	are at least as large as the social costs,
2476140	2477780	the rest of us are not any worse off
2477780	2479100	if you go ahead and do it.
2481180	2483620	You're not making any of the rest of us worse off.
2484540	2487700	And so why would we care what you do?
2487700	2489780	As long as you don't make me,
2489780	2492780	as long as the rest of us are not made worse off,
2492780	2495140	go ahead and do whatever the hell you want to.
2497020	2499100	Now the consumer councils.
2499100	2501260	So the neighborhood consumer councils are saying,
2501260	2503020	we wanna consume all this stuff.
2503940	2506100	Well, it costs society a lot to make all this stuff.
2508060	2510900	Social responsibility for them amounts
2510900	2515020	to comparing their aggregate income,
2516060	2521060	that is their right to consume socially costly goods
2521660	2524980	and services to the social cost
2524980	2526500	of their consumption request.
2527500	2532260	So as long as the income, the sacrifices from work
2532300	2534580	and the allowances and disability and all,
2534580	2537500	as long as that is sufficient to pay for
2538780	2540860	the social costs of a neighborhood
2540860	2542660	consumption council request,
2542660	2544220	well then they're not asking for anything
2544220	2545860	that's not fair for them to have.
2547140	2549660	If they're asked, if it turns out the social cost
2549660	2552380	of that neighborhood consumption council request
2552380	2554780	is greater than their income is,
2554780	2556140	then they're being greedy.
2557220	2559580	And the rest of us have every right to say,
2559580	2561500	no, you can't do that.
2561500	2564220	Unless you can make some special argument
2564220	2566500	about why it is this year.
2568660	2571220	There were a bunch of people who got sick
2571220	2573300	and they had medical expenses.
2573300	2576900	Of course, we're gonna have medical expenses free anyway.
2576900	2579940	But so there are special circumstances that might come in.
2579940	2582620	So the basic point is,
2582620	2587580	there is an easy way for everybody to evaluate
2587580	2588860	first their own proposal.
2588860	2590300	When you make a proposal,
2590300	2591540	presumably you'd like to know
2591540	2593020	if it's socially responsible.
2594500	2596420	So the only way you know that is to look and see
2596420	2598780	is our social benefit to social cost ratio
2598780	2601180	at least one, if not higher.
2601180	2603660	And then you'd like to know if your consumption proposal
2603660	2606180	is socially responsible.
2606180	2608660	And that basically comes down to is the social cost
2608660	2610980	of what you're asking to consume,
2610980	2614340	greater than what your income and your fair income
2614340	2617180	based on sort of efforts and needs and things
2617180	2619180	and various things that we've worked out.
2620700	2623380	So you wanna know that about your own proposals,
2623380	2624740	but there's a way to do it.
2626220	2629060	We've got these estimates of social costs
2629060	2632620	and opportunity costs that allow the proposers
2632620	2635140	to figure out whether their own proposal
2635140	2636940	is socially responsible.
2636940	2640060	And importantly, it lets all the other councils
2640060	2643180	do the same, which is why you don't need
2643180	2644940	central planners to say no.
2647100	2650060	We've provided the councils with the information
2650860	2653100	necessary so that they can self-police
2656140	2660180	and do it fairly quickly without a lot of,
2660180	2662340	you know, debate and discussion.
2664580	2669580	And I think that's the thing that I'm sort of most anxious
2670020	2672260	to emphasize that aspect of it.
2674420	2678340	Because I think a large part of the reason
2678380	2681220	that people are drawn to sort of models
2681220	2685140	of market socialism is well,
2685140	2687700	the market takes care of all this for us.
2687700	2689660	And the only alternative is just going to be
2689660	2691980	a tremendous amount of arguing.
2691980	2693900	That's just gonna go on forever.
2693900	2697380	I mean, one of my colleagues here in the United States,
2697380	2700300	a socialist feminist economist named Nancy Fulbright.
2703020	2705860	And early on her reaction to participatory,
2705860	2708540	you know, the participatory economy proposal was,
2708540	2710060	Robin, you're a really nice guy.
2710060	2712020	I understand what you're trying to do here.
2712020	2714140	We're all in favor of all that,
2714140	2717940	but this is gonna lead to the dictatorship of the sociable
2719940	2724220	by which she meant, and as anybody who's been in the,
2724220	2727420	as anybody has participated in left politics long enough,
2728300	2732060	you know, one of the nightmares is that the meeting comes,
2732060	2734300	the meeting is called to order,
2734300	2736540	probably starts an hour late,
2736540	2739540	and there's arguing and debating and back and forth.
2739540	2742140	And we've gone on for two or three or four hours
2742140	2744540	and sensible people have to go home.
2744540	2747060	And in the end, the argument goes on and on and on.
2747060	2748940	And it's whoever was most stubborn
2748940	2750900	and whoever stayed till two in the morning
2750900	2752900	who finally ends up deciding things.
2753940	2756820	And you don't want a system that comes down to that.
2758620	2761420	And one of the things that I think is very important
2761420	2763460	about our proposal is,
2763460	2768460	we think we have made the central planning agency obsolete.
2769060	2770580	You don't need it.
2770580	2773980	And yet we have not burdened people
2773980	2777820	with endless amounts of meeting time and discussion time.
2777820	2779860	And we haven't put people in a situation
2779860	2782780	where the only criteria for making the decision
2782780	2785700	is who was just most stubborn and held out the longest.
2786700	2791700	That there's sort of objective ways to quickly decide
2791980	2795980	was that proposal socially responsible or irresponsible.
2795980	2798020	And as long as it's socially responsible,
2798020	2800340	whether it's coming from a neighborhood consumption council
2800340	2801900	or a workplace,
2801900	2804700	the rest of us should be totally happy to let them do it.
2806020	2808980	And there's an easy, and we think that this can all,
2808980	2811100	I mean, we now know from the simulations
2811100	2814740	that this shouldn't take more than five or six simulations
2814740	2816180	to come up with an annual plan,
2816180	2818860	which can easily be done in the month of December.
2819940	2821940	That's not to say that there won't be
2821940	2823660	some special circumstances
2823660	2825700	that need to have further discussion.
2826940	2828500	And we can talk about that,
2828500	2831940	but unless you can take care of the bulk of the decisions
2833100	2838100	in a way that doesn't require a long trial of some sort,
2838860	2843860	or a tremendously long and long set of meetings,
2845500	2848900	as long as you're only using those procedures
2848900	2850940	for a very small number of cases
2850940	2852900	that really are special circumstances
2852900	2854300	and deserve special attention,
2854300	2857380	we think then it's not a practical impossibility.
2857380	2860340	Maybe as a quick follow-up question,
2860340	2865340	so I absolutely understand that you have this notion of,
2867620	2870460	let's call it parametric coordination
2870460	2873420	that makes all of these processes very much easier
2873420	2875020	as you just stated,
2875020	2879260	but within these situations where the councils decide
2879260	2881020	over the proposals of each other,
2881020	2884140	and they do have these parametric indicators
2884140	2887340	that are at the end boiling down
2887340	2890580	to a ratio of social benefit and social costs,
2890580	2892260	which makes it easier to decide
2892260	2895820	whether something is really of social benefit or not.
2897500	2900500	What would be the mechanisms that allow
2900540	2905540	for going beyond this kind of parametric decision-making?
2905860	2907700	Because as you just stated,
2907700	2911900	there might be situations in which this is not sufficient.
2911900	2915580	This is not like addressing the specific context
2915580	2917980	of a given situation,
2917980	2920740	whether in a council or a workers council
2920740	2923540	or consumers council for that matter,
2923540	2926020	it might not be sufficient to address
2926020	2928180	the complete context of the situation.
2928180	2932180	So what would be the mechanisms to address things
2932180	2936300	that go beyond this parametric evaluation?
2936300	2939140	Yes, but there will be situations
2939140	2943260	where some sort of special consideration is warranted.
2943260	2944780	So what might that look like?
2944780	2946260	Before I answer that,
2946260	2949220	let me just summarize what it is that any worker council
2949220	2951860	or neighborhood consumer council has to do or not do.
2952820	2956820	It has to make its own initial proposal.
2958620	2963060	It has to revise that proposal, its own proposal.
2965100	2969700	And it has to revise that proposal maybe five or six times.
2971660	2975940	It also has to vote thumbs up or thumbs down
2977420	2979380	on all the other proposals.
2979380	2984380	Now, ordinarily thumbs up or thumbs down
2985340	2987620	is just if the other proposal
2987620	2990940	didn't have a social benefit to social cost ratio
2990940	2994900	that was at least one, our vote is thumbs down.
2996380	2999180	So it doesn't take a big thinking process.
2999180	3001060	So that's all that any worker council
3001060	3003300	or consumer council has to do for itself
3003300	3004780	and its own proposals.
3004780	3009780	And it's when they're voting thumbs up or thumbs down
3010540	3013500	that they're doing what a central planning agency
3013500	3016500	would do in a different kind of economy, okay?
3016500	3020700	But it shouldn't take any time.
3022140	3022980	Now, what about,
3025100	3026860	so here would be an example.
3026860	3030980	We have a worker's council and they've made their proposal
3030980	3034340	and if their social benefit to social cost ratio
3034340	3037220	is one or higher, they don't have to make any appeals.
3037220	3038700	They're gonna be approved.
3038700	3042140	It's not, it's only 0.9.
3042180	3044900	So it looks like somehow the social costs
3044900	3047940	of all the inputs they're using are larger than the social,
3047940	3049300	but they know that's wrong.
3049300	3051340	They believe this is wrong.
3051340	3053580	They believe the numbers lie.
3054500	3057940	I think we need to set up what I call appeal procedures.
3058820	3061380	So while the whole plan is being made,
3061380	3065140	it should be possible for a worker's council to say,
3065140	3068620	look, we know there's something going on
3068620	3070260	where the numbers are lying
3070260	3072820	and our proposal really is socially responsible
3072820	3075940	and we want the opportunity to explain that to somebody.
3077140	3080420	And so I think that you need to include that.
3080420	3083140	I mean, in a real world version of this,
3083140	3085820	you would have to allow for councils
3085820	3087740	to do that kind of appealing.
3087740	3091740	But notice what a successful appeal
3091740	3096260	isn't going to be presenting a whole long description
3096260	3098940	of how wonderful they think their workplace is
3098940	3101300	and how wonderful their ideas are.
3101300	3105100	No, no, a successful appeal will have to take the form of
3106100	3109620	the estimates of the social benefits and the social costs
3109620	3112100	is accurately, inaccurately measuring
3112100	3113500	something that we're doing.
3115900	3118900	And I think therefore, appeals,
3121820	3126020	as long as appeals are a small fraction
3126020	3127860	of what we have to deal with,
3127860	3131060	and as long as the appeal procedure
3131060	3133660	takes a very coherent form,
3133660	3138660	which is the applicant has to basically make a case
3139700	3142780	that they're being charged.
3142780	3145660	I mean, here being an easy example,
3145660	3147460	there's an opportunity cost
3147460	3149820	of using a particular kind of machine.
3149820	3152260	And they can say, well, it's right for most of the machines
3152260	3155220	of this kind, but ours are dilapidated.
3156220	3159020	So it looks like we're using things
3159020	3161580	that have a higher opportunity cost than it does,
3161580	3166580	because so essentially the appeal process
3166660	3169980	takes a form of challenging the accuracy
3169980	3174180	of what's being used to measure in the particular case.
3175700	3178340	The appeal procedure for a neighborhood consumption council
3178340	3181220	might also be on the grounds that,
3181220	3183500	although they could do this out of savings too.
3183900	3187780	So a neighborhood consumption council could say,
3187780	3188940	we were hit by a flood.
3189980	3193820	And sure, we could go ahead and say,
3193820	3196020	we need a lot of stuff for repairs,
3196020	3197900	and it comes out of our income,
3197900	3200380	and we can even go ahead and be approved to borrow,
3200380	3203140	but we really shouldn't even be charged for this.
3203140	3205740	I mean, we are victims of the disaster,
3205740	3208980	and therefore there needs to be an exception in our case
3208980	3210980	of what it is that we're asking for,
3210980	3213620	and we shouldn't have to pay for all of that
3213620	3215500	out of our entire income.
3215500	3216900	I mean, you could handle that
3216900	3219580	through disaster relief programs too,
3219580	3224020	but something that's not a disaster relief program magnitude
3224020	3226020	that might not qualify for it,
3226020	3227580	still is something that a neighborhood
3227580	3229740	consumption council could appeal.
3229740	3234620	For me, the trick is design a procedure
3234620	3237660	where it's only a tiny fraction of cases
3237660	3239780	where you would need appeals,
3239780	3243380	and then make sure that the appeal process is one
3243380	3248220	where the appeal process has some grounds for adjudication
3248220	3250820	that are sort of rational and make sense.
3250820	3253860	So we do have a feasible plan right now.
3253860	3258220	This plan has been approved by all of the different councils,
3258220	3261140	consumer councils and worker councils.
3261140	3266140	So maybe as an addition that the audience
3266220	3269860	has not yet have as an information,
3269860	3271900	the information that the different consumer
3271900	3276500	and producer councils have provided into the process,
3276500	3279420	this information is aggregated information.
3279420	3281340	It's not detailed information.
3281340	3284540	It's not that every consumer council has proposed
3284540	3287060	every detail of each good
3287060	3290260	and provided this information for the process,
3290260	3292180	but it's aggregated information.
3292180	3296580	So we are now within our imaginary planning process
3296580	3300140	at the point where we have a feasible plan.
3300140	3301580	It has been approved,
3301580	3306220	but the plan entails more or less broad informations
3306220	3308660	about what has to be produced.
3309540	3310780	What are the next steps?
3310780	3314500	How is this aggregated information transformed
3314500	3318940	into detailed products by the worker councils?
3318940	3323940	So on January 1st, we have a feasible,
3324220	3326540	efficient annual production plan,
3327420	3330100	but there's two problems.
3330100	3331500	There's still two problems.
3332940	3337940	One is at plan says the categories are gonna be categories
3340100	3344660	such as women's dress shoes.
3345660	3349780	It's not going to be size such and such.
3349780	3354100	It's not going to be, I don't remember what I called it,
3354100	3356260	but I had a funny name for it.
3356260	3361260	You know, the woman's leather high-heeled shoes
3361420	3363740	with the yellow toes problem.
3365620	3370620	So the plan is going to be in terms of sort of
3371100	3374340	broad categories of goods and services.
3374380	3379260	And yet you have to produce a particular shoe
3379260	3381500	that might be a little bit different.
3381500	3384020	How does that all get worked out during the year?
3384020	3385380	That's one question.
3385380	3388780	And another question that's, it's related.
3388780	3390860	It's a little different, but it's related.
3390860	3395860	And that is by January 15th,
3396060	3398580	something we assumed when we made the plan
3398580	3399980	isn't gonna be true anymore.
3400980	3405980	So there's both the, how do you translate
3406540	3411540	broad categories of goods into detailed categories of goods,
3411900	3416100	and how do you adjust for things that happen
3416100	3419140	that were not foreseen when the plan was drawn up?
3420620	3425620	And here's where the conversation has been very difficult
3427460	3428940	amongst leftists.
3428940	3431940	And I'll give you two examples.
3431940	3436940	The Jacobin dismissed the whole idea
3437020	3442020	of a participatory economy entirely on the grounds
3442020	3446020	that obviously planning, you know, for an economy
3446020	3450020	that has, they use the example on Amazon alone,
3450020	3453700	there's so many millions of different goods.
3453700	3457020	So how could you have a broad category of goods
3458020	3460900	so how could you ever plan for how much
3460900	3462220	of those millions of goods?
3462220	3463700	And that's just Amazon alone.
3465260	3468980	David Schweikert, who is a proponent of market socialism,
3468980	3472220	where he says, well, markets can handle this, but you can't.
3473860	3476580	Basically said, well, the whole thing is very interesting.
3476580	3478460	This idea of a participatory economy,
3478460	3480100	but it's just nonsense on stilts
3480100	3481820	because it can't handle this.
3482140	3487140	It's been 30 years now since there were any planned economies.
3488500	3490580	Now there's still a planned economy in Cuba.
3490580	3492340	I don't know what they have in North Korea,
3492340	3494620	but I think it's a planned economy.
3494620	3498060	So, but nobody knows anything about them anymore.
3498060	3500980	So in popular consciousness,
3500980	3504980	there's no memory anymore apparently that, you know,
3504980	3509060	the Soviet economy did actually manage, you know,
3509260	3513220	to plod along for, you know, going on 50 years
3513220	3514260	in the Eastern Europe.
3515380	3517420	And as anybody should now realize,
3517420	3520020	I'm not a proponent of that system,
3520020	3523420	but the whole notion that comprehensive planning
3523420	3528420	is just a practical impossibility is belied by the fact that,
3528420	3531700	well, it obviously wasn't a practical impossibility.
3531700	3534620	It might've been a very undesirable way to do things,
3534620	3536620	but it wasn't a practical impossibility
3537060	3539900	There must be some way to translate, you know,
3539900	3543900	from broader categories to more refined categories.
3543900	3546500	And there must be some way to make adjustments
3546500	3547340	during the year,
3547340	3548860	because there were a whole bunch of economies
3548860	3552020	that managed to do that for decades and decades.
3552020	3554420	Not to say they did it well,
3555420	3557540	and not to say that it wasn't,
3557540	3560820	and that some of the sort of obvious problems
3560820	3562580	that those economies had,
3562780	3564900	which, I mean, the major problem
3564900	3567620	that the centrally planned economies was that,
3567620	3568780	I mean, one major problem
3568780	3571180	was they really disenfranchised consumers.
3572180	3574260	So everybody's aware of the, oh yeah,
3574260	3577620	I mean, in the Soviet Union, you know, you could get shoes,
3577620	3579740	but everybody's shoes all look the same.
3580620	3582100	Well, by the end of the Soviet Union,
3582100	3583580	that wasn't really true.
3583580	3586860	On the other hand, the variety that capitalists
3586860	3589340	and market systems had to deal with,
3589340	3591940	the variety that capitalists
3591940	3594300	and market systems had to offer,
3594300	3596660	I don't think that variety was ever offered
3596660	3598460	by any centrally planned economy.
3598460	3602220	So it's a reasonable idea that maybe planned economies
3602220	3607220	are not as nimble in these regards.
3607420	3608540	But that's what it comes down to.
3608540	3610660	It's not like it's a practical impossibility.
3610660	3611940	We know that's the case.
3613100	3615220	Well, here's how you would translate.
3616220	3618340	So you have a plan,
3618340	3621420	you're a workers council and you're making shoes.
3621420	3623620	And you have a plan that's approved to you,
3623620	3625060	you know, that's been approved for you
3625060	3628780	to make certain amounts of shoes, you know, for adult women.
3630180	3631700	And you go ahead and make them.
3631700	3634420	And they get shipped to the distribution centers
3634420	3636380	and people start picking them up.
3636380	3640860	And it turns out that the red ones are going like hotcakes
3640860	3643380	and the yellow ones are just sitting on the shelf.
3644340	3646140	Well, you do just exactly
3646140	3648620	what any capitalist shoe making business does.
3649580	3651260	You know, you shift over
3651260	3653460	and you start making more of the red ones
3653460	3655620	and you make fewer of the yellow ones.
3656500	3658580	So in terms of detail,
3659940	3663260	it works out in a planned economy,
3663260	3666220	just the way, there's no reason it can't work out
3666220	3668540	in a planned economy that is sensitive
3668540	3670500	to what the consumers want.
3670500	3674140	Now, I mean, this is an interesting question.
3674140	3676780	And I do think that one of the things
3676780	3681780	that capitalism has done has disempowered consumers
3683060	3688060	relative to producers in all sorts of important ways.
3688140	3690460	So what it's gonna come down to is,
3690460	3694300	so I'm shipping shoes,
3694300	3697420	but the shoes I'm shipping aren't being picked up.
3698380	3700420	What if I don't change?
3701100	3704060	What if I continue to ship the yellow shoes
3704060	3707020	when the red ones are going like hotcakes?
3707020	3709820	Well, then the issue is, well, do I get credit for that?
3711660	3714300	And another issue is,
3714300	3718460	and this is sort of relevant to sort of empowering consumers.
3720780	3724620	One of the problems consumers face in market systems is
3724620	3727620	you didn't get something that you thought you were getting.
3728060	3731860	Now, of course, every capitalist business
3731860	3736220	mouths the slogan, the consumer is always right.
3737340	3739020	But it's totally insincere.
3740300	3741500	I mean, what they mean is,
3741500	3743660	we're gonna tell you you're always right,
3743660	3747500	but we're gonna make sure that we don't have
3747500	3750980	to exchange your product unless we absolutely have to,
3750980	3754020	and we're gonna make it as difficult as possible for you.
3755020	3759620	So, I mean, one of the things we've suggested is,
3759620	3762380	wouldn't it be nice if as a consumer,
3762380	3765940	something you get delivered isn't what you expected.
3765940	3769540	Instead of you fighting with the workers council
3769540	3771380	that produced that and delivered that,
3771380	3775660	you just turn it back over to your consumer federation,
3775660	3777620	say, it's unacceptable,
3777620	3780940	and let your consumer federation battle
3780940	3783980	in a much more powerful position with the workers council
3784980	3789220	and its federation about whether or not this was up to specs.
3789220	3794220	So my answer is, there are answers to these problems.
3795740	3798260	The popular consciousness,
3798260	3800940	we now have 30 years when none of these economies
3800940	3805700	that were comprehensively planned have existed.
3806780	3810140	And so people are having a hard time imagining
3810140	3811740	how it's even possible.
3811740	3813540	There's an analogy to this.
3813580	3815420	Before Adam Smith came along,
3816340	3821340	popular consciousness was, how could it possibly work?
3822820	3824980	How could a market system possibly work?
3826660	3830900	I mean, how will the producers know
3830900	3832180	what the consumers want?
3834500	3838020	So, I mean, feudalism made economic decisions
3838020	3840060	in a certain way, and Adam Smith was saying,
3840060	3842380	we don't need to make economic decisions that way at all.
3842380	3845380	We can just leave, we can have individual producers
3845380	3847580	and individual consumers out there,
3847580	3849060	and as long as they can buy and sell
3849060	3851700	from one another in a market, it's all gonna work out.
3852980	3854340	And there was a time in history
3854340	3856860	where people just had a hard time imagining that.
3857940	3859500	And he became famous for saying,
3859500	3862620	see, something you can't even imagine
3862620	3864940	is actually readily possible.
3864940	3867420	And I think we're back in a similar situation
3867420	3868940	where we're arguing
3868940	3872900	that you can do comprehensive planning.
3872900	3874820	It's not a practical impossibility,
3874820	3877140	but for 30 years, nobody has seen it
3877140	3879380	and everybody just can't imagine it anymore.
3880780	3883300	But I think we've got perfectly sensible answers
3883300	3887540	for how the more broad categories
3887540	3892220	get translated into more refined categories.
3892220	3896220	It's simply, when it's delivered,
3897180	3899100	some things will be picked up and purchased
3899100	3900900	and some things won't,
3900900	3903100	and you do sensible adjustments
3903100	3905700	when that turns out to be the case.
3905700	3908220	That means you're gonna have to order more red dye
3908220	3910980	and less yellow dye, and then that's an adjustment
3910980	3912980	that's gonna have to be made too.
3912980	3915420	My answer to the doubting Thomas's is,
3915420	3917060	that's not rocket science.
3918060	3919900	Do you really wanna argue about that?
3921180	3925700	I mean, maybe as an addition, you used the term
3925700	3928460	that the producers will need to be sensitive
3928460	3931300	to what people actually consume.
3931300	3934060	One might add that, I mean,
3934060	3939060	there are sensors proliferating throughout the world today,
3939300	3941660	and we have digital technologies,
3941660	3944260	information and communication technologies
3944260	3949260	that are very much able to sense much more
3950140	3951900	than was able before.
3951900	3956500	So this might also be a factor that comes into play.
3956500	3957980	That's something that is out there
3957980	3960700	in popular consciousness, and I think it's good,
3960700	3964340	which is that technologies have changed a lot
3965500	3970500	in terms of just supply-side management technologies
3971260	3972620	have changed a lot.
3972620	3976420	And the ability, I mean, I buy all my books,
3976420	3978340	I probably shouldn't admit to this
3978340	3980260	because I'm obviously not supporting
3980260	3982100	my local leftist bookstore.
3983620	3987940	But when I can buy a digital version
3987940	3991420	of a book I want on Amazon and get it on my Kindle
3994820	3999100	in literally five seconds, yes, I do that.
3999100	4002660	So there's been changes in technology
4002660	4006220	that basically make all of this adjustment stuff
4007180	4010620	a lot easier than it would have been 40 years ago.
4011860	4013900	But I wanna point out,
4013900	4016300	so I think that the things we're talking about
4016300	4019940	in terms of how speedy and efficient
4019940	4023420	can the detail and adjustment process be
4023420	4028180	given today's technologies as compared to 40 years ago,
4028180	4029580	actually a lot better.
4029580	4033100	But I don't wanna concede the point
4033100	4034980	that we could have still had this kind of economy
4034980	4036020	40 years ago.
4037220	4039460	It just wouldn't have been quite as quick and efficient
4039460	4040700	about making the adjustments,
4040700	4043060	but it would have been fine 40 years ago too.
4043060	4044100	It wasn't like the new,
4044100	4047460	we didn't have to wait for these new technologies.
4047460	4049140	And there's a similar,
4049140	4051900	sort of the socialist calculation debate
4053100	4055260	had a similar issue,
4055260	4058180	which was the original objection
4058180	4063180	to socialist economies that came from the Austrians
4064580	4069580	was, well, it's just too many equations.
4069620	4070900	You could never solve all the,
4070900	4072700	they were imagining central planning
4072700	4073540	and they were saying,
4073540	4076860	there's no way you could possibly solve all those equations.
4076860	4078740	And that's the beauty of the market system.
4078740	4080780	You don't need a huge computer.
4082140	4086620	And they were right that in 1900
4086980	4090380	when the debate was going on was like pre-World War I
4090380	4092660	and sort of post-World War I.
4092660	4097660	They were right that we didn't have powerful computers.
4098020	4103020	And people like Paul Cotshot and Alan Cottrell,
4103020	4103900	they've made the point,
4103900	4106260	but now we do have these computers.
4106260	4109580	So we could calculate a very, very detailed,
4109580	4111260	large central plan.
4111260	4115220	And my answer is, yes, we could now and we couldn't then,
4115220	4117820	but we still don't want to, but for different reasons,
4117820	4120660	just because we can do it doesn't mean we want to do it.
4120660	4121700	But in this case, yeah,
4121700	4124300	of course we would want to use all that new technology
4124300	4126100	to make the adjustment process.
4127100	4128700	You want to adjust for details,
4128700	4131260	you want to adjust for unseen events.
4131260	4132820	And if we've got new technologies
4132820	4135220	that would make all that easier and more efficient,
4135220	4137740	of course that makes the whole thing work better.
4137740	4140060	We should be very happy about that.
4140060	4143620	So now we have actually transformed
4143620	4146700	these aggregated information
4146700	4150100	into aggregated pieces for production,
4150100	4151300	inputs for production,
4151300	4155420	and they have been transformed into detailed products
4155420	4157380	by the workers councils.
4157380	4162380	And from there on, people will go to stores
4162860	4165180	just like they do nowadays
4165180	4167500	and will purchase these items,
4167500	4172180	depending on how much credit, so to speak,
4172180	4175700	they have coming from their work
4175700	4178060	within each workers council.
4178060	4179980	So I'm a consumer
4179980	4184140	and I had an annual consumption proposal
4184140	4185380	that's been pre-approved.
4186260	4191260	And so now, and I want to admit to something personally,
4192260	4193700	I don't shop.
4195620	4197900	There's only one thing I shop for,
4197900	4199420	I'm the cook in my family.
4200420	4203500	So I shop for, I go to food stores.
4203500	4205500	So I shop in food stores,
4205500	4208820	which is why I know how people shop,
4208820	4211700	because I don't think I've ever bought a piece of clothing
4211700	4212540	I've ever worn.
4213340	4216940	So I shop for books and I shop for food.
4216940	4219820	When I shop for, and when I shop for food,
4219820	4221620	I'm a bargain hunter.
4221620	4224100	So that's why I know when I go up and down the aisles,
4224100	4227780	I'm looking to see what the price tag on that thing is today.
4227860	4229860	And if it's not a sale price tag,
4229860	4231100	I'm gonna probably pass it up
4231100	4232980	and hope for something better tomorrow.
4232980	4235180	So that's why I know that when people shop,
4235180	4238500	you show them price signals and that's how they respond.
4239460	4242060	But the whole idea of sort of shopping
4243700	4245380	is really foreign to me.
4245380	4246900	And I had a group of students
4246900	4249100	who came into my office one day
4249100	4252060	and they said, well, we're in your class
4252060	4255820	and you've been talking about this participatory economy.
4256740	4258780	But there's just one thing that
4260460	4263860	we either don't understand or we don't like about it.
4263860	4265900	And what they said was,
4267020	4270180	you don't really understand the pleasures of mauling it.
4271900	4275300	And I thought they were saying maul, M-A-U-L.
4277420	4279860	And then it turned out, no, no,
4279860	4283780	they meant the pleasures of going to the shopping mall,
4283820	4288620	seeing and being seen and just deciding on the spot,
4288620	4291340	what do you wanna buy or not buy?
4291340	4293820	And I told them, I said, you're absolutely right.
4294780	4296700	Your dream is my nightmare,
4296700	4300580	being caught in a shopping mall for more than five minutes
4300580	4303500	it would be a death sentence as far as I'm concerned.
4303500	4305580	It's the last thing I'd ever wanna do.
4305580	4310580	But I understand, you have a reasonable demand here.
4310940	4315940	And so that is a question of how do you accommodate that?
4316300	4318780	And so the whole idea, I never thought about
4318780	4323580	how the goods are actually being picked up and distributed.
4323580	4324740	I just thought of people as,
4324740	4326620	well, you're going to your local food store
4326620	4328300	and that's how you get the food
4328300	4330060	that you're gonna go home and cook.
4331540	4334340	But there's no reason that you can't have shopping malls.
4335300	4337220	I remember at one point in time,
4337220	4339380	and I think it's still true in Cuba,
4339380	4344380	they used to do, they did these big displays.
4344660	4347740	They wanted to show people in Cuba,
4347740	4351460	what new kinds of goods might become soon available
4351460	4354340	that they hadn't been seeing for a while.
4354340	4357420	And so they would do these sort of demos.
4357420	4360700	And they would put on sort of like a fair
4360700	4365700	where the economic ministry was basically saying,
4365780	4368780	basically saying, come out to think
4368780	4370200	like a shopping mall thing,
4370200	4371820	we're gonna show you new products
4371820	4373780	so you're gonna see the kinds of things.
4373780	4375860	There's no reason that we can't,
4375860	4378140	those would all be good ideas.
4378140	4382100	But essentially my vision always was certain items
4382100	4385180	would get distributed to distribution centers,
4385180	4387540	which really are only for one neighborhood.
4388740	4390660	Other items is probably gonna have to cover
4390660	4392500	four or five neighborhoods,
4392500	4395300	the kinds of goods that get sent there to be distributed.
4395300	4397860	But I always envisioned is you're picking it up,
4397860	4399820	you've got your swipe card.
4399820	4401600	At some point along the line,
4401600	4403380	your swipe card starts to tell you
4403380	4406140	that you're actually picking up more of certain things
4406140	4408220	than that you had ordered.
4408220	4409620	Do you wanna make an adjustment
4409620	4411820	or is this just something that you're gonna make up for?
4411820	4414060	That's where the new technology really is,
4414060	4416660	really should help in making the adjustments.
4418740	4421980	But that's the kind of process that I think
4421980	4424680	from the point of view of a non-shopper,
4424680	4426880	that's about the best I can say.
4426880	4430440	Yeah, and I think it's quite important for many people
4430440	4433240	that there is some form of flexibility still
4433240	4434680	and that you do not,
4434680	4439680	that you're not hold to buying exactly the things
4440020	4443700	that you were thinking of at the beginning of the year,
4443700	4446740	but this could be done in a fashion where,
4446740	4451740	I don't know, if you achieve an amount of like 80 to 90%
4451800	4453880	of things that you already knew
4453880	4456440	that you will consume, this is very good.
4456440	4460240	And then if there rests 10 or 20% of goods
4460240	4461760	that you consume over the year
4461760	4464600	are those that are being consumed in a more dynamic
4464600	4466540	and flexible and spontaneous way,
4466540	4468480	then this is still an improvement, I guess.
4468480	4472360	So this doesn't have to be an either or situation.
4472360	4475500	I would concur, that's the way I think about it too.
4475500	4476720	There are two issues.
4476720	4478840	I mean, one is easy to take care of.
4478840	4481760	What if somebody during a year ends up
4481760	4485720	consuming less than they were,
4485720	4489320	I mean, the sum total social cost of what they consume
4489320	4490960	is less what they're approved for.
4490960	4491800	Well, that's easy.
4491800	4494120	Then it just goes into,
4494120	4496560	it adds to their savings and the savings account.
4497560	4500360	Now, what about somebody who ends up consuming more
4500360	4502880	than they were approved for during the year?
4502880	4505980	Well, in that case, they're basically borrowing.
4507680	4510880	And it's some, I mean, I don't think you ever have
4510880	4513120	to sit in judgment over us.
4513120	4514720	If somebody wants to save,
4514720	4517240	who the hell is ever gonna say no?
4517240	4519000	If somebody wants to borrow,
4519000	4521160	and oh, but you're borrowing every year
4521160	4523240	and you've been borrowing every year for 15 years
4523240	4525080	and it's kind of becoming clear
4525080	4526780	that you aren't really planning
4526780	4529320	or whether you're planning to pay it back
4531180	4534360	or you're just, you think you're planning to play it back
4534360	4537320	but it's becoming rather obvious to the rest of us
4537320	4540280	that you can't, somebody has to sit in judgment over this.
4540280	4543640	One of my daughters works for credit unions
4543640	4546800	and basically has, one of her jobs is
4546800	4551360	people taking out new car loans to buy new cars.
4551360	4554040	And so she's constantly watching cases where,
4554040	4556120	yeah, you thought you had a credible plan
4556120	4559080	about your payments, but in fact, you don't.
4559080	4562040	So I think of it more as you're still gonna have
4562040	4564340	something like credit unions
4564340	4567920	and a credit union is going to have to sort of,
4567920	4569240	they're gonna have to monitor
4569240	4572240	whether borrowing has become insincere.
4576880	4581160	But there's total flexibility about saving and borrowing
4581160	4584400	in terms of the grand sum total of what you're spending
4584400	4587420	in a year being different from what you proposed.
4587420	4590280	There's really no problem in handling that.
4590280	4593800	The difficulty is for particular items.
4593800	4598800	So if certain things, for a certain item,
4599760	4602320	the grand total amount that consumers
4602320	4604960	are taking off the shelves
4604960	4607640	is greater than what was planned for,
4607640	4610200	then we have a decision to make,
4610200	4612200	well, who's gonna get it and who isn't?
4613760	4617280	And there you would have a complicated,
4617280	4620000	I mean, there I think you have a somewhat complicated issue.
4620000	4622960	Well, I had it in my order
4625440	4628000	and so should I have priority over somebody
4628000	4630060	who didn't have it in their order.
4631040	4632360	And there's another issue about,
4632360	4634300	well, do we just also take care of this
4634300	4635740	by adjusting the price?
4636840	4639680	And in the latest book I wrote,
4639680	4641360	I sort of discussed these very,
4641360	4644500	what are the pros and cons of handling these situations
4644500	4648380	which will inevitably arise one way or another?
4648380	4650480	And I think there are some pros and cons
4650480	4652080	of handling it one way or another
4652080	4654400	and there are issues that will arise.
4655320	4658080	I mean, like from the tip of my head,
4658080	4662760	I would say like you could easily reserve some item
4662760	4664160	for a period of time
4664160	4668600	and if it's not consumed during this time period,
4668600	4671880	it will be free to consume for anybody else
4671880	4674040	who's interested in the item.
4674040	4678060	And then additionally, this question of pricing
4678060	4681880	comes into play, but that's just a side note.
4681880	4685040	There is a complimentary aspect
4685040	4687580	to this question of consumer flexibility
4687580	4689780	and that is the question of flexibility
4689780	4691120	on the side of producers
4691120	4694480	because another thing that the Austrians brought forward
4694480	4696240	and you mentioned them already
4696240	4698920	in the context of the socialist calculation debate,
4698920	4701180	another thing that the Austrians brought forward
4701180	4706180	is this question of competition as a discovery mechanism
4706200	4710920	and the question of how does innovation come into being,
4710920	4714360	into the world, into how is this idea
4714360	4718400	of the new being handled within an economic system?
4718400	4723400	So how would Perkin go about this process of innovation?
4723820	4728820	How is it being decided whether or not resources
4729520	4733440	can be allocated sensibly into a direction
4733440	4737720	which might not be like fully developed
4737720	4740540	where the odds are not clear
4740540	4743660	whether or not something might succeed or not.
4743660	4747260	So how is all of this being decided upon?
4747260	4749700	Yeah, by the way, the, I mean, the tooth,
4749700	4753180	that the whole Austrian school and the Austrian debate
4754160	4756940	in the popular consciousness in the United States,
4756940	4758740	it's quite different than in Europe.
4759620	4762220	In Europe, you all know the Austrian school,
4762220	4766300	you all know von Mises, you all know Hayek
4766300	4768140	and then you know the names of a few other people
4768140	4768980	who I don't.
4769980	4772420	In the United States, the only name we know in this regard
4772420	4774180	is somebody named Milton Friedman
4775820	4778660	who was not part of the Austrian school,
4778660	4781220	but who sort of,
4784140	4786460	he took their arguments,
4786460	4791460	dumbed them down, also screwed them up to a great extent
4792000	4796900	and basically that became sort of what his popular
4796900	4800220	consciousness about the impossibility of socialism
4800220	4803040	being sensible to a US audience.
4804340	4807700	So I just wanted to throw that out there in terms of,
4807700	4810300	there are certain subjects where,
4810300	4813100	I mean, it's the same as social democracy.
4813100	4815220	You all know what that means in the United States,
4815220	4816720	nobody knows what that means.
4818620	4820540	It's the same as libertarian socialism,
4820540	4822860	you all know what that means and in the United States,
4822860	4824660	it means something very different.
4824700	4827260	But anyway, to your question about innovation
4828460	4832100	and I think this is a very legitimate concern.
4832100	4835300	I think the conclusion
4835300	4837740	that the centrally planned socialist economies
4839720	4844720	were deficient in terms of their ability to generate
4845440	4850440	sort of innovative economic activities.
4851240	4854600	I think it's well taken.
4855560	4858640	And so when I study those systems to try and figure out,
4858640	4862480	well, what was it about their incentives?
4862480	4866320	What was it about their decision-making and reward systems
4866320	4869360	that led to such poor performance in this regard?
4869360	4870960	I think there was poor performance
4870960	4872400	and there have to be reasons for it
4872400	4874520	and it's important to understand what they were.
4874520	4876420	And so I spent a decent amount of time
4876420	4878600	studying the logic of central planning
4878600	4881800	and seeing why it would not be in the interest
4881800	4884160	of enterprise managers to innovate.
4885080	4887720	Why would they disguise their capabilities
4887720	4890720	rather than sort of try and stretch to?
4892480	4895080	Now, the first thing I would point out is
4895080	4899880	think of a worker's council in a participatory economy.
4900880	4903000	Anything they can do,
4903000	4905280	any innovation they could introduce
4905280	4908940	that would increase their social benefits
4908940	4910520	of what they're providing
4910520	4913440	or decrease the social costs of what they're using
4913440	4915240	is gonna rebound to their benefit
4916400	4917460	because it's gonna make it easier
4917460	4919840	to get their proposals accepted.
4919840	4922940	So if an enterprise could come up,
4925320	4928020	broadly speaking, there's two kinds of innovation.
4928020	4930920	One is anything that cuts down the costs
4931800	4932920	of what we're making
4933920	4937240	or anything that increases the sort of quality
4937240	4939240	and the quantity of what we're producing.
4940600	4943440	So we certainly have incentives
4943440	4946520	for workers councils to be searching for all those things.
4947540	4949640	Here is where there's a real dilemma though.
4951960	4956880	What if a worker's council comes up with a new innovation
4956880	4958960	that reduces its social costs
4958960	4960880	or increases its social benefits?
4963920	4967520	And any economy faces this dilemma.
4967520	4970120	So we have one unit that came up with the innovation.
4973020	4975200	It's very inefficient if the innovation
4975200	4976600	doesn't get immediately used
4976600	4979000	by all the other worker councils in the industry.
4980960	4984360	I mean, to have one council in the industry
4984360	4986440	doing something that's more efficient
4986440	4988980	and the rest of them aren't allowed to,
4988980	4990800	well, that seems silly.
4990800	4992400	And yet that's what patents do.
4993920	4996160	That's essentially what a patent does.
4997760	4999140	Now, maybe not forever,
4999140	5001480	maybe the patent only lasts for 20 years.
5002780	5005300	And once you have the patent,
5005300	5008840	you could sort of negotiate with other firms in the industry
5008840	5011600	and you could negotiate a price
5011600	5015240	and also allow them to use the patent for a certain payment.
5015240	5016720	But essentially what patents do
5016720	5020400	is they slow down the spread of innovation.
5021320	5026320	Oh, but they also provide a tremendous incentive to innovate
5028320	5031380	and that's the argument in favor of patents.
5031380	5036380	So my first observation is you really cannot have,
5040200	5042880	it seems like you can't have your cake and eat it too.
5043840	5046820	If you want what economists call static efficiency,
5046820	5048520	you want everybody to use the innovation
5048520	5049720	as quickly as possible.
5050440	5053520	But if you want quote unquote dynamic efficiency,
5053520	5056360	incentive to search for the innovation,
5056360	5058520	then you have to prevent it spread.
5058520	5060080	So it seems like there's a trade-off
5060080	5061960	between these two goals.
5061960	5065120	Well, we've taken one extreme position on this,
5065120	5067320	which is any innovation immediately
5067320	5070000	becomes available to everybody else.
5070000	5073120	So we're gonna spread immediately.
5074880	5077600	Does that diminish the incentive
5077600	5080000	for an enterprise, for a workers council
5080000	5081600	to look for innovations
5081600	5084960	because they basically can't sort of hoard it?
5086080	5088280	And I think maybe it does.
5088280	5092440	I mean, I think we have to honestly say, well, okay,
5092440	5097320	let's consider the consequence of immediately saying
5097320	5099700	all innovations are open to anybody.
5101960	5105360	And then the question is, well, what can you do?
5106360	5109880	And my answer is there's still two things you can do.
5110760	5114240	One is if you actually take a look at research,
5115600	5118920	a lot of innovative research in the United States,
5123960	5124840	in the United States,
5124840	5127960	there's sort of famous studies about innovation.
5127960	5130040	And what they've discovered is
5130040	5132880	the federal government of the United States
5132880	5137880	has paid for so much more innovation than anybody realizes.
5139040	5142080	Everybody thinks it's that creative entrepreneur out there
5142080	5143080	who did the innovation.
5143080	5145480	You'd be amazing how much your tax dollars
5145480	5146720	paid for innovation.
5146720	5148560	You'd be amazing at how much innovation
5148560	5151760	your tax dollars paid in the US military,
5153120	5158120	that became important innovation throughout the economy.
5158480	5160640	So there's another way to stimulate innovation,
5160640	5162880	which is basically just to pay for it.
5165400	5168640	So why shouldn't we have industry federations
5168640	5173640	with very large research institutes attached and budgets?
5175400	5178280	And why just have industry federations with that?
5178280	5181080	A lot of the innovations have to do with new products
5181080	5182920	from a consumer's point of view.
5182920	5185400	Let's have the consumer federations
5185400	5188120	also have very large research institutes
5188120	5189960	that are associated with them.
5189960	5193040	And then any research that those federations
5193040	5195640	manage to come up with, innovations that they...
5195640	5197520	Well, then of course, those federations...
5198440	5201560	It immediately goes to all the enterprises in the federation
5204240	5208600	because that's who the members of the federation are.
5208600	5210240	So that's one way.
5210240	5213040	And the other way is, and I've said this,
5214240	5216600	I think it would be very important
5216600	5220360	for a participatory economy to keep very close tabs
5220360	5223520	on whether they think that the economy
5223520	5225600	is sort of lacking for innovation.
5227320	5231920	And despite the fact
5231920	5234680	that they've got these big research institutes,
5234680	5238120	and despite the fact that if you can come up with a way
5238120	5240960	to improve your social benefit to social cost ratio,
5240960	5242560	it's to your advantage,
5242560	5246520	but everybody else is gonna get to use it right away too.
5247360	5248720	So if that proves to be a problem,
5248720	5250120	is there something we could still do?
5250120	5251560	And I think there is.
5253080	5256760	You simply grant prizes for innovation
5256760	5258480	to individual worker councils.
5260360	5265160	So if you need to dangle a sort of material benefit out there
5265160	5267720	for individual worker council innovation,
5267720	5269480	there's no reason you can't do it.
5269480	5272680	I would argue you're doing it at the expense of fairness.
5274960	5276400	I mean, it depends.
5277280	5280760	If you think that innovation is the result of extra effort,
5280760	5283280	then in some sense, it's not even at the expense
5283280	5287680	of economic justice if you're paying bonuses
5287680	5289720	for innovations coming from enterprise.
5291840	5293960	On the other hand, if you think that innovation
5293960	5296120	is largely not a result of that,
5296120	5301120	it's sort of luck and innovations are basically,
5302440	5305560	what they really are is it's a whole sort of process
5305560	5309480	through time that takes place.
5309480	5312200	And it's hard to say any particular person
5312200	5314480	was responsible for this whole thing.
5317080	5319160	And then I think that would simply
5319160	5320560	have to be a decision-making.
5320560	5322360	If the people in the economy felt
5322360	5323880	we're not being innovative enough,
5323880	5325800	we need to do something further,
5325800	5327000	then there's something you could do.
5327000	5331080	I would just quite, I think it's important
5331080	5333000	to always be honest about what you're doing,
5333000	5334680	at least with yourself.
5334680	5338320	And in this case, I think that what you might do is say,
5338320	5340160	we're worried about innovation,
5340160	5341960	we're putting a priority on it,
5342880	5344760	and we recognize that to some extent,
5344760	5348400	it might be at the expense of sort of economic justice.
5348400	5352320	I think there are plenty of ways to go about this.
5352320	5354240	And some of those you sketched,
5354240	5355920	I would definitely totally agree with.
5355920	5358080	And I think that additionally,
5358080	5361840	there might be some type of kind of crowdfunding.
5361840	5366560	There might be some budgets that are explicitly put away
5366560	5370640	for like some wildcard kind of stuff
5370640	5373880	where people that have an idea, an initial idea,
5373880	5377640	and that like carry some form of risk
5377640	5380000	in the form of resources that are needed
5380000	5382240	and that are not already like covered
5382240	5383960	in some way, shape or form,
5383960	5386320	that might apply for this kind of funding
5386320	5389280	and that is specifically put away
5389280	5392280	for like wildcard innovation or something like that.
5395800	5400800	Crowdfunding is very popular in the younger generation
5401400	5403360	and it's a pretty big deal.
5403360	5405200	There's a lot of it that goes on.
5405200	5408880	The crowdfunding that I am most impressed by
5408880	5413880	is that in our elections in the United States,
5413960	5418560	Republican candidates traditionally always get,
5418600	5421280	are much more adequately funded
5421280	5423440	than Democratic party candidates
5423440	5425720	because they're getting the big corporations
5425720	5427480	and the wealthy contributions.
5427480	5430640	And we basically don't prohibit that.
5430640	5432160	We don't say there are limits
5433520	5436040	or it's easy to get around the limits.
5436040	5438960	But one of the things that's happened basically
5438960	5441640	with the Bernie Sanders campaign
5441640	5446640	is that small donation funding for progressive candidates
5448560	5450080	has proved to be,
5450080	5453400	partly it's because of the rise of the internet too,
5455080	5457240	has proved to be remarkably,
5457240	5462240	it's even the money spending field
5464040	5466920	in a lot of races in the United States over recently.
5466920	5469120	And I know, and there's all sorts
5469120	5471800	of socially worthy projects and business ideas
5471800	5475200	that have successfully fundraised in this way.
5475360	5479400	So there's actually been a debate about
5479400	5481640	whether this would be a good idea or a bad idea
5481640	5484400	or what the pros and cons of it are on equity grounds
5487080	5491040	on the participatoryeconomy.org website.
5492600	5493560	Because there's a lot of people
5493560	5495160	that are interested in this.
5495160	5500160	Sometimes crowdfunding basically allows the person
5501080	5506080	who has donated to get a share of whatever comes out of it.
5508680	5510200	So there's two kinds of crowdfunding.
5510200	5512480	One is it's basically, it's just a donation.
5513440	5515840	And the other is, no, you're actually,
5515840	5518960	in some sense, you're buying into the business.
5519800	5521920	And at some point you would get some reward
5521920	5523000	for having done that.
5523960	5525440	And those are two very different things
5525440	5527760	in terms of what the equity implications are.
5528640	5531480	It could also be implemented on a structural level,
5531480	5533640	because when I was thinking about crowdfunding,
5533640	5535080	it's not in the typical sense
5535080	5537600	that you would have to take some of your money
5537600	5541560	and put it into a crowdfunding project
5541560	5542400	or something like that.
5542400	5544480	But it could be implemented on a structural level
5544480	5549480	where each and everybody gets a certain amount of tokens
5550720	5552720	that you cannot spend for anything else,
5552720	5557400	that those are associated with some form of fund
5557400	5562400	for innovators who are kind of trying to test out new ideas
5563520	5564360	and stuff like that.
5564360	5567320	So this would be a slightly different type of scheme.
5567320	5569400	And one of the outputs for the people
5569400	5573040	who put in the tokens for a given project
5573040	5577000	could be that they might simply get the use value
5577000	5579920	that is being produced earlier than the others
5579920	5581440	or something like that.
5581440	5584280	But this is a sidetrack, I would say.
5584320	5586480	Yes, I mean, when I was thinking of research,
5586480	5590040	when I was thinking of Workers' Federations
5590040	5592760	having large research enterprises
5592760	5595040	that are affiliated with them,
5595040	5597040	I was thinking of them funding that.
5598640	5601520	And I was thinking the same thing on the consumer side.
5601520	5603800	On the other hand, you could basically have...
5605000	5607280	The tokens could be basically tokens
5607280	5611040	that individuals are saying, I want that research.
5611680	5614120	I'm putting my token toward that research.
5615040	5615880	Yeah.
5615880	5616720	Yeah.
5616720	5620040	And another question that I was asking myself
5620040	5623160	in terms of what you call user rights,
5623160	5628160	how do you distribute user rights over a given comments
5628680	5632520	so that whoever can make the best use of the comments
5632520	5635360	is actually allocated the right to use it?
5635360	5637520	Because this is a difficult question.
5637520	5639400	I mean, there might be many people
5640160	5644760	who propose to use a given comments that is there to use,
5644760	5648040	and it's difficult to decide who might actually get it.
5648040	5650360	This is the same subject as, well,
5650360	5652080	public versus private ownership.
5653200	5657160	So let's step back to sort of old socialist times.
5658080	5660800	The first thing that the old socialists used to say is,
5660800	5663080	well, the means of production need to be...
5664280	5666880	The means of production shouldn't be in private hands.
5667880	5671880	The means of production should be socially owned.
5673120	5674960	And what kind of means of production
5674960	5676080	were they thinking about?
5676080	5678720	I mean, they were thinking about the factories
5678720	5680520	and the machines and the factories.
5681360	5684000	They shouldn't belong to the capitalist.
5684000	5687480	They should belong to all of the workers collectively.
5688480	5690960	That means the economy still has to figure out
5690960	5695400	how to assign a particular factory or a particular machine
5695800	5697440	to be used by this group of workers
5697440	5698520	or that group of workers.
5698520	5701400	And that's what the plan supposedly does.
5701400	5704320	Well, I mean, that also applies to land.
5705600	5707320	I mean, land is like a machine.
5707320	5709160	You use land to grow food.
5711320	5712720	And in the Soviet Union, I mean,
5712720	5716920	I was thinking the other day in the early Soviet Union,
5719280	5721720	I mean, what actually produced the Russian Revolution
5721720	5724440	was when the peasants actually took over the land.
5724440	5726160	It was 80% of the population.
5726160	5730360	There's no Russian Revolution except the peasants say,
5730360	5732240	the feudal lords who used to own the land
5732240	5734360	and we worked on it as serfs
5734360	5736000	and then we became free to serfs
5736000	5738720	and we basically had to pay them rent.
5738720	5739920	We're taking it over.
5741080	5744760	And then they set up, sometimes they set up state farms.
5744760	5749440	That was the form in which the land is public was manifest.
5749440	5751400	Sometimes they set up collective farms,
5751400	5753680	which were somewhat different in terms of
5753680	5756360	how the land was handled on a collective farm
5756360	5757400	than a state farm.
5758920	5761320	But certainly we have a sort of a history
5761320	5764440	of socialist believe that that land
5764440	5767360	and those factory and those machines,
5767360	5771120	it's what I call part of the productive commons
5771120	5773760	and it belongs to everybody and nobody.
5775000	5779320	And the issue simply is figuring out
5779320	5781520	who gets user rights over it
5782520	5784200	on what sort of basis.
5785400	5786800	And that's what the plan does.
5786800	5790960	So if you look at our participatory planning process
5790960	5793040	and if you're a worker council
5793040	5798040	and you're proposing to produce so many tomatoes
5798280	5800280	and so many heads of lettuce,
5800280	5802520	then you're also saying, well, one of the inputs is
5802520	5805440	we want these many acres of lands, et cetera, et cetera.
5806320	5810120	And we don't want you to grow tomatoes on it
5810200	5812280	if it would be better for avocados.
5812280	5813840	And if there's another worker council
5813840	5816560	that is wanting to land for avocados,
5816560	5818280	then they're gonna put in a proposal saying,
5818280	5819280	we wanna use it.
5820520	5824640	So that's the importance of we wanna know
5824640	5827120	what the opportunity cost of using that land is
5827120	5828240	because we want it to go,
5828240	5830560	we want a system that will assign it
5830560	5832680	to whichever workers council
5832680	5834840	can make the most socially productive use of it.
5834840	5838400	And I think that's part of what the planning process
5838400	5840120	is actually doing.
5840120	5843840	Now, there's another part of the productive commons
5843840	5845520	that has been a lot trickier.
5846840	5850000	So there was the traditional ideas
5850000	5853000	of the machines in the factory
5853000	5854880	and that sort of extends to land.
5856360	5861040	But there's also that, I mean,
5861040	5863720	mainstream economists will call natural resources,
5863720	5865280	they call them natural capital.
5866200	5869560	So you have produce capital machines, buildings,
5869560	5873520	you have natural capital and then you have human capital.
5875840	5880160	And human capital is sort of my native talents
5880160	5882040	and my education and my training
5883640	5885520	is what gives a particular person
5885520	5887280	a certain amount of human capital.
5888280	5891360	Well, should that be socially owned?
5891360	5893960	Should we view that in the same way
5893960	5898240	that we view the machines and the factories
5898240	5900520	and the land and the natural capital
5900520	5903160	as it belongs to everybody and nobody?
5903160	5904360	No, it's me.
5906560	5907800	I mean, it's mine.
5909040	5910920	Well, how's that any different
5910920	5914240	from the way people used to think of this land is mine?
5914240	5915840	This machine is mine.
5919240	5921760	That's the part I think that sort of
5921760	5924280	both politically and philosophically
5924280	5927960	and personally and psychologically becomes more difficult
5927960	5930280	for people to think in the same terms.
5932040	5934200	We have argued that it's all the same.
5935320	5936920	And so we sort of said,
5936920	5939120	it's all part of the productive commons
5940760	5945320	and it doesn't belong to anybody or it belongs neither,
5945320	5948200	it belongs both to all of us and none of us.
5949200	5953360	And the question is simply how to use it
5953360	5958360	and how in a planning procedure to award user rights over it.
5963440	5965080	There's of course a debate about,
5965080	5967600	I mean, when you're thinking about compensation,
5967600	5971320	there's been a long debate among socialists
5971320	5974640	about whether, well, if I have more human capital
5975120	5978960	and therefore the social value of my contribution
5978960	5980840	when I work an hour is higher than yours,
5980840	5982200	then I deserve higher pay.
5985360	5986720	And then there are people who've argued,
5986720	5989840	no, that actually isn't, you don't deserve higher pay.
5989840	5993120	You deserve higher pay if you made greater sacrifices maybe,
5993120	5996760	but not simply because you have more human capital
5996760	5998200	than somebody else.
5998200	6001520	So those arguments have gone on forever amongst socialists.
6004760	6008800	And what it reduces to is whether or not human capital
6008800	6011560	is are we gonna now consider human capital
6011560	6013720	the same way we consider natural capital,
6013720	6016760	the same way we consider produce capital
6016760	6021400	as it belongs to all of us and none of us.
6021400	6025200	It's something we collectively in our generation
6025200	6028800	inherit from all those previous generations before us.
6029880	6031680	And that's how it should be treated.
6031680	6033640	And we wanna design an economic system
6033640	6035200	that treats it all that way.
6036520	6039240	And that's been our vision and that's been our argument.
6040160	6043360	But I know in terms of coming up,
6043360	6047520	I know that in terms of meeting opposition
6048520	6050600	from some fellow socialists
6050600	6053280	about whether or not they agree or don't agree
6053280	6056360	that this is an area of great disagreement.
6058960	6060040	And when you think about it,
6060040	6062400	of course we know it's an area of great disagreement.
6063040	6067720	It was hotly debated in the Soviet Union for 50 years
6067720	6069200	where there were time periods
6069200	6073240	when there were big bonuses given out to people,
6073240	6076160	to engineers and people, I mean, one of Stalin's,
6078200	6080640	in the early days, it was sort of,
6080640	6082360	well, everybody gets paid the same
6082360	6084760	and maybe we'll all argue about
6084760	6086440	everybody's gotta put in more effort
6086440	6087480	and we'll fight with each other
6087480	6090880	about you're slacking off and I, et cetera, et cetera.
6090920	6092240	But there was no sort of,
6092240	6095480	in the early days of the Russian revolution,
6096800	6098880	there wasn't strong support
6098880	6101560	for the more highly educated and the engineers
6101560	6103920	getting much higher pay scales.
6103920	6106640	Whereas at some point during the 30s and the 40s
6106640	6108280	and the 50s, that became,
6109880	6113600	Gorbachev finally sort of voiced
6113600	6117120	that as what socialism was.
6117120	6119560	He literally said that we,
6119560	6120960	people deserve to be paid
6120960	6123600	according to the value of their social contribution
6123600	6125320	and some people's social contribution
6125320	6127080	is objectively higher than other people
6127080	6129280	and it's perfectly fair that they be paid more
6129280	6130840	and they should be paid more.
6130840	6135000	Gorbachev finally arrived at the point of just saying,
6135000	6138200	that's what the, that's the justification.
6138200	6140400	We're doing it and we should be doing it.
6142000	6144560	Whereas I think that I would always have argued
6144560	6146520	against that as being fair
6146520	6148920	and I think many socialists throughout history
6148920	6151400	have also felt no, that isn't particularly fair.
6152360	6155760	And just to check back whether or not I do get it right.
6155760	6159480	So like very specifically on the question
6159480	6162520	of how it is being decided upon
6162520	6166920	who gets user rights over a given comments
6166920	6170160	and you already explained that your notion of the comments
6170160	6175160	is a very like enlarged version of the comments actually.
6176000	6178680	So the answer to the question
6178680	6181920	of how this is being decided upon
6181920	6186440	is again, this question of social benefit.
6186440	6190960	So whether or not a given resource
6190960	6193800	is actually being used in a way
6193800	6198800	so that the social benefit is higher than the social cost
6199520	6203000	and the way that this is being calculated
6203000	6206200	is along the lines of opportunity costs.
6206200	6207040	Do I get that right?
6207040	6207880	Just to check it out.
6207880	6211680	Yeah, I wrote an article where I talked about it as,
6213080	6216560	I talked about it as the productive commons
6216560	6218040	for modern times.
6218040	6220080	I think there was a time period
6220080	6222400	when socialists thought about the commons,
6222400	6225360	they just thought about the machines in the factory
6225360	6226200	and land.
6227040	6230760	And now what we, I mean, modern times requires us
6230760	6233600	to think about the productive column.
6233600	6236840	So I'll list everything that's in the productive commons.
6236840	6240560	It's those machines in the factories, just like always.
6240560	6242320	It's land.
6242320	6244800	It's any other natural resources,
6244800	6248280	including that big thing up there
6248280	6251160	that is storing all our greenhouse gases,
6251160	6254120	which is basically like a commons
6254120	6257200	that whenever you use it and exploit it,
6257880	6260640	it's something that we need to take account of.
6263440	6267200	I think that everything that mainstream economists
6267200	6270680	call human capital is part of the productive commons.
6271640	6275000	And technology is part of the productive commons.
6275000	6276920	And that's when we were talking about patent rights
6276920	6278200	and who gets to use it.
6279280	6281360	And then we were talking about it in the context
6281360	6283800	of sort of stimulating innovation.
6284800	6287240	Whatever clever ways we have come up
6287240	6289760	with making things in the past.
6289760	6292320	So all of that is part of what I simply call
6292320	6294360	the productive commons.
6294360	6299360	And it doesn't belong any more to one person than another.
6301560	6305880	But it's important that we want to allocate user rights
6305880	6310200	over it to whoever can make the most efficient use of it.
6311200	6315200	But nobody gets to reap the rewards personally
6317000	6319040	of the fact that they're using it.
6319040	6322120	So if we give the machines to the workers in this factory
6322120	6326000	because they can make the best use of that machine,
6326000	6327800	that doesn't mean the workers in this factory
6327800	6331120	get higher income than the workers in some other factory.
6332000	6335160	And here's the real hard dividing line.
6335240	6338240	So in our annual planning process,
6338240	6342240	we're going to come up with the estimates
6342240	6344960	of the opportunity cost of using an hour
6344960	6347880	of electrical engineering labor.
6349440	6351520	And we're going to come up with the opportunity cost
6351520	6353680	of using an hour of carpentry labor.
6353680	6355440	And we're going to come up with the opportunity cost
6355440	6358640	of using an hour of just ditch digging labor.
6358640	6360360	And they aren't going to be the same.
6362280	6364120	Now does that make sense?
6364960	6367640	Now does that mean that somebody in our economy
6367640	6370880	that digs ditches or works as an electrical engineer
6370880	6375200	or works as a carpenter is going to get paid higher wages?
6375200	6376640	And our answer is no.
6378280	6381560	That'll be depending on inside their worker council,
6381560	6384480	whatever procedures their fellow workers set up
6384480	6388920	to decide whether they're putting in extra effort,
6389800	6391400	working extra hours,
6392280	6396560	working under less favorable or desirable conditions.
6399400	6402880	So that's the way that we think there is,
6402880	6404720	we think it's a separate logic
6405920	6408600	for how you allocate user rights over things,
6408600	6412480	including different categories of labor that doesn't,
6412480	6413520	but that doesn't have to,
6413520	6414960	for different categories of labor,
6414960	6416800	it does not have to translate into
6416800	6419480	that's how we therefore pay people differently.
6420640	6423320	Which at a certain point in the early 1940s,
6423320	6427240	Stalin was just advocating
6434240	6436520	for those who were fortunate enough
6436520	6438400	to get the engineering degrees
6438400	6440360	and have those skilled kinds of labor
6440360	6442760	in the Soviet economy during that time period.
6443600	6446920	I know the early years of the Cuban revolution
6446920	6448760	and when Che Guevara was still around,
6448760	6450560	they were very clear on this point.
6453200	6455440	And the Cubans always had an attitude about it.
6455440	6459840	I mean, their attitude about it in the early years
6459840	6463600	in the Cuban revolution was we only have the resources
6463600	6467680	to send so many people to school to become doctors
6467680	6469040	or to become engineers.
6470040	6473080	And anybody that we sent to school doing that,
6473080	6474360	they're already lucky.
6475280	6477560	They're the ones that got the extra education
6477560	6480200	and we couldn't give it to everybody.
6480200	6481800	And they owe society.
6483520	6485720	So the whole idea that you were lucky
6485720	6488360	that you were the one that was trained to be a doctor,
6488360	6490760	we have every right to send you out to work
6490760	6493240	for five years in the countryside,
6493240	6495600	giving, making sure that little kids
6495600	6497400	don't die from dehydration.
6498200	6499840	I mean, that's fair.
6501040	6505160	The idea that you deserve to be paid 10 times more
6505160	6508480	than somebody who didn't get that extra education.
6508480	6510360	In the early years of the Cuban revolution,
6510360	6512520	there was a very broad consciousness.
6512520	6514240	I think there still is in Cuba
6515200	6517520	of a relatively healthy consciousness,
6517520	6519840	I would call it on this subject.
6519840	6524840	I think before we move on to the more long-term questions,
6525600	6528280	long-term questions, actually,
6528280	6532600	I think it would be important maybe in order to close
6532600	6537000	the case of the basic elements of Paragon
6537000	6539200	to take a closer look at some elements
6539200	6540600	we kind of touched upon,
6540600	6543480	but haven't yet really talked through.
6543480	6546800	One of those would be balanced job complexes
6546800	6551520	because this is actually a very important basic principle
6551520	6554640	within Paragon as well.
6555480	6559480	And we haven't actually laid it out in concrete terms,
6559480	6560400	I think.
6560400	6565400	So maybe could you explain what are balanced job complexes
6565440	6570440	and why do you think that they are a good idea to implement?
6570440	6573240	Okay, there's two different issues.
6573240	6577360	You can balance jobs in two respects.
6577360	6579800	One would be for empowerment
6579800	6581920	and the other would be for desirability
6581920	6583720	or undesirability, whatever.
6585440	6589360	So first, let's look at how it is
6589360	6592520	that most jobs look in capitalism.
6592520	6595080	We could also look and see how do most jobs look
6595080	6597440	in the centrally planned socialist economies too.
6598520	6602720	In both cases, what you find is that
6602720	6605480	a small percentage of a workplace
6606840	6611400	have jobs that consists of a number of tasks
6611400	6613640	and sort of approximately how many hours a week
6613640	6615720	you work in these different tasks.
6615720	6618320	These are tasks where you're sitting in on meetings,
6619400	6622360	where you're going over different options
6622360	6624440	for what might happen.
6624440	6628280	Or these would be tasks where you're just,
6628280	6631680	I used to work in steel mills in the summers
6631680	6633920	when I was going to college.
6633920	6636920	And they would throw us into the crews
6636920	6638560	where we would have to go out
6638560	6642240	and underneath the open hearth furnaces,
6644200	6648240	all of this sort of burnt coal ash would come down.
6648240	6651080	And at some point the tunnels would fill up
6651080	6652640	and you have to send somebody in there
6652640	6655800	to shovel it out into wheelbarrows.
6655800	6660800	Rote labor, not pleasant, nothing empowering about it.
6660960	6663680	It just made your muscles sore when you went home at night.
6663680	6667680	So in almost any capitalist workplace you go to
6667680	6672680	and I think in most of the centrally planned economies,
6672840	6677840	certainly by the second half of the 20th century,
6677880	6682280	what you're gonna find is you've got a small number of people
6682280	6684480	who do managerial type tasks.
6685600	6687600	And then you've got most of the people
6687600	6689520	just carrying out somebody's orders,
6689520	6691960	doing something that's more or less mind numbing.
6693720	6698720	Well, clearly some tasks empower people
6699680	6703720	to be both more knowledgeable about the kinds of decisions
6703720	6705600	that have to be made in enterprise
6706680	6709120	and to sort of have the skills and habits
6709120	6712520	to be effective in expressing their opinions on the subject.
6714200	6719000	So the whole idea that, well, we want our workers councils.
6721480	6723600	We're giving everybody one vote.
6723600	6727880	Ultimately, we're saying at a stockholders meeting
6728840	6730440	in a capitalist corporation,
6730440	6732120	ultimately you get as many votes
6732120	6733600	as you have shares of stock.
6735840	6739560	In a workers council, everybody gets one vote.
6739560	6743240	But if you have some people doing all of these empowering
6743240	6745840	tasks day in and out and you have other people
6745840	6750480	in the workplace doing these rote sort of mindless jobs
6750480	6755120	day in and day out, then clearly although they have
6755120	6759600	an equal right to vote in the meetings,
6761640	6763680	they aren't gonna arrive at those meetings
6763680	6767120	sort of equally empowered to be effective in the meetings.
6768160	6773080	This is something that, I mean, in Yugoslavia,
6774600	6777120	we had a 20, 30 year experience
6777120	6780120	with workers self-management in enterprises.
6780160	6785160	And one of the very discouraging trends
6785160	6787560	was that in the early years,
6787560	6790200	there was a lot more active participation
6790200	6792360	on the part of a much larger percentage
6792360	6794080	of workers in the enterprise.
6794080	6799080	And as time went on, all the sociological studies
6799080	6802880	about the activity of the participation declined over time.
6803760	6806360	And I think there was a reason for that,
6806360	6810760	that they didn't balance jobs for empowerment.
6810760	6813000	They made no particular effort to do that.
6813960	6817120	So if you really want what I would call
6817120	6821800	real workplace democracy rather than just formal,
6821800	6823880	everybody gets one vote democracy,
6824760	6826800	then there's a very strong argument
6826800	6830000	that I think socialists should want to see.
6830000	6835000	Job descriptions revised so that to the extent
6835280	6836800	that it's reasonable and possible,
6836800	6838880	you want to include empowering tasks
6838880	6840760	along with disempowering tasks
6840760	6843040	in everybody's job description.
6843040	6845360	And does that mean that in a hospital,
6845360	6848600	sometimes a surgeon might actually have to spend
6848600	6850400	some hours changing bedpans?
6850400	6851960	My answer is yes.
6853560	6855760	And then we can argue about whether that's
6855760	6859360	not a very inefficient use of that skilled surgeon's time.
6861000	6864280	But any case, so that's what the balancing
6864280	6865480	for empowerment about.
6865480	6867760	It's basically saying if you look at our,
6867760	6871600	if you look at both capitalism and state socialism,
6873520	6875720	really was a remarkable similarity
6875720	6879360	in terms of how jobs were structured
6879360	6881520	and the fact that some of them,
6881520	6883880	a small number of them were rather empowered,
6883880	6885880	had the effect of empowering the people
6885880	6887720	who carried out those tasks.
6887720	6891120	And for most people, the effect was to disempower you
6891160	6894920	in terms of your, in any case.
6894920	6897640	Now that's a little different from desirability.
6897640	6900520	So the argument in favor of empowering for desirability
6900520	6904000	is that's how you encourage and make sure
6904000	6908920	that you don't have an erosion of the exercise
6908920	6912240	of economic democracy in the workplaces.
6913240	6916080	Balancing for desirability is an equity issue.
6919000	6921000	And there is another way of taking care of that
6921840	6923040	and that is the worker's council.
6923040	6926600	So, I mean, where does that come from?
6926600	6931360	Well, why should somebody's job be remarkably,
6931360	6934640	why should somebody's job be much more unpleasant
6934640	6936320	than somebody else's job?
6936320	6938440	Where's the justice in that?
6938440	6940640	So you can put the question simply that way.
6943000	6946040	And my answer would be there is no justice in that
6946040	6947800	unless there was some compensation.
6948600	6952400	So that's where there is sort of an alternative way
6952400	6956160	to take care of the injustice if somebody's job
6956160	6959320	has a whole bunch of tasks that are really unpleasant
6959320	6961720	and somebody else's job never has any tasks
6961720	6964920	that are unpleasant, the changing bedpans.
6964920	6969920	In that case, you could compensate the person
6969920	6974920	that has the job that is less pleasant to perform.
6975600	6979600	And you could say that's part of why somebody
6979600	6981360	would deserve greater compensation.
6981360	6984000	So in that case, there's two ways of taking care of it.
6984000	6989000	Our actual proposal is, we basically propose
6989880	6992400	consciousness raising amongst workers
6992400	6995400	about these issues in their workplace.
6995400	6999160	And we propose that we think you should set up,
6999160	7002200	like we used to, originally we just called them
7002200	7003760	effort rating companies.
7003800	7005800	We just called them effort rating committees.
7005800	7007440	But we were thinking more along the lines
7007440	7010600	of sort of any differential sacrifice.
7010600	7013680	And we think you should set up procedures
7013680	7017680	for trying to balance the tasks and the time people
7017680	7019760	are spending in tasks so that you,
7019760	7022560	so that you don't have this terrible imbalance
7022560	7026520	in terms of the empowerment effects of work life.
7028800	7030680	But you obviously are gonna have to go about this
7030680	7031520	as you see fit.
7032520	7037040	So these are what I call injunctions and arguments.
7039000	7043800	But the bottom line is, nobody from the outside
7043800	7047720	is coming in and telling you how you do it.
7049800	7052200	And if push comes to shove and a workplace,
7052200	7054600	a bunch of workplace council and then a workers council
7054600	7056080	doesn't wanna do these things,
7057320	7061240	I would be very loathe to say somehow you get called up
7061240	7065880	before a tribunal and put on trial for it.
7065880	7068120	I mean, if you don't do them, you don't do them.
7070360	7073680	In our mind, they're part of what socialism should be like
7073680	7075640	and should be about.
7075640	7079760	But we're very libertarian in our anarchist tendencies
7079760	7082520	in terms of whether this is something that is imposed
7082520	7084560	or this is something that we are talking about
7084560	7086400	building a culture for.
7086920	7088880	Yeah, and I think at least for me,
7088880	7093880	the last statements are very important to me,
7094200	7097800	I have to say, because I'm not a big fan
7097800	7101800	of the effort-raiding committees, to be honest,
7101800	7106800	because I sense the real danger of this becoming real ugly
7108320	7111680	and creating some form of toxic workplace.
7111680	7113680	And I would very much advise
7114000	7116000	anyone to not go this road,
7116000	7118880	but I very much appreciate that within Paragon,
7118880	7122480	you give this kind of flexibility
7122480	7126480	in order to approach the things that you recommend
7126480	7129560	in the terms of, for example, balance,
7129560	7133040	job complexes or effort-raiding committees.
7133040	7136040	But if a worker council does have a different type
7136040	7139040	of culture within the given worker council
7139040	7140960	and wants to do things differently,
7141000	7143360	this is absolutely compatible with Paragon
7143360	7145080	as such, as I understand it.
7145080	7148480	Well, there's the largest actual experience
7148480	7153480	of a group of workplaces trying to apply these principles,
7154360	7157360	including, and in particular, the job balancing,
7159880	7162880	balancing for both empowerment and balancing for,
7162880	7165720	you know, for desirability and effort-raiding.
7167240	7169280	There was a lot of, you know,
7170240	7173000	there was a whole network of,
7173000	7176320	they were called the Mondragon, it was called the A-Zone,
7176320	7178720	and they were called the Mondragon,
7178720	7181960	not to be confused with the Mondragon cooperatives
7181960	7183480	in the Basque region of Spain.
7184360	7186080	And I'm not quite sure why they chose,
7186080	7189840	I think they might've chose the word Mondragon in Winnipeg
7189840	7191600	in sort of honor of that,
7193080	7195680	but they're very, very different.
7195680	7198760	And there was a coffee house, a restaurant,
7199880	7203080	a radio station, a bicycle repair,
7203960	7206560	sort of a delivery business.
7208280	7210240	And they all were in this sort of,
7211600	7214120	they all had offices in this sort of building
7214120	7216120	that they jointly had,
7216120	7220760	and they very self-consciously tried to operate
7220760	7224960	their collectives on the basis of paragon principles.
7226240	7227800	They did it for about 20 years.
7229760	7233240	And so I'm aware of debates and discussions
7233240	7234680	that went on amongst them.
7236360	7239720	One of the founders, Paul Burroughs,
7239720	7241320	has gone on to do some other things,
7241320	7242560	but he now is,
7243480	7246400	he's now been active back on the forum
7246400	7249640	on the participatoryeconomy.org website,
7249640	7252120	discussing exactly this thing.
7252120	7253800	Because it is one of the things
7253800	7256520	that has been most controversial.
7257520	7262520	And I can say that what Mondragon ended up doing
7264280	7266720	was not really trying to do
7266720	7270520	any sort of detailed effort rating.
7271960	7273960	They argued about it a lot.
7273960	7276200	It was quite controversial.
7276200	7280760	And they ended up saying,
7280760	7282800	no, it's gonna come down to hours.
7283640	7288640	And if there's a real problem with just,
7289240	7291400	you're not putting in effort,
7291400	7294840	then it's an issue of firing,
7294840	7296880	it's an issue of the rest of us saying,
7296880	7299080	this is just too detrimental to the rest of us.
7299080	7302640	You either have to ship up or you have to shape up
7302640	7305560	or you really shouldn't be working here anymore.
7305560	7309000	Rather than sort of having an effort rating committee
7309000	7312720	where at the end of every six months or so.
7313640	7314960	So I know that's what they came up with.
7316240	7320640	I am sure that, here's my dilemma.
7320640	7322120	My dilemma is the following.
7323200	7325880	Those of us who are even talking about it,
7325880	7330560	we've already decided that we're leftists and we're socialists.
7331520	7335720	And therefore, we don't think it should be necessary
7335720	7339040	to get into this kind of invidious comparisons.
7340040	7344240	And we would just find it toxic.
7346360	7348400	And my answer to all of us is I have two,
7348400	7350600	and I have two things to say about that.
7350600	7354800	Just like you, when I go to search for a worker's council
7354800	7357200	to work for in a participatory economy,
7358040	7361480	I will look for one that adopts that attitude
7361480	7362560	toward effort rating.
7365160	7368000	Because that'll make me happiest there.
7368000	7371480	I mean, one of the things that people should look at,
7371480	7373680	I mean, people do this in capitalism.
7373680	7375480	They look to see, well, what's your pay structure
7375480	7377840	and how are you gonna, when can I first put in
7377840	7380040	for a promotion?
7381320	7384560	So I think one of the things that people will sensibly look
7384560	7387240	at in a participatory economy when they decide
7387240	7389200	where they want to apply to a workplace is
7389200	7392240	to look and see what is the workplace's procedures
7392240	7394560	in this regard or the ones I would like
7394560	7397000	or the ones I would feel comfortable with or not.
7397000	7398480	But here's my dilemma.
7398480	7401440	I talk to people who would not be comfortable
7402520	7405720	in a work environment where they think
7405720	7407680	that people who don't work as hard
7409360	7411960	are gonna get just as rewarded as they are.
7411960	7415160	And I know that they would want some sort of procedures
7415160	7420160	where slackers would be identified by fellow workers
7420960	7425680	and would be told, look, it's okay
7425680	7427280	if you don't wanna work as hard.
7428400	7430640	But please recognize that that means
7430640	7432840	you shouldn't be rewarded quite as much.
7434320	7436160	So that's another issue.
7436160	7438040	And the usual way of handling this,
7438040	7439440	I mean, the way it was always handled
7439440	7442720	in the Soviet Union was everybody should be working
7442720	7444480	harder than anybody can imagine.
7447120	7452120	And I mean, I grew up as an, I grew up
7452600	7456440	as enough of a hippie to know that is insane.
7457520	7458840	That's not a good life.
7460360	7464600	So there's nothing wrong with somebody saying,
7464600	7467200	hey, you wanna go out there and bust your hump?
7467200	7468760	That's fine.
7468760	7470080	I don't have to do that.
7470080	7472320	I don't wanna, I don't choose to do that.
7473200	7476920	On the other hand, I think one should concede
7476920	7479960	that if somebody else is making more sacrifices
7479960	7484320	then they deserve some degree of extra compensation
7484320	7486440	that's commensurate with that.
7486440	7488920	And it is my personal choice.
7488920	7490480	So I wanna give people the,
7490480	7493560	I wanna preserve personal choice
7493560	7496520	over how much effort people put into work.
7498600	7500840	But I think there's a responsible way to do that,
7500840	7505840	which is I choose more, I mean, we know there's a sort
7505920	7508280	of choose between leisure and income,
7508320	7510440	who we think of it as in terms of hours.
7510440	7513560	You can also choose between leisurely pace of work
7513560	7515080	and income.
7515080	7517040	There's no reason people shouldn't make,
7517040	7519280	people should have the right to choose that.
7519280	7521000	They make that choice for themselves.
7521000	7522400	Why not?
7522400	7525120	There's nothing socially irresponsible about saying
7525120	7527160	I want a more leisurely pace of work,
7528440	7530240	but my more leisurely pace of work,
7530240	7534200	I think basically entitles me to what I'm saying is
7534200	7536440	I want that more leisurely pace of work.
7536440	7539280	And yes, I accept somewhat less compensation
7539280	7542800	for the fact that it's not as big a sacrifice
7542800	7544200	as somebody else is making.
7545440	7548000	So that's where that all has landed.
7548000	7551160	In the end, we leave it up to workers councils.
7551160	7555080	We recommend that people take that into consideration.
7555080	7557440	When you decide where to apply to work,
7557440	7559400	you wanna go to work someplace
7559400	7561280	where they have the same values on that,
7561280	7564120	where they've come to the same set of values on that subject
7564120	7566800	that you feel that you're comfortable with.
7567920	7570480	But I do know that there are people out there
7570480	7572920	who are very loathe to think that this system
7572920	7575520	would be a good system that they would be happy in.
7575520	7578360	If they imagine themselves working in a place
7578360	7581720	where they work hard and other people don't,
7583120	7584800	and the other people get away with it
7584800	7586720	and get paid the same as them.
7586720	7590560	And they find that something, I don't like that system.
7590560	7593320	And I think there's a point to be made there too.
7594320	7596280	I also think there's a real bias.
7596280	7598480	Those of us who even talk about this
7598480	7603400	clearly are more inclined to don't wanna get into it.
7603400	7604920	People will be responsible.
7604920	7606600	And if they're really irresponsible,
7606600	7610280	then you admonish them in some sort of way.
7610280	7612280	You give them a warning and finally you just say,
7612280	7614080	well, you just don't wanna,
7614080	7616040	the rest of us don't wanna work with you.
7616040	7617880	But I think that there's a real,
7617880	7621680	I think that leftists are predictably farther
7621680	7624360	in that direction than your average person out there
7624360	7626080	in the population that we talk to
7626080	7628160	about different economic systems.
7628160	7631560	Cause I know this reaction to the students in my classes.
7631560	7633800	Cause students in my classes are basically
7633800	7636560	the average US population in some sense.
7636560	7639720	They're, a tiny percentage of them are leftists.
7641520	7645120	And I know from their reaction over the years,
7646920	7649840	they find it comforting that there'd be procedures
7649840	7653000	to distinguish between people who are working hard
7653000	7654400	and people who aren't.
7654400	7658600	Yeah, I think I subsumed this also somehow
7658600	7660360	under the question of transition,
7660360	7662480	because the way that you approach it
7662480	7665880	by providing a plurality of approaches
7665880	7670880	to different people who might be in a different
7671560	7674520	state of mind towards these questions
7674520	7679520	so that they can build it in a way that works for them
7679920	7680920	for the moment.
7680920	7685600	I mean, this also includes some danger, of course,
7685600	7689400	in the sense that it might lead to structures
7689400	7693040	that reproduce this kind of thinking
7693040	7694800	that you just described from your students,
7694800	7698640	this kind of like a bit greedy and competitive type
7698640	7702240	of behavior of thinking about one another.
7702240	7705480	And there's this danger of like reproducing this
7705480	7708880	by producing institutions and structures
7708880	7713840	within a given workers council that, as I said,
7713840	7715920	produces this kind of thinking as well.
7715920	7719800	But as I said, I absolutely appreciate this plurality
7719800	7724800	and my vote would go out for not like going down the road
7726400	7728840	of effort-raiding committees.
7728840	7731920	And also in terms of sacrifice and effort,
7731920	7734520	I find it very difficult to really evaluate
7734520	7738280	whether or not someone is putting in effort or not,
7738280	7741840	because this could look very differently
7741840	7743920	for a different type of person.
7743920	7746480	And at some point within your newest book,
7746480	7750480	you also write, but are people equally able to sacrifice
7750480	7752960	or is it easier for some to make sacrifices
7752960	7755800	than it is for others, just as it is easier
7755800	7758960	for some to perform difficult and valuable physical
7758960	7761840	or mental tasks than it is for others?
7761840	7764800	And then you state questions such as these make me happy.
7764800	7766320	I'm not a philosopher.
7766320	7769840	What can one say except perhaps, end quote.
7769840	7774520	And I would add to this, perhaps I would say for sure,
7774520	7777920	I'm quite sure that it is actually impossible
7777920	7781000	to really evaluate whether someone is putting in effort
7781000	7784920	and not, and to some people it comes more naturally
7784920	7787160	at different things and to others not.
7787160	7790200	So I would actually be kind of skeptical,
7790200	7794240	but as I said, I highly appreciate this flexibility
7794280	7796280	within your approach.
7796280	7797280	So-
7797280	7799080	There's actually a very active debate
7799080	7803400	amongst the collective that manages the,
7803400	7804920	actually one of the two brothers
7804920	7808480	who are the most active managers of the website.
7810480	7813240	Jason raised that on the discussion forum
7813240	7815680	and said that he thinks that there's a discussion
7815680	7817920	about whether we should stop using the word effort
7817920	7819480	in this regard.
7819480	7823040	Yeah, but it's not an easy issue.
7823080	7825120	It's not an easy issue.
7825120	7829000	And it is one that people care tremendously about.
7830360	7831960	And it's also one where you don't,
7831960	7834240	it's also one where, I mean, when we're starting
7834240	7837560	to talk about opportunity costs and social costs,
7837560	7840960	and whether a planning mechanism will do this or that,
7840960	7843800	well, I mean, there it requires some expertise.
7843800	7846800	This isn't any subject that anybody feels
7846800	7849120	requires any expertise they don't have,
7850080	7855080	which I always appreciate a subject where everybody thinks
7855360	7858920	that they are equally equipped to argue and debate,
7858920	7862200	and their view is just as valid as anybody else.
7862200	7865040	I think it's lucky when we have a subject
7865040	7867080	where everybody thinks that way about it.
7869000	7871040	And I think this is one of those subjects.
7871040	7872880	Everybody has a very firm opinion
7872880	7874680	about what they think is fair and not fair
7874680	7876560	in terms of economic compensation.
7877880	7878920	Interesting.
7879800	7882320	One question that I have in the back of my mind
7882320	7885240	all of the time when you're talking about
7885240	7888640	like the ways in which these workers councils
7888640	7890760	are organized internally,
7890760	7895760	how you might achieve self-management and so on and so forth
7896360	7897920	is the question of scaling.
7897920	7902920	So how big can these councils actually become
7903280	7906640	in order to stay true to these principles
7906640	7909440	that you would like to see being enacted
7909440	7911680	within these worker councils?
7911680	7914480	Because people who have experiences
7914480	7916640	with self-organized structures,
7916640	7921240	they might know that this is very much difficult.
7921240	7923760	It's very, very difficult to achieve
7923760	7926520	like organizations of scale
7926520	7931520	that are actually really true to principles
7931600	7933840	that Perikan tries to promote.
7934480	7938080	So how do you think about this question of scale?
7939720	7942640	The simple answer is we're agnostic on that subject.
7943880	7946200	But that doesn't mean,
7946200	7948160	there seem to be some things
7948160	7952840	that clearly the smaller the workers council,
7953880	7957080	the easier it is for people,
7957080	7960240	for everybody to participate in all aspects.
7960240	7962760	So you can ask yourself,
7962760	7965160	is there an optimal size
7965160	7967400	just in terms of how would
7967400	7970640	participatory democratic decision-making procedures
7970640	7972000	function best?
7974680	7979040	Obviously from a technology production side,
7979040	7981080	there's also issues about scale.
7982400	7984920	And here there's a useful difference.
7984920	7989920	I mean, economists talk about true economies of scale,
7990760	7992120	which can be distinguished
7992120	7995800	from financial economies of scale.
7997320	8000960	So in a capitalist economy,
8000960	8003920	there are frequently advantages of being larger,
8003920	8006680	like being an oligopoly or a monopoly even.
8008120	8011360	Not necessarily because the technology dictates it.
8012800	8016320	So we wouldn't want workers councils
8016320	8021120	to become large for what in capitalism
8021120	8023680	would be financial economies of scale reasons.
8023680	8026640	But in terms of social costs
8026640	8028600	and lowest social cost of production,
8028600	8031400	there are true economies of scale
8033480	8037200	where probably the efficient size
8037200	8041280	for a workers council producing steel
8041280	8044720	is different from the efficient size
8044720	8049200	for a workers council that's a haircut salon.
8049200	8052440	So when I said we're agnostic,
8052440	8054720	we just, we recognize all that.
8056560	8058080	And we don't think, I mean,
8058080	8060360	so suppose you have a workers council
8060360	8063760	where true economies of scale are significant.
8063760	8066040	And so we're really talking about an enterprise
8066040	8071040	that makes sense that has a couple of thousand members.
8072000	8075720	Well, then you clearly would have to sort of,
8075720	8077840	you're going to have different divisions.
8078720	8080840	I mean, something that large is going to have different,
8080840	8084560	I mean, in a steel mill, there was the blast furnace,
8085520	8087880	there's the open hearth furnace,
8087880	8089840	there's the warehouses,
8089840	8093320	there's the sheet metal cutting places.
8093320	8095640	So there's all these sort of divisions.
8095640	8098520	And in a large enterprise,
8098520	8103520	you would want to have sort of sub worker councils,
8104240	8105760	for the different divisions.
8105760	8109480	There's a whole bunch of decisions in the blast furnace area
8109480	8113360	that really don't affect the rest of the plant that much.
8113360	8116320	But it seems like that, I mean, so that is our approach.
8116320	8119920	That would be the sensible way to approach that.
8121360	8124400	The only thing that should not come into play
8124400	8127000	are in capitalist economies,
8127320	8128800	financial economies of scale,
8128800	8133800	sometimes give you extra market power advantages.
8134760	8136720	And that's why a firm will get that big.
8136720	8141720	And certainly, and we don't think that any workers council,
8145720	8148960	Mondragon set up operations in China.
8150360	8153600	And the Chinese operation was not self-managed
8153960	8157680	by Chinese workers at the Mondragon place in China.
8159120	8164120	So that's for both, that you can't have.
8167680	8168520	So you're not, I mean,
8168520	8172520	a lot of the world's large corporations are now global.
8172520	8175200	And so we're not talking about that at all.
8175200	8176600	None of these worker councils
8176600	8179600	are operating outside of the country.
8180600	8183960	In general, so there would not be any-
8183960	8186680	Well, they can export, they can import.
8186680	8188400	I mean, there's a chapter in the last,
8188400	8191120	in democratic economic planning
8191120	8194480	that addresses the sort of new practical issue.
8195960	8200400	There was a point in time when socialists thought that
8200400	8203920	when socialism finally came to power any place,
8203920	8206800	the idea was gonna be so obviously wonderful
8206800	8209120	that the workers were gonna revolt every place
8209640	8212560	and we were gonna have socialism everywhere.
8212560	8216400	Even Lenin thought there were gonna be revolutions
8216400	8218360	in Germany and Europe,
8218360	8222240	and that they weren't gonna have an isolated Soviet Union.
8222240	8224560	And Trotskyists for a long time argued
8224560	8228040	that you really can't have socialism in one country.
8228040	8229680	Well, it's apparent now
8229680	8232560	that if we can't have socialism in one country at a time,
8232560	8233640	we're never gonna have it,
8233640	8236880	because at this point in the 20th century,
8236880	8239560	it's very clear to me that it's highly unlikely
8239560	8240880	that we aren't gonna have,
8242520	8244720	who knows what country it's going to be,
8244720	8248240	but countries are gonna try and become socialist
8248240	8250560	in a world where there are still huge differences
8250560	8252760	in levels of economic development
8252760	8255520	and where a lot of the countries are capitalist countries
8255520	8256840	that they have to interact with.
8256840	8259200	And then the question is, how do you interact?
8259200	8261640	So we finally address that in the most recent book,
8261640	8263400	we'd never talked about it before,
8264360	8267400	and sort of proposed how could a socialist,
8267400	8269560	a country with a socialist economy
8269560	8271360	take part in international trade
8271360	8272960	in a way that was beneficial to them,
8272960	8275760	but didn't violate their fundamental principles
8275760	8279240	in some way that eroded the sort of moral
8279240	8282040	and political glue that held their system together.
8283840	8284840	And we basically said,
8284840	8286120	the one thing that's ruled out
8286120	8287600	is direct foreign investment.
8289000	8290960	You can't allow a capitalist firm coming
8290960	8293200	and come into a participatory economy
8294000	8294840	and set up a capitalist,
8294840	8296520	engage in direct foreign investment,
8296520	8300360	run as a capitalist firm inside the socialist economy.
8300360	8302240	And we said, we don't think workers councils
8302240	8303960	in the socialist economy
8303960	8307640	can basically do direct foreign investment abroad.
8307640	8310760	But we do think that there's no reason
8310760	8312240	that a participatory economy
8312240	8314280	couldn't trade with the rest of the world,
8315200	8317440	including trading with capitalist countries
8317440	8320960	and including taking into account dramatic differences
8320960	8322600	in levels of economic development
8322600	8324200	in terms of the terms of trade.
8326000	8328080	And even international financial investment
8328080	8330240	is something we think is possible
8330240	8334800	for a participatory economy to engage in.
8334800	8336520	And a participatory economy could engage
8336520	8338520	in international financial investment,
8338520	8340440	both outgoing and ingoing.
8340440	8343560	It's a question of how you treat the interest rate.
8344440	8345600	And with certain partners,
8345600	8347920	you have to treat the interest rate differently.
8347920	8349520	But that's not something that wasn't discussed.
8349520	8351120	I mean, there was a huge discussion
8351600	8354680	in Cuba used to lecture the Soviet Union
8354680	8356880	and the Eastern European economies
8356880	8359160	about the morality of the difference
8359160	8361640	between being a lesser developed country
8361640	8363480	and a more developed country.
8363480	8365680	I mean, Che Guevara was famous for just saying,
8365680	8368440	well, we assume that your socialist principles
8370200	8371760	will help you understand
8371760	8374640	why you should afford favorable terms of trade
8374640	8377920	towards your brother socialist Cuban economy.
8377920	8382680	Now, to some extent, the Soviet Union did do that,
8382680	8386640	but more for geopolitical purposes
8386640	8388800	than commitments to socialist principles.
8388800	8390800	But in any case, this isn't something
8390800	8392560	that hasn't been discussed before.
8394080	8398400	But I do think that amongst socialist in 2020,
8398400	8400840	that discussion now has to be,
8400840	8403400	we now have a new perspective realism
8403400	8407560	about how socialism will eventually come to the world.
8407560	8409520	It'll come a little here and a little there.
8409520	8410920	And there's a long period of time
8410920	8413360	where you have to have some sensible answers
8413360	8416320	to how do those countries interact and economic,
8416320	8420920	how do they engage in economic interactions
8420920	8421880	with other countries?
8421880	8424040	You've got to have a more sensible discussion of that
8424040	8425440	than we've ever had before.
8425440	8430440	That was our show for today.
