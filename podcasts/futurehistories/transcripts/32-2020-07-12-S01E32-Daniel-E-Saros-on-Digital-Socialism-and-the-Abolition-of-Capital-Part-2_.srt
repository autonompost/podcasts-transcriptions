00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross, and what you are about to hear is the second part of an in-depth

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:13,460
interview that I did with Daniel E. Saros on digital socialism and the abolition of capital.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,480
We are about to dive in even deeper into Dan's proposal for a socialist mode of production with its own

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
socialist laws of motion, all of which he describes in great detail in his book

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Information Technology and Socialist Construction, The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,800
If you did not listen to the first part of the interview, then I highly recommend that you do so.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Not only because it's super interesting, but also because today's episode kind of builds on the last one.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I wanted to point the German-speaking audience to another episode of Future Histories that is concerned with the question of a socialist planned economy.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
And that is episode 19 with Jan-Philippe Dabrich.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,800
And I wanted to guide all of your attention towards a book that I believe to be a fruitful, if not necessary,

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:15,800
complementary read-to-dance book, and that is Refiguring Revolution, A Critical Theory of Social Transformation by Eva von Redeker,

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,800
translated from German by Lucy Duggan. I hope I'm pronouncing this right, Lucy.

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Sorry if not. You'll find the link to the introduction of Eva's book in the show notes.

14
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,800
And I mentioned this book because Information Technology and Socialist Construction, so dance book,

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
is concerned with answering a specific question.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,800
And that is actually still the question that had been asked in the historical socialist calculation debate.

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Can there be an intrinsically socialist mode of production that organizes its economy around autonomous socialist laws of motion without the need for markets?

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,800
However, we do indeed need a revolution in order to get into the position of implementing such a proposal in the first place.

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,800
And luckily, Eva von Redeker wrote a book about what this actually means, a revolution.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:23,800
If we turn away from this idea of a revolution as this one defining moment where the powers that be are overthrown and everything changes all of a sudden,

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,800
but instead look towards an idea of revolution as a praxis and as a process.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,800
And this is why I do believe this to be a great complementary read-to-dance book.

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:43,800
And I am very much looking forward to talking to her soon for future histories. I'll keep you updated.

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Before we finally get to the interview, thanks a lot to Kai for your support on Patreon and thanks to Bernhard for your donation.

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:03,800
But now, please enjoy the second part of the interview with Daniel E. Seros on digital socialism and the abolition of capital.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:16,800
OK, so maybe let me summarize a bit because I think this is, of course, a lot to take in for the listeners as well.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
All at once, the different layers and different approaches within the proposal.

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,800
There is this general catalog, which could be seen as some kind of socialist Amazon.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Let's say it's a huge catalog of use values, goods or services where I can consume by placing my use value,

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,800
the one that I want to purchase within my needs profile, my personal needs profile.

31
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I would have to go to work in order to get credits.

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,800
So that's just one of the things that is being expected of me.

33
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
I would have to go to work.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:00,800
But within this work, I'm organized in a democratic way in a workers council that everybody who's working at this socialist enterprise is engaged in.

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,800
So this will be organized very, very differently from from how it is being done today.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,800
It would be some kind of democratic economy actually on on every layer possible.

37
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:24,800
So then there are incentives in place within the system for me to make a plan of what use values, again, goods or services,

38
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I probably will consume next month, for example.

39
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,800
And if I plan good and indeed purchase most of the things that I placed within my needs profile,

40
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I am eligible for a bonus because I through communicating my needs early on,

41
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I helped with with the planning of the whole economy and made it easier for everybody.

42
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I will still be able to purchase items I did not plan for.

43
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I think that's very important to say, but it's just better for me and for everybody else, as I said,

44
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:10,800
for the for the functioning of the economy if I try to plan as good as possible and think ahead a bit.

45
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,800
And so then the products are being produced based on me registering my needs within the general catalog.

46
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,800
But there's a crucial question that comes up for me that I think I did not yet fully understand,

47
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:33,800
because how is the information of me ordering, let's say, 20 packages of milk being translated into points?

48
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
It cannot be just the quantity of 20 of 20 packages of milk.

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,800
So it's 20 points because if I ordered 20 cars, then this this would, of course, be a whole different kind of thing.

50
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:00,800
So there must be some kind of mechanism in place to translate my needs into points that has some kind of base in how many resources actually went into the production of this good.

51
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,800
So how is this being managed? That was a huge question for me.

52
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Well, each use value would have a base unit, I guess.

53
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:23,800
So if we're talking about one package, you said one package of milk that, for example, you could select that place it in your needs profile, depending on where you place it.

54
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,800
That'll determine how many points are assigned to it.

55
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,800
So if you place it higher, more points would be assigned to it.

56
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
And if you place it lower, fewer points would be assigned to it.

57
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:43,800
You could put in a whole block of use values, 20 packages, like you said, and you could arrange those consecutively in the profile or you could spread them out.

58
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,800
If some of them you don't feel like you need quite as much, you would rank them lower, others higher.

59
00:06:50,800 --> 00:07:05,800
So the Workers' Council that posted that use value in the universal catalog, general catalog, would be notified of the points that it can then use to acquire inputs to produce that use value.

60
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Yeah, go ahead.

61
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:19,800
As far as I understood it, at the end, the points will be communicated throughout the system from the registering of my need in the general catalog.

62
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:30,800
The Workers' Council will get a certain amount of points that it will then use to buy inputs in order to produce the product.

63
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,800
And this will go on and on and communicate throughout the system up until the resource of oil or wood and stuff like that.

64
00:07:39,800 --> 00:08:00,800
But if the weight that is communicated through me registering my need in the needs profile is quantified only by how many items I purchased and where I positioned it in the needs profile,

65
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:09,800
then it does not communicate how much resources went into the production of that given use value.

66
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Are you saying the consumers need that information?

67
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Well, the whole system needs this information in order to be termed rational.

68
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Because otherwise there would be the chance of excess production where the Workers' Councils, if they just react to the needs of the people and the needs are translated into points,

69
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:48,800
but not in a way that is anyway related to how much resources are put in, then there's a discrepancy there.

70
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Well, you've asked an excellent question here.

71
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:07,800
First, I think this situation is somewhat unlikely to arise because much of what we observe in terms of relative valuations in the marketplace and capitalist societies is likely to reproduce itself in a needs-based socialist society.

72
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:15,800
So that is a package of milk will be ranked much lower and have fewer points assigned to it in most needs profiles.

73
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,800
But let's suppose for the sake of argument that the use values do have a similar ranking for some reason.

74
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:34,800
In that case, the Workers' Council that posted milk, for example, would receive more resources than it needs in the point allocation process,

75
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:43,800
and it can virtually return the inputs during the point allocation period if it's receiving more than it needs to meet the current needs.

76
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Once the current needs are addressed, however, this process can be repeated for the allocation of inputs for investment purposes.

77
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Investment could mean expansion in new facilities.

78
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:05,800
And if milk is valued as highly than such expansion for the purpose of increasing the amount of milk produced might be a logical use of this large amount of resources.

79
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Resources could also be used for product development and innovation, which might also be a good use for them.

80
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Even so, if the Workers' Council believes it's receiving too many resources beyond even what it can productively use for investment,

81
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:29,800
it does have the option to virtually return the inputs during the point allocation process before it actually receives those inputs.

82
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Finally, let's suppose that all these adjustment factors that I've described fail,

83
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:44,800
and the Workers' Council that produces milk decides to use its large amount of points to acquire many more resources than it will use productively.

84
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:53,800
And then at the same time, let's suppose that a Workers' Council that produces automobiles ends up with far fewer resources to meet the current needs.

85
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,800
And so this could happen, to come back to your initial question,

86
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,800
this could happen when automobiles and milk are ranked at the same level in the needs profiles.

87
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,800
It might lead to far too many resources being devoted to milk production, not enough to automobiles.

88
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,800
In this case, the Workers' Council that sells the automobiles,

89
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,800
it will be producing too few automobiles because it doesn't have sufficient resources.

90
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,800
And so it's going to raise their prices and credits because the general rule for pricing in the socialist society

91
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,800
is to aim for the steady and complete sale of automobiles during the point allocation period.

92
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,800
So because they don't have that many automobiles and there are a lot of consumers wanting to buy these,

93
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,800
that's going to cause the Workers' Council raise those prices.

94
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,800
So the rise in prices, of course, is going to frustrate the consumers.

95
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Some will not be able to make the purchase at all.

96
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,800
And so those consumers will then raise automobiles in their needs profiles relative to milk.

97
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
And the Workers' Council produces automobiles will gain points.

98
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:14,800
So this process should continue until enough resources are devoted to automobile production

99
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
that prices for automobiles begin to fall.

100
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,800
And so in this way, I think the system will automatically work to correct this imbalance.

101
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,800
But it may take time. But just like in a capitalist society,

102
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,800
it takes time to shift resources from one industry to another in response to changes in consumer preferences.

103
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
That's a very interesting answer.

104
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,800
And I think it relates to a kind of even bigger question.

105
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Since you do not have, as it is in a capitalist society, one unit of account, such as money,

106
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:03,800
you come into a position where you kind of need to establish some kind of balance between credits

107
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
on the one hand and points on the other.

108
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,800
So the underlying assumption, as you just explained,

109
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,800
it is kind of that that through these different mechanisms of pricing,

110
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:28,800
ranking within the needs profiles and the question of how many resources can be used in general

111
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,800
in order to give away points established through the Council of Scientists.

112
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:44,800
These are the different elements that are thought of bringing about some kind of balance within the system.

113
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Do I get that right?

114
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes, I think you've actually hit on a very important point.

115
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,800
And it's something I haven't mentioned previously in the interview.

116
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,800
That is that it is a moneyless economy that we're talking about.

117
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,800
There is no money, not in the way that we know it.

118
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,800
The points don't have, I mean, this is a minor point, really.

119
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
The points do not have any physical substance to them.

120
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
They're simply electronic.

121
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,800
But more than that, points aren't spent and received by someone else.

122
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,800
It's simply a signal that's communicated from one worker's council to another,

123
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
and that is then used to acquire inputs.

124
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,800
So there's no money involved in the allocation of means of production to different worker's councils.

125
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Now, there are credits, at least in the socialist phase,

126
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,800
although in the higher phase of communism, the communist phase, as I'm calling it,

127
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800
there aren't even credits because at that stage,

128
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,800
people use their points from their needs profiles, consumers do, in order to acquire use values,

129
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,800
because the distribution principle at that point is to each according to his or her need.

130
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
So even the socialist credits go away.

131
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,800
But in the lower phase of communism, in the socialist phase,

132
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,800
the credits do seem to resemble money because use values have a price.

133
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Credits are received by workers for their work,

134
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,800
and they receive credits for bonuses when they've registered their needs and then made those purchases.

135
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
So those credits are used to acquire use values.

136
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Now, that appears to be money, but the major difference there is that the credits,

137
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
when they're received by the worker's councils that sell those use values,

138
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,800
they don't use those credits for any purpose.

139
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Those credits actually, they vanish.

140
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
They don't persist in any form.

141
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
They're not spent again.

142
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
That's how the system is set up.

143
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,800
This is an important point because when credits are being distributed to workers

144
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
and to consumers in the form of bonuses,

145
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
that increase in the amount of credits in the system could be inflationary,

146
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
could lead to hyperinflation, in fact.

147
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Once they're spent, however, because they cease to exist,

148
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,800
that leads to an automatic reduction in the total amount of credits

149
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,800
that are out there in circulation or not in circulation, but in people's hands.

150
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,800
And so there's an automatic sort of way to control this total supply of credits.

151
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,800
And it prevents hyperinflation and or inflation from really developing.

152
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,800
So the way I've described the use of points in the system, the use of credits,

153
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
it's very different from money.

154
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,800
And yet there's still a logic to the system that allows for the rational allocation of inputs

155
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,800
and I think the rational distribution of use values to consumers.

156
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,800
OK, just to make it super safe that I got that right,

157
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,800
the elements that serve primarily to guarantee this economic rationality

158
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,800
would be on the one hand the price and on the other hand,

159
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,800
how the consumers rank their needs within their needs profiles.

160
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Because I think my confusion from earlier about the points

161
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
was addressing a question that I had on how the worker councils,

162
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,800
how the workers councils would be incentivized to use their resources,

163
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,800
their scarce resources of nature in an efficient way,

164
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
how that would be established.

165
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,800
And as far as I understand it now, I think you say that the answer to this

166
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,800
would be that they would be incentivized to use their resources efficiently

167
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
since there's some kind of price pressure coming from the consumers as well.

168
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
And if they just act recklessly with the resources,

169
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,800
with the points that they are being allocated,

170
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
then this will feed back into the system.

171
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,800
And by that you have some feedback circles that are both

172
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,800
communicating the necessary information on what is being scarce

173
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,800
and a way to avoid non-efficient use of scarce resources.

174
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Do I get that right?

175
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Yes, I think that's right.

176
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I think the one thing I might add is that

177
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,800
what I would regard as efficiency in this kind of a system

178
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,800
isn't really the same as what we consider efficiency in a capitalist system.

179
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,800
So even though there's a rationality to it in the way that resources are allocated,

180
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,800
I don't think that the system is set up to pressure workers

181
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,800
to work as long and as hard as possible.

182
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:02,800
I think there's space for other considerations

183
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,800
that would allow workers to take into account the speed of work,

184
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,800
the nature of their work, and not let efficiency in the capitalist sense

185
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
be the only sort of value driving what they do.

186
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,800
But it still involves rationality in terms of clear rules

187
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,800
for the distribution of the inputs, the means of production,

188
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
and then also the final use values.

189
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm so glad that you say that because I'm actually split between a dual role here

190
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,800
as an advocatus diavoli on the one side,

191
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,800
where I try to imagine the arguments that critics will bring up

192
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
and they will ask for economic rationality.

193
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,800
And on the other side, of course, I totally advocate for different ideas of rationality

194
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,800
when it comes to what this means within, in this case, a socialist mode of production.

195
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,800
And actually, I thought of two ways how to address these as well,

196
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,800
because you could easily, within the needs, within the general catalog,

197
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,800
you could easily put in other factors that will be taken into consideration

198
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,800
by the consumers when deciding up on which product they will put into their needs profile.

199
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
You could put in the question of what is now called externalities,

200
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
like the extraction of ecological resources.

201
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
And the other one would be, for example,

202
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,800
happiness of the workers within the workers council.

203
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,800
You could put in a anonymous way of feedback on the happiness within the council.

204
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,800
And then, of course, I would prefer to purchase a use value from a workers council

205
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
where people like to work.

206
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:55,800
And this is a super important thing to communicate in such a system, I guess.

207
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
And it's totally lacking right now.

208
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Sure. I'm so glad you raised this point, because this is one of the features

209
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
of this kind of needs-based socialist system

210
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,800
that is supposed to elevate our consciousness, make us more socially aware.

211
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,800
And the general catalog will include a lot of detailed information

212
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
about each use value that we don't normally have access to.

213
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,800
And a lot of it includes things like the conditions under which the use value was produced, as you said.

214
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
And so consumers will be able to take that into account.

215
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,800
So social movements like movements for animal rights and environmental protection,

216
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
those kinds of movements will still play a very important role

217
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,800
because it will encourage people to rank certain use values higher in their needs profiles

218
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,800
based on what they're hearing and learning about the conditions under which these use values are produced.

219
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
So glad you raised that point.

220
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:07,800
One big question that came up is that you very much depend on the category of the proletariat as a force, actually.

221
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:15,800
As a political force and as the barrier of these revolutionary ideas.

222
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:25,800
And of course, this brings up the question of whether this proletariat actually still exists as a category,

223
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
especially in terms of class consciousness.

224
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Is this in the 21st century still a thing?

225
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Well, I think that this proletariat, as we call it,

226
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,800
it does consist of people that have very different living standards, very different occupations, and so on.

227
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,800
But the one aspect that all proletarians have in common, I think,

228
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
is that they cannot live unless they sell their labor power.

229
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,800
And that characteristic hasn't really changed.

230
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,800
So they don't have sufficient wealth to guarantee that they can live from ownership of wealth alone.

231
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
And so for a change in the mode of production,

232
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,800
these people would need to recognize this shared characteristic

233
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,800
and then take this kind of revolutionary action to change the mode of production.

234
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,800
It won't be easy, but I think it's a necessary condition.

235
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:27,800
It would require a huge amount of cooperation and coordination across a very diverse group of people.

236
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Very diverse. But it's the necessary condition, I think.

237
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,800
And also, on the other hand, I think, of course, it sounds kind of old school, the category of proletariat,

238
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,800
but the category as such didn't diminish.

239
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,800
And I think because things are getting worse and worse and billionaires are getting trillionaires

240
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:56,800
and the rest is getting worse, I think there's room for raising class consciousness again.

241
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,800
And there's an attractiveness to that as well, I guess.

242
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I have one more on the category of freedom and individual I see.

243
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:15,800
And this is aiming at the inner structure of the workers councils.

244
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:24,800
At some point within the book, you mentioned that there will be a monitoring of the fulfillment of your work responsibilities

245
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,800
and that these will be communicated by system administrators.

246
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I think even at the end of the day, you're right.

247
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
This seems a bit much, I guess.

248
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
But besides the question whether or not it will be every day,

249
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,800
there's first the question of elitism as well on the hand of the system administrators.

250
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,800
And then this kind of brings up questions of, you know,

251
00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:01,800
ugly situations between the peers in quotation marks that have to surveil each other

252
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,800
in terms of how good did you work or how bad did you work and stuff like that.

253
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
So this could get ugly, I think.

254
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Sure. No, I had something a little different in mind.

255
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
In terms of evaluation within the councils,

256
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:21,800
the efforts ratings subcommittees would consist of workers who are members of the council.

257
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
That would be a rotating body.

258
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:31,800
And, you know, each council could decide on its own how frequently it wants to rotate membership in that subcommittee.

259
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Those effort ratings would involve adjusting the annual income maybe once a year.

260
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,800
When I said that the or when I wrote that the workers council would communicate

261
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,800
to the system administrators at the end of the day,

262
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,800
what I had in mind there was just that work had been completed that day.

263
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Nothing more than that.

264
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,800
And the reason I actually said per day was because whereas currently

265
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,800
workers have to wait to receive a paycheck, maybe two weeks, possibly longer,

266
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
in this system, there's no reason to delay.

267
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Workers can be paid immediately at the end of their work day.

268
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,800
It's just a matter of making sure that since these system administrators

269
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
actually are the ones that grant the credits,

270
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,800
they would need to be notified that membership is still current,

271
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
the worker still works as part of the council.

272
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,800
That's all. It's not supposed to be a method of evaluation

273
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,800
or something that would be withheld for poor performance.

274
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Yes, I didn't have that in mind.

275
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,800
OK, maybe there could be a rotating element as well to the system administrators.

276
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,800
So there is no power accumulation in their hands, actually.

277
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I think that's a good idea as well.

278
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,800
There are some areas where I ask myself if your proposal might run into

279
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,800
reproducing errors of the current political, economical system.

280
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
The first one is about the role of competition,

281
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
which I struggle with, I have to say,

282
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:25,800
because I find competition to be one of the evils within our society

283
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,800
many times, I think, not only, but most of the times, I guess.

284
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,800
You state that a classless society can be expected to be quite competitive.

285
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
I think, actually, this is kind of problematic,

286
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,800
because I'm not sure if this doesn't reproduce a conception of humans

287
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,800
as a species that needs to be disciplined and supervised.

288
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
I do get the point that the proposal should not be utopian.

289
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I said it before, and that other non-competitive proposals

290
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,800
do have a omission here and often retreat to overly positive interpretations

291
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,800
of how things will naturally fall into place somehow.

292
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,800
But still, I'm not convinced of the large role of competition.

293
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Could you maybe explain why you decided to approach things that way?

294
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Yeah, I want to emphasize that competition would play a really minimal role

295
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,800
in the kind of socialist society that I'm describing.

296
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,800
There wouldn't be competition between workers' councils,

297
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,800
not directly any kind of competition in terms of income determination.

298
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
I mean, this would all be minimized, I think.

299
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Where there is competition, I think, and where I find it hard to eliminate competition,

300
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,800
is in terms of workers trying to obtain membership and councils

301
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
to perform specific kinds of work.

302
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,800
If one of the guiding principles is from each according to his or her ability,

303
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,800
then I think that it's important that workers and young people

304
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:16,800
who are entering school and trying to gain admission to an educational program,

305
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,800
let's say a young person wants to become a doctor,

306
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
they're going to need to compete with their peers

307
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,800
in order to secure those spots in those programs,

308
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
or to secure a spot in a workers' council to do the kind of work that they want to do,

309
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
because they have to prove that they're able to do it.

310
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
That's really all I'm imagining for competition,

311
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:46,800
and I find it hard to let go of that as a principle that would need to be in place

312
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,800
to ensure that people do demonstrate ability.

313
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Yeah, I understand that, I have to say, because it's kind of a check as well,

314
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,800
that if somebody who really, really, really wants to become a doctor,

315
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
but is just simply really, really not qualified to become one,

316
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,800
then one has to be somehow honest about it

317
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,800
and find a way to evaluate whether the person is qualified or not.

318
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,800
And I guess it's a fact somehow.

319
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,800
There's another element of competition, though, that I spot and wanted to ask you about,

320
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:38,800
and that is if a workers' council decides to produce a product,

321
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,800
and they post it in the general catalogue,

322
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,800
and other workers' councils are also posting a similar product,

323
00:30:51,800 --> 00:31:01,800
then people might decide to purchase it from the one that builds it from aluminium

324
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,800
and the other one that produces it with plastic that is not being purchased.

325
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,800
So the needs will be fulfilled, but not mostly from the company,

326
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,800
or the socialist enterprise that uses the plastic, in my example.

327
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:21,800
So there will be some kind of competition with regards to that,

328
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:29,800
and that might be spotted through when people purchase what, where,

329
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,800
and then you might have an indicator on what is more popular,

330
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,800
or you have a rating system as well, or a feedback system,

331
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,800
where people leave how they like the product or not.

332
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
So there will be some indicators, and it's good to have these indicators

333
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,800
because they are helpful in order to organise the production as well.

334
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,800
But this also introduces an element of competition, I guess, between the worker councils.

335
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,800
How is this conceptualised and used, maybe?

336
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah, that's a great question. You're right, you're right.

337
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,800
It could be interpreted as a form of competition between the worker's councils.

338
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,800
One council may find its point allocations dwindling,

339
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
and another's point allocations are increasing.

340
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,800
This could create tension between those councils. You're absolutely right.

341
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I think one important point maybe is that the compensation for useful work

342
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
isn't going to be effective.

343
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:38,800
So it's less likely to lead to resentment between those councils, at least for that reason.

344
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,800
And if one council is finding its point allocation diminishing

345
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:50,800
to the point where the council needs to dissolve and the other council is expanding,

346
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,800
there's no reason why the expanding worker's council couldn't say

347
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,800
or encourage the former members of the other council to join them,

348
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,800
join the council, since their enterprise is expanding.

349
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,800
They don't need to come up with financial resources to pay those workers,

350
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
because that isn't how it works.

351
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,800
All they need to do is invite them to join the council to become members,

352
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,800
and they'll be entitled to their credit income.

353
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,800
As long as there's work for them to do, they can merge and resolve it that way,

354
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
in a cooperative kind of way.

355
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,800
So I think you're right. I think there are elements of competition that don't disappear.

356
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,800
But I think the underlying principle is cooperation in what I described, I think.

357
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Yeah, I would agree, actually.

358
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,800
And I think the main reason for that is that the profit motive is eliminated.

359
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Because of that, you are incentivized to help the other much more

360
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,800
than if it would be a competition for profit.

361
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,800
And of course, and that may be utopian on my part,

362
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,800
if you have a society that is organized around the principles that you described,

363
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:20,800
the hope is that one would internalize these different kinds of values as well.

364
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,800
And since there is no striving for profit,

365
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
then you wouldn't be incentivized to stab your peer in the back.

366
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
But you could easily, and without a loss for yourself,

367
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,800
just coach the other cooperative how to produce it differently,

368
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,800
that it might fulfill a better standard, and stuff like that.

369
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,800
And I really liked that in the way you described the proposal

370
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:53,800
when you were writing about the internalized principles of the capitalist mode of production.

371
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Because it's not just about the formal rules that we can have in laws and stuff like that.

372
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:09,800
But capitalism also functions through the way that I internalize

373
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:17,800
how the system is working and how I will have to behave in order to produce a likely outcome.

374
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:25,800
And this is kind of sucked up with baby milk.

375
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,800
You're formed around these expectations as a person as well.

376
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,800
And it's likely to expect that within the socialist mode of production,

377
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,800
there would be different types of values that are as well internalized

378
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,800
that are more formed around the value of cooperation, as you said it.

379
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,800
And so it becomes the question of how likely is a certain type of behavior being made?

380
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
And I like that, actually.

381
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Yeah, I think that's a great point.

382
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
And one of the central, I think, insights of Marxian theory

383
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:10,800
is that people's consciousness is actually transformed depending upon the mode of production that governs society.

384
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
And so we can't even imagine, I don't think fully,

385
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,800
how much people's consciousness would be transformed if it moved to this kind of society.

386
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
The value system, as you say, everything would be different.

387
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
People would just think differently about everything.

388
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,800
And hopefully in ways that are much healthier, much better.

389
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,800
There's a second question relating to the question of reproducing errors that I have.

390
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,800
At some point in the book, I had the quick flash where I was thinking,

391
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:52,800
oh, hoppala, this might be a reproduction of this there is no such thing as society phrase of Margaret Thatcher.

392
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
And I'd like to quote you here in order to explain what I mean.

393
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,800
The quote is in his 1844 critique of different varieties of communism.

394
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:11,800
However, Marx wants that what is to be avoided above all is the reestablishing of society as an abstraction vis-à-vis the individual.

395
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
The individual is the social being.

396
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,800
And then there you end the quote of Marx.

397
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Therefore, it is only necessary to identify the manner in which the individual in a socialist society

398
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,800
must interact with others to fully develop his or her species consciousness.

399
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Because the market is deemed anti-ethical to this cause, it must be replaced with a new mechanism.

400
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,800
And then, of course, you go on to describe the mechanism.

401
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:52,800
But still, I was asking myself if you're talking about a kind of individualistic approach that more or less mirrors this.

402
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,800
There is no such thing as society phrase from Margaret Thatcher, but just in a socialist manner somehow.

403
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Maybe I'm not phrasing this correct, but I hope you get the point.

404
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,800
No, I do think I know what you mean.

405
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:17,800
What I'm imagining is that the public functions which I've described, like the system administration,

406
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:25,800
the work of the Council of Scientists and so on, would become sort of merged with all other processes in society

407
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,800
in a way that doesn't seem like the state exists as something separate and standing apart from society.

408
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,800
There still would be these public functions, as I've described them,

409
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,800
but I think the transformation in the way people relate to one another would allow those public functions

410
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,800
to become sort of subsumed or just part of society instead of standing apart

411
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,800
or us imagining those state functions as being separate or apart from society.

412
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
I hope that helps.

413
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Yeah, I think I know what you mean. It kind of points to the question of withering away of the state.

414
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Yes, that's right. And I don't think these public functions would wither away and disappear.

415
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Those are still going to be there.

416
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Yeah, but it wouldn't be a state that is apart from us somehow.

417
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Yes, that's right. That's exactly right.

418
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:30,800
I was wondering if we might run into problems of promoting quantification

419
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,800
if we handle certain aspects of your model the way that you described it.

420
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Because if, for example, care work and stuff like that, education and things like that

421
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,800
would be a part of the general catalogue and would be handled throughout the mechanisms that you described,

422
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,800
then they would be handled in a way as if they were quantifiable,

423
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:06,800
even though these areas are having an internal logic that is not adequately represented in terms of quantification.

424
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:15,800
And that's a problem that we do see right now where neoliberals try to reform the health care system

425
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,800
along the lines of quantification, and they, to be frank, fucked it up.

426
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:33,800
And we do not want to replicate this idea of an overarching principle of quantification within these systems.

427
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,800
So how would you handle that?

428
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Yeah, it's a great question, and maybe this society would encounter problems

429
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,800
in trying to extend this principle to these areas.

430
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm willing to allow for that possibility.

431
00:40:50,800 --> 00:41:00,800
However, with care work, for example, the one possibility would be that if a family decided to perform that work themselves,

432
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
maybe designate one person in the family to do that work,

433
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,800
then it would be possible for that person to receive compensation for that work,

434
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,800
and they would just do what they would do in the home.

435
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,800
There may be workers' councils that specialize in care work,

436
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,800
and in that case, to include that in a needs profile,

437
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,800
it would just be necessary for the workers' council to post in the general catalogue a unit of that service,

438
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
like maybe an hour of work.

439
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
That could then be moved into the needs profile.

440
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,800
The workers' council specializing in care work would receive the point allocation according to that

441
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:43,800
and then could obtain the inputs that it needs in order to perform that service for those people who registered and need for it.

442
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,800
So I think things like care work can be handled.

443
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Again, maybe it would encounter problems I'm not seeing, but at least I think we can imagine a way to do it.

444
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,800
With education, that's also a difficult one.

445
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,800
And like you said, I haven't filled in all the details in the book.

446
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Others are going to have things to say about this, hopefully,

447
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,800
and they may have ideas on how to make this work.

448
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,800
But I at least have some ideas regarding education.

449
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I think that it's easiest, I guess, probably to start with an example where you have a,

450
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,800
let's say, an educational program that trains workers to do a specific type of work.

451
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Well, if that's the case, they're going to be producing some kind of a use value in the future.

452
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,800
And so whatever the current registered needs are for that use value could be used to determine the point allocation

453
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,800
for that educational program or that educational institution.

454
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Those points then could be used to acquire inputs, whatever is needed in order to educate students in that program.

455
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
So maybe I am overreaching.

456
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Maybe I'm saying, hey, this can apply to everywhere.

457
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,800
But I think we can at least think about how it might work.

458
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Now, if for some reason we ended up rejecting as a society, if we ended up rejecting it

459
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,800
because it somehow doesn't work well, we should be open to that, I think.

460
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,800
But I think we also should make the effort, if we really do want these to be the guiding principles of our society,

461
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,800
from each according to one's ability to each according to one's work initially and then to need later,

462
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,800
then it makes sense to try to do it.

463
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:40,800
And also, I think there will be some kind of mechanism for infrastructural work for like roads or trains and stuff like that.

464
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:49,800
And you could easily say that, OK, education as well is a basic infrastructure that we all need.

465
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,800
And of course, it is also important to have some moonshot projects.

466
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,800
It won't work that you will always know what kind of education you need,

467
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:11,800
because it's good to have some education that does not have a specific use just because you might just not know what use it will have in the future.

468
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:24,800
So it's an investment that still makes sense because you might foster insight into areas where you do not yet know that they will be of use in the future.

469
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,800
So that's like an infrastructure, a knowledge infrastructure somehow as well, no?

470
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Yeah, you picked up on the fact that I chose the easier example when I chose an educational program that's aimed at producing a use value.

471
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Yes. And so that's more complicated.

472
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,800
And so like the more basic education is, you know, we'd have to think through how could we maybe make that work.

473
00:44:50,800 --> 00:45:03,800
And it may be that in those situations, we pull the points from from many different areas in order to allocate points to those educational institutions.

474
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:10,800
I mean, we may be able to do it that way since, you know, those institutions may be teaching just basic science.

475
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Maybe we can pull points from lots of workers councils where that's where knowledge of science is relevant.

476
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
There might be ways to do it.

477
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,800
That's just something that our elected representatives are going to have to work out and determine how to make that work.

478
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,800
But I'm not sure there's any other way that we can just say right now exactly how to do it.

479
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Yeah, there are ways, at least.

480
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Yes, I think in order to to get a sense of how this proposal could be beneficial for all of us, let's engage in a thought experiment.

481
00:45:49,800 --> 00:46:00,800
If there had been a socialist mode of production and socialist laws of motion in place in the way that you described and in your proposal in the U.S.

482
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,800
During the corona pandemic, how would that have been beneficial in your opinion?

483
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Well, I certainly don't want to suggest that all human problems will disappear with the transition to this new mode of production.

484
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
But I can think of a couple of benefits.

485
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,800
First, I think that people will rank basic needs very highly using their needs profiles, including the need for medical care.

486
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
So many of society's resources will be devoted to health care.

487
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,800
And so the strain on this sector should be reduced in a situation like this.

488
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Also, I think people are going to be accustomed to thinking about others and less about just kind of doing business as usual.

489
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,800
So, you know, people have made a great effort to engage in self distancing.

490
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,800
But I think that you would see even more self-sacrifice in this kind of a society.

491
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:59,800
In addition, we wouldn't have powerful interests spreading false information to ensure that the economy continues to grow rapidly.

492
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,800
People's health really would be sort of the top priority, I think, in a situation like this.

493
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
And that would be helpful.

494
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:15,800
And finally, the profit motives would not promote this shameful mistreatment and widespread abuse of animals, I think, that exists in capitalist societies.

495
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,800
So these kinds of pandemics, I think, would be less likely to probably occur.

496
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:33,800
The likelihood of diseases originating from oppression of animals, I think, would decline significantly if we transitioned to this other kind of way of living.

497
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:50,800
And I think also because of the historical examples of planned economies, people will immediately say, oh, we know that planned economy, that's a super slow apparatus and they won't be able to react that fast in the case of a pandemic.

498
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,800
And then you need ventilators, but the state apparatus is so super slow, so they won't be able to do anything.

499
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:11,800
I mean, you're proposing a very, very different kind of system that is actually much more decentralized and has very different base assumptions.

500
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:18,800
But how would that relate to this fear of not being able to react fast?

501
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,800
This isn't something I gave that much attention to when I was writing the book.

502
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:31,800
One point that does come to mind that I did address, which is somewhat similar, I think, has to do with natural disasters.

503
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:45,800
So if there was a natural disaster that caused a large part of the population, let's say, to lose Internet access, it might be possible to set up the system so that immediately those needs profiles of those people

504
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:54,800
transitioned to kind of a more general one that would focus on addressing their most immediate needs first.

505
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,800
And then society's resources, point allocations would be redirected towards meeting those needs immediately.

506
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,800
So there might be ways to build in kind of emergency responses into the system.

507
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
Again, I think the system is very flexible.

508
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:17,800
There are ways to sort of to work on those problems in ways that I don't even think I've fully thought about.

509
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:26,800
And also, I think, again, the question of the profit motive is very crucial here, because in the in the case of a pandemic or any disaster,

510
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:38,800
actually, if you do not have the profit motive that hinders the collective forces of all humans to work towards a solution, then you will be better off, I think.

511
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:47,800
I mean, we saw that people were hoarding masks and stuff like that and holding them back because they thought they would get some profit out of it later on.

512
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,800
And people needed these masks, of course.

513
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,800
And so so this is just destructive behavior, I think.

514
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:01,800
And there would be there wouldn't be an incentive to to behave in ways like that, I think.

515
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:13,800
OK, I think it's also important to at least tease the idea of how we could get to implementing the proposals that you are describing in your book.

516
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:23,800
So there there has to be some kind of idea towards a transition phase and subsequent implementation of what you're trying to do here.

517
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Maybe let's just take a small country like Austria, where I live right now, as an example.

518
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,800
What would you propose in terms of a transition?

519
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
What would this look like?

520
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,800
How to proceed?

521
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Well, the sort of revolutionary transformation that I'm talking about really won't work unless it's broad enough to include major industries.

522
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:55,800
So if it's small, then workers councils will be they'll be forced to rely on markets to obtain inputs and they're going to need to obtain currency.

523
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
And that means selling products as commodities.

524
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,800
So this transformation is going to have to be very broad, very expansive for it to take hold.

525
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:13,800
I do think that one nation could transform the mode of production, but it will have to rely on international trade to some extent.

526
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,800
So I provide some suggestions in Chapter eight of the book regarding how this might work.

527
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:26,800
So like in some cases, consumers might register a need for a foreign commodity that is not available domestically.

528
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,800
The workers council that posts that foreign commodity would receive points to produce something.

529
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:40,800
It would use the points that it receives to produce something that it can trade as a commodity for the foreign produced commodity.

530
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:51,800
So there might be ways to still obtain goods from capitalist nations while transforming your mode of production domestically.

531
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:59,800
But still, I think too much reliance on commodity exchange is going to undermine the momentum of this shift to a new mode of production.

532
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:08,800
So that those are at least some some thoughts about how one might do one might pursue such a transformation in a small country.

533
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:16,800
But obviously, the smaller the the experiment is, the more obstacles it's going to face.

534
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:30,800
And apart from small countries, what are the couple of steps that you would propose if one wants to get on the pathway to a transition in general?

535
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Yes. So it would be necessary first for individuals to start communicating their needs using needs profiles.

536
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,800
And workers would need to start actually posting use values in a general catalog.

537
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:53,800
So all of this can start before any kind of revolutionary transformation takes place.

538
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,800
The infrastructure is there. It would just be necessary to actually start setting it up.

539
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,800
This would also be a good time to be educating people about how this system is going to work.

540
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:09,800
People are going to have to understand if they're going to actually move forward in trying to implement this.

541
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:22,800
Only after all of that is really kind of in place, would it then be possible to use it to start guiding resource allocation, to have workers actually take control of the means of production and so on.

542
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,800
And I mean, you know, it would it would require also a political movement.

543
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:39,800
Workers and consumers would would need to support political party and candidates for office who would actually want to try to pursue these kinds of changes.

544
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:47,800
So I think those are the things I see happening before there's even any abolition of private property or private ownership of the means of production.

545
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:58,800
These things would we need to take place first, the educational effort and the effort to actually start setting up a general catalog and needs profiles and so on.

546
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:16,800
That's super interesting. So if I understand that correctly, this would mean that you would necessarily have a hybrid version before and that we could actually start now to build this hybrid.

547
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Like the like a shadow economy, actually, with a needs with a general catalog where only use values are posted that are being produced.

548
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:42,800
With certain standards like only use values from cooperatives, for example.

549
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:59,800
So and if it grows and grows and grows and grows, then you would be more and more able to rely for most of your daily purchases on the use values of the general catalog and that it would like

550
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:11,800
that you would be able to fade out your purchasing via money and substitute it through purchases that you do on the general catalog. Am I right?

551
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Yes, that's right. The one thing I might add is that what is posted in the general catalog during this phase might also include commodities produced by capitalist firms.

552
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:39,800
So not just like workers cooperatives, there would need to be protections in place for workers to actually do this because capitalist enterprises may not want their commodities listed there because they know where this is moving.

553
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:47,800
And there's going to be resistance. So that's why protection from the state for these efforts would also need to be in place.

554
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:57,800
And that's why the political movement is important, too. Can't just do this and not expect capitalist interests to kind of look the other way.

555
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,800
They're not going to like this. They're going to resist. And so, yeah, so that's the thing I would add.

556
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:24,800
So, I mean, we actually pressed you on quite some topics already, but still, I'd like just to generally ask you, because we talked about the shortcomings of market socialism and we will talk about Paragon, another proposal soon.

557
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,800
I'd just like to ask you as well. What do you think are the shortcomings of your proposal?

558
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Yeah, I'm glad you asked me this question. It forced me to critique my own proposal in more than I have, I think, previously.

559
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:49,800
But some use values, I think, are easily incorporated in needs profiles and others are not so easily incorporated.

560
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,800
For example, shoes, you know, are easily included, whereas something like housing is more difficult.

561
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:04,800
I mainly hope to promote discussion of this proposal because I think there are many intelligent thinkers who are going to be able to think through some of these difficult questions.

562
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,800
I view what I did is mostly initiating this conversation, not as providing any kind of final answers on all of these questions.

563
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:21,800
And you pointed out, and I think rightly so, that there are certain use values and certain kinds of services like care work, education.

564
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:31,800
These are going to be difficult to include. So that is a shortcoming, I think, but maybe one that we can overcome by trying to work out the details.

565
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:40,800
The other shortcoming, I think, is that it might lead to complications that I just have not anticipated and that perhaps no one can anticipate.

566
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:52,800
I mean, what we're talking about is such a radical and drastic change in the way we live that there's no way to know completely how it would play out.

567
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:01,800
So, you know, these complications that come up, they could make the system unworkable for some reason. I'm willing to acknowledge that possibility.

568
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:15,800
However, I also think that we're approaching the time where we must have an open discussion about alternative economic systems if we're going to address these global environmental challenges that are really threatening all of us at this point.

569
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Now, of course, you are not the first one to propose an alternative political economy since the socialist calculation debate took place.

570
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:35,800
There have been others before and you discuss an approach called participatory economy or short paracon at length in your book.

571
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:44,800
How does paracon differ from your proposal? And since it is already being practiced, where and how is it being implemented today?

572
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:54,800
Paracon was developed by Michael Albert and Robin Hanell in the early 1990s and has been developed quite a bit since that time.

573
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:03,800
Paracon is a non-market participatory economic planning model that aims to promote remuneration based on effort and sacrifice and production.

574
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,800
So that's one of the similarities, I think, to my perspective.

575
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:16,800
It also involves council democracy, and so it includes workers councils and consumers councils that contribute to the formation of the annual economic plans.

576
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:22,800
Their planning process involves something called an iteration facilitation board.

577
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:27,800
It announces so-called indicative prices with the councils submitting plans.

578
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:34,800
And then the prices are set to account for social costs, not just private costs, the way market prices do.

579
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,800
The prices are also iteratively adjusted to clear markets, surpluses and shortages.

580
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Workers in a paracon society also work a variety of jobs as part of a so-called balanced job complex.

581
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:55,800
So that is that workers are assigned a mix of jobs, with some of the jobs being more empowering than others.

582
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,800
This is a significant difference from my proposal.

583
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:06,800
I don't have an element of this really where job complexes are formed and involve a balancing of empowering and disempowering tasks.

584
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:14,800
But the idea is that this approach is supposed to ensure that a class of workers never arises that only performs disempowering work

585
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:23,800
and avoids the rise of a class of workers that specializes only in coordination and what Albert and Hanel call a coordinator class,

586
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,800
which they think could easily arise and has arisen in socialist societies of the past.

587
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,800
They also think a set of values should underlie the paracon economy.

588
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,800
So these values include things like solidarity, equity, self-management, diversity.

589
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:49,800
There have been paraconish experiments that have been initiated in different countries, including Finland, Sweden, the UK, and the United States as well.

590
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Robin Hanel has a forthcoming book actually on democratic economic planning.

591
01:00:54,800 --> 01:01:00,800
So in terms of what I think the shortcomings are, these ideas had a major impact on me.

592
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:07,800
So I really want to emphasize that much of the socialist proposal that I developed in the book built on their vision of a participatory economy.

593
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,800
And so I have great respect for them as visionaries.

594
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:17,800
I have several objections to the paracon vision, however, that I think distinguish my proposal from their proposal.

595
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:29,800
So first, I think that the participatory planning process involves a trial and error method of adjusting prices that resembles the early suggestions in the socialist calculation debate.

596
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,800
And I really wanted to kind of move away from that.

597
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,800
I think we need a more dynamic and organic method of organizing the economy.

598
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:46,800
I also think that the balanced job complexes do not do enough to protect freedom, to pursue the occupations that one enjoys the most.

599
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,800
So I also deviate from that there.

600
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:59,800
I think from the phrase from each according to one's ability is more likely to be achieved if we allow workers to compete for jobs on the basis of ability.

601
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:06,800
As I was mentioning earlier, I also think the emphasis on a moral basis of the system is problematic.

602
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:13,800
And that, too, is something that makes my perspective, I think, different from a lot of thinkers on the left.

603
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,800
This sort of skepticism about objective morality.

604
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,800
I don't think we should try to pursue values or ideals that are detached from sort of objective conditions.

605
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,800
That's sort of how I think about it.

606
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Instead, we should be focused on ending capitalist exploitation, which I think is something we can discover through an analysis of existing conditions.

607
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:39,800
And so we should be focused on that rather than sort of striving for these these value ideals.

608
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,800
But even so, even with all that said, I think Parakhan offers features that I find to be attractive.

609
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,800
And again, they really influenced me in the development of my proposal.

610
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Great. And what I was actually a bit surprised to see is that you didn't really cover the proposal by Cockshart and Cottrell at length.

611
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:07,800
Maybe I was surprised because I did an interview actually with a PhD student of Cockshart before in Germany.

612
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,800
So I was a bit familiar with the ideas there.

613
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:23,800
And because it's one of the more prominent proposals out there for some kind of, let's say, digital socialism, I was expecting to read more about it.

614
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,800
But you didn't cover it that much.

615
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:34,800
I do see differences, of course, mainly in the decentralized access.

616
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:41,800
So how do you relate to the proposal of Cockshart and Cottrell and how is yours unique in relation to this?

617
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Well, yeah, I would say that the really embarrassing truth here is that limitations on my time were the reason that I did not investigate it in detail.

618
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:01,800
I had to make some choices and Parakhan was the one that I decided to really devote attention to.

619
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,800
I think that what makes mine unique is that it grew out of my work on Marxian theory.

620
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,800
And this point is really quite subtle.

621
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:19,800
You can see it if you compare my work on Marx's theory of the turnover process of capital with my breakdown of the socialist circulation process into five phases.

622
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,800
I use a timeline to do that in the book.

623
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,800
And it really did.

624
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:33,800
It emerged from my close analysis of reading capital volumes one and two in particular.

625
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:40,800
And, you know, so for this reason, I think that I like to think and maybe I'm wrong,

626
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:48,800
but I think that I've developed the only vision of the socialist mode of production that is really consistent with Marx's theory of the capitalist mode of production,

627
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,800
which is quite a strong claim to make.

628
01:04:52,800 --> 01:05:00,800
But since it emerged from my study of Marx's capital, I think I can make that claim.

629
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,800
I don't think the other alternatives achieve that.

630
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:14,800
Finding a substitute for that movement of capital that I described earlier and that's found in volume one of Marx's capital.

631
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:25,800
So, yeah, I'm afraid I don't have much more to say in terms of my relationship to Cockshott and Cottrell's proposal.

632
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:31,800
But I think comparisons would definitely be worth investigating in more detail.

633
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:45,800
Yeah, to me, it seems as if you were more striving for a kind of organic socialist law of motion and that Cockshott and Cottrell seem to be looking for,

634
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:51,800
and I'm being polemic here, seem to be looking for a perfect plan that can be computed.

635
01:05:51,800 --> 01:06:00,800
You know, and that's very different from from the way you approach things in a very basic level, on a very, very basic level, I think.

636
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:06,800
So the book came out in 2015 and now it's five years later.

637
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:17,800
So I think there might be some development on different ends, not the least technological.

638
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:25,800
So Amazon got a hold of more and more and more and more of our lives and economies.

639
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:35,800
And by doing that also kind of engages in a proof of concept when it comes to the question of general catalogs.

640
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:45,800
So they are, for example, doing things like giving you a better price if you subscribe to certain products.

641
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:57,800
So that kind of reminded me of the idea that you should plan ahead and put in your needs in the general catalog and stuff like that.

642
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:08,800
So some of these things are already being done, but in a, of course, capitalist fashion and within a capitalist mode of production.

643
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:16,800
What has changed in these last five years? What did disprove or prove your proposals to be right?

644
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:25,800
Yeah, you've asked an interesting question here in his review of my book, actually, which appeared in the review of Radical Political Economics.

645
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:31,800
John Willoughby has dubbed my proposal Amazon Socialism. I don't know if you encountered that.

646
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,800
Yes, I read it. I read it. Yeah.

647
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,800
I found that to be amusing that he called it that. And I think you're right.

648
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,800
I think there are elements there that are similar to what I described.

649
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:55,800
So it has a massive offering of commodities that I think suggest or shows that we have the technical infrastructure to to make it a reality.

650
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:06,800
We can have a general catalog that has a massive amount of use values and the specifications are clearly listed in great detail.

651
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,800
But it's still commodity production, ultimately, and that and it represents capital in motion.

652
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,800
And in that sense, what Amazon does is nothing like what I've proposed.

653
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:23,800
So there's definitely an element there that's similar, but also it diverges significantly.

654
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:35,800
And and there are some things, too, that are that would be, I think, emphasized in the general catalog that aren't emphasized, you know, in Amazon's listings, for example.

655
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:42,800
You know, for example, like the date range for the purchase in order to qualify for a bonus, things like that.

656
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:53,800
Those are, I guess, elements that that don't really apply in the realm of commodity production that do apply in the socialist proposal.

657
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:59,800
So all the question of environmental destruction is not listed on Amazon as well.

658
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,800
It's just called externality.

659
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:11,800
But did you read the piece by Evgeny Morozov in the New Left Review called Digital Socialism?

660
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,800
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Because he he talks about your proposal at length as well.

661
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:23,800
Yes. I was really grateful for that review for that, at least that analysis of what I what I wrote.

662
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,800
And I think it helped gain attention for the proposal. Yeah.

663
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:38,800
And he's pointing out the need to socialize the means of feedback production, I think, is the phrase, because when you talked about Amazon and how it is different and how it still might be helpful,

664
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:46,800
I think that's a that's a point to emphasize. It's there is a technological infrastructure of means of feedback production.

665
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:55,800
That is actually the basis for why you say that this proposal is possible now and it hasn't been before.

666
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:05,800
No, I think that's the circle. How we get to the to the beginning of the interview that you state that Marx wouldn't have been able to see this solution.

667
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:13,800
And by that, it was kind of clever not to engage in what would have been a utopian speculation at the time.

668
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:22,800
If you would have wanted to sketch the these ideas of how socialist mode of production could look like.

669
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,800
And so he refrained from it. That's kind of one of one part of the argument.

670
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:35,800
Yeah. Yeah. And I think if we if we don't accept what I've said here, then what is it that Marx did?

671
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:45,800
And was it just I don't know, like some people believe it was just a big lie.

672
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:59,800
But why? Why? Why is it the lie then? Because I mean, if you if you provide a super good analysis of the capitalist mode of production, it's still some it's good work, you know?

673
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Yes. It's something. Yes. And so so that made you know, it could leave us though with a very depressing sort of conclusion that what Marx did was this extraordinary analysis of capitalism.

674
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:23,800
And we're all condemned forever now to live in a society based on class exploitation. There's nothing we can do about it.

675
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:29,800
You know, that is so that is so depressing. So I think a lot of people don't want to think that way about it.

676
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:37,800
So instead, they say, well, he was wrong. He just got it wrong. You know, it's kind of the system's contradictory or whatever.

677
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,800
You know, the transformation problem proves he was wrong or whatever.

678
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:54,800
I mean, the deterministic idea of how the like how the phases will one lead to another and then there will be this revolution and that was wrong.

679
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,800
But that doesn't mean that the analysis of the capitalist mode of production was wrong.

680
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:21,800
I mean, it's not that easy. But I think this is one of the main benefits that I got from reading your book is that I do not believe that we have to suffer this exploitation for the rest of our lives and into eternity.

681
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:27,800
But there are different modes of production that can be achieved.

682
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:35,800
And this is actually that this this leaves me optimistic and not depressed, I have to say.

683
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:41,800
Well, that's great. I'm so glad that I wanted to I wanted to complete the story somehow.

684
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:52,800
This is this is what could emerge from capitalism and and it's a future that that can give us hope.

685
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:59,800
Yes, but it's not it's not it's not a completion, though. It's a it's an opening, I'd say.

686
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:08,800
Yes. OK, then at the end of each of my interviews, I always ask the question.

687
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,800
If you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

688
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:26,800
Well, I think this idea that that one day everybody might cooperate within this global system of production and distribution is such an exciting possibility.

689
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:38,800
In the society that I've tried to describe today, you know, everyone's needs are given equal weight in the economic process and no one takes advantage of others for material gain.

690
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:49,800
It's hard to imagine, you know, with all the problems facing our our world today that we could live in a society like that.

691
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,800
But I think actually it's become easier to imagine than ever before.

692
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,800
We just we need to have this conversation.

693
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:11,800
And, you know, I'm so grateful that you initiated this and that you're willing to share these ideas with the people of Austria and with people everywhere.

694
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,800
So I'm deeply grateful to you for doing that. Thank you.

695
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:21,800
Well, Dan, thank you so much for taking the time to be a part of future histories.
