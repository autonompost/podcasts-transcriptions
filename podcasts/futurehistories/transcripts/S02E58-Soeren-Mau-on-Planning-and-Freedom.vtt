Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome

00:05.760 --> 00:08.160
Sören Mao in today's episode.

00:08.160 --> 00:14.720
Sören is a communist philosopher and author of the brilliant book Mute Compulsion, a Marxist

00:14.720 --> 00:20.440
Theory of the Economic Power of Capital, which I enjoyed reading a lot.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.960
And by the way, it's also available in German under the title Stummerzwang, eine Marxistische

00:25.960 --> 00:32.280
Analyse der ökonomischen Macht im Kapitalismus, published by the great Karl Dietz Verlag.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.440
So go and get it.

00:34.440 --> 00:40.860
More recently, an essay by Sören titled Communism as Freedom has been translated from Danish

00:40.860 --> 00:46.280
in multiple languages actually, so it's available in English as well.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.040
Both of these works, the book as well as the essay, are relevant for the conversation you're

00:51.040 --> 00:52.600
about to hear.

00:52.600 --> 00:58.480
Before we start, I'd like to thank Lukas, Fabian and Wilfried for their kind donations

00:58.480 --> 01:04.200
and welcome Markus, Daniel and Jakob as patrons of Future Histories.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.800
Thank you so much.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.520
And then some quick social media news.

01:08.520 --> 01:15.720
You can now follow Future Histories on Blue Sky as well, so go and follow, I guess.

01:15.720 --> 01:20.840
And since I never mentioned it before on the podcast on air, there's also a Future Histories

01:20.840 --> 01:22.880
newsletter you can subscribe to.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.240
So you might do that as well.

01:25.240 --> 01:36.680
But now please enjoy today's episode with Sören Mao on planning and freedom.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.300
Welcome Sören.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.300
Thank you.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.680
And thank you so much for inviting me.

01:40.680 --> 01:46.600
Sören, I'm absolutely convinced that freedom and security are two crucial pillars that

01:46.600 --> 01:51.820
must be positively occupied when constructing alternative political imaginaries.

01:51.820 --> 01:56.960
So I was extremely happy to see you make such a strong and very clear-minded case for

01:56.960 --> 02:00.280
why communism is freedom.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.160
Could you explain to us why communism is freedom and why security is part of the package as

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
well?

02:06.160 --> 02:12.440
Well, I think that for me, freedom is kind of like the guiding principle for thinking

02:12.520 --> 02:16.720
about how to organize a communist society.

02:16.720 --> 02:21.440
And maybe the reason for that is that, or it has to do with what I think the problem

02:21.440 --> 02:23.480
with capitalism is.

02:23.480 --> 02:29.920
I wouldn't emphasize, first of all, that it's an unjust system of exploitation or that it's

02:29.920 --> 02:33.160
alienating, for example.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.560
But I would argue that the most important reason why, or the thing that's first of

02:38.800 --> 02:44.000
all wrong with capitalism is that it implies domination, that it's an enemy of freedom,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.960
that capitalism is an economic system that prohibits people from living the life they

02:50.960 --> 02:52.160
want to live.

02:52.160 --> 02:56.120
And that's what I write about in my book, Mute Compulsion, that capitalism is a system

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
of domination.

02:57.120 --> 03:04.120
So it kind of follows from that critique of capitalism that we should think of an alternative

03:04.120 --> 03:10.200
to capitalism as a way of avoiding domination, as creating a society with the highest possible

03:10.200 --> 03:11.280
degree of freedom.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.160
So that's how I think about what communism should be.

03:16.160 --> 03:22.200
So that's my guiding principle to think of a society with the highest degree of freedom.

03:22.200 --> 03:29.720
So in that sense, I think freedom is the first and most important principle maybe of communism.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.680
And how does this relate to the question of security?

03:32.680 --> 03:43.240
Well, I think security is a condition for exercising freedom that we want to be able

03:43.240 --> 03:46.400
to exercise in a communist society.

03:46.400 --> 03:54.840
So in that sense, it's also a presupposition or it's a fundamental thing about communism

03:54.840 --> 03:56.120
also.

03:56.120 --> 04:04.240
In the sense that only on the basis of existential security and an absence of fear of not being

04:04.240 --> 04:08.240
able to sustain oneself, freedom can develop.

04:08.240 --> 04:14.800
That's kind of the reason I know.

04:14.800 --> 04:21.360
One of the primary aims of a communist society would be to secure unconditional access to

04:21.360 --> 04:28.720
everything that people need to live a good and stable and healthy life.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.560
And just as an additional follow up in terms of the definition of freedom.

04:33.560 --> 04:40.720
So the way that you described it before, it was very much related to an absence of domination.

04:40.720 --> 04:48.720
Are there other aspects of freedom that you would stress when it comes to this huge and

04:48.720 --> 04:52.040
fundamental question of what this actually means?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.040
Freedom?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.040
Yes.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.120
Well, I like the definition of freedom as absence of domination, but I would also and

04:58.120 --> 05:04.040
I think this is maybe just another way of saying that actually that freedom is intrinsically

05:04.040 --> 05:11.880
connected to democracy or is a democratic idea in the sense that human beings are by

05:11.880 --> 05:19.240
nature social beings and human beings are also natural beings, a part of nature and

05:19.240 --> 05:27.120
are dependent on the earth and the earth belongs to no one and therefore to everyone.

05:27.120 --> 05:34.120
And that means in a sense that we are by nature political animals and that the question of

05:34.120 --> 05:40.960
how human beings relate to their conditions of existence is necessarily a political question.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.160
And because of that, I think that freedom is not just a question of the relationship

05:44.160 --> 05:48.480
between the individual and the political community or political institutions.

05:48.480 --> 05:54.520
And that would be like the modern or liberal notion of political freedom, that freedom

05:54.520 --> 05:59.440
is a question of the absence of political institutions from the point of view of the

05:59.440 --> 06:00.560
individual.

06:00.560 --> 06:06.400
Freedom also has to consist in being able to participate in making decisions about

06:06.400 --> 06:11.360
the necessarily common aspects of our lives.

06:11.360 --> 06:16.640
And in that sense, I think freedom is inherently a democratic ideal.

06:16.640 --> 06:23.560
And since you mentioned this logic that you apply when it comes to the question of human

06:23.560 --> 06:30.280
nature or humans relation to nature, I think it would also be maybe a useful aspect to

06:30.280 --> 06:36.680
point out that when it comes to this idea of freedom, as far as I understand your idea

06:36.680 --> 06:43.760
of it, it does not entail a certain naturalized idea of that there was a human subject as

06:43.760 --> 06:50.280
an essence that should be kind of brought into full fruition, so to speak.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.920
At least that's how I understood it, that you are opposed to this notion of a naturalized

06:54.920 --> 07:00.160
kind of free individual that is suppressed by the conditions that surround them.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.800
Yes, that's right.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.560
So one way of putting it would be to say that there is no natural in the sense of an immediately

07:07.560 --> 07:12.320
given way for human beings to relate to their conditions of existence.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.760
It's always a political question.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.420
So it's up to us.

07:16.420 --> 07:24.200
So communism is not an exercise in trying to discover the authentic natural ways for

07:24.200 --> 07:28.080
human beings to relate to their conditions of existence.

07:28.080 --> 07:36.440
But communism means establishing the political conditions for actually making decisions

07:36.440 --> 07:44.240
about how we want to relate to our collective conditions of existence.

07:44.240 --> 07:48.160
And there's no natural way of doing that.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.000
It's always a political decision.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.760
And there's no subject that should be liberated beneath that, right?

07:55.760 --> 07:56.760
Exactly.

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
Okay.

07:57.760 --> 08:04.480
So we will get to the point where we kind of dive a little bit deeper into the way you

08:04.480 --> 08:11.440
imagine the set up for how communism might bring all of these things about.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.660
But before we do so, I would first like to address a different layer of abstraction,

08:16.660 --> 08:21.120
so to speak, which I believe to be of great importance for the way in which we think

08:21.120 --> 08:22.800
about alternatives.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.060
In your book, Mute Compulsion, you argue that Marx's critique is not aiming to provide

08:28.060 --> 08:32.940
an alternative political economy, but that he instead criticizes the field of political

08:32.940 --> 08:40.020
economy as such and the implicit assumptions and concepts that are baked into it, so to

08:40.020 --> 08:41.020
speak.

08:41.020 --> 08:47.580
So what are the elements and functional logics of the field of political economy that Marx

08:47.580 --> 08:52.100
criticized and what does this critique mean for the way in which we think about alternatives

08:52.100 --> 08:54.380
to capitalism today?

08:54.380 --> 09:01.900
I think that probably the most fundamental gesture in Marx's critique of political economy

09:01.900 --> 09:03.820
is to historicize.

09:03.820 --> 09:10.500
So the problem with the field of political economy is, first of all, it's a historical

09:10.500 --> 09:14.980
way of thinking about capitalism or about the economy.

09:14.980 --> 09:19.460
So I think that's the most important shift of perspective in Marx's critique of political

09:19.460 --> 09:25.180
economy and his critique of capitalism, to view the capitalist economy as a historical

09:25.180 --> 09:29.660
reality, as something that came into being at a certain point in history for certain

09:29.660 --> 09:33.520
historical reasons that we need to uncover and explain.

09:33.520 --> 09:40.960
So another way of saying that is to say that the problem with political economy is its

09:40.960 --> 09:53.360
economism, its tendency to, and that's something that you also find in mainstream economics

09:53.360 --> 10:01.520
today and also, I would say, much political science, the often implicit idea that the

10:01.520 --> 10:09.240
economy is a separated sphere of society governed by its own distinct forms of rationality.

10:09.240 --> 10:14.360
I think Robert Brenner puts it very well, he writes somewhere that historical materialist

10:14.360 --> 10:22.380
accounts of capitalism begin by denying the existence of a transhistorical economic rationality.

10:22.380 --> 10:32.940
So the idea is to politicize the economy, to see the economy as consisting of social

10:32.940 --> 10:41.340
relations, historically specific social relations, and therefore as a political reality, and

10:41.340 --> 10:49.560
that means rejecting the conceptual separation between politics and economics, the political

10:49.560 --> 10:51.640
and the economic.

10:51.640 --> 10:57.260
So that's obviously also important for how we think about alternatives to capitalism,

10:57.260 --> 11:06.820
because that means that there are no transhistorical economic laws, there is no such thing as

11:06.820 --> 11:11.080
transhistorical economic rationality.

11:11.080 --> 11:18.520
It's up to us to decide how the economy should be organized, that means it's up to us to

11:18.520 --> 11:23.940
decide what should be produced and who should produce it and how it should be produced

11:23.940 --> 11:26.300
and who should get the results of that production and so on.

11:26.300 --> 11:31.980
All of these economic processes, all of these economic decisions are always necessarily

11:31.980 --> 11:35.500
political decisions.

11:35.500 --> 11:43.300
So I think that's maybe the most fundamental idea in Marx's critique of political economy.

11:43.300 --> 11:47.880
Okay, let's maybe dig a little deeper into that.

11:47.880 --> 11:53.920
So in your article you write that it's not, when it comes to the question of alternatives,

11:53.920 --> 11:59.680
you write that following from that it's not about providing an alternative economic principle,

11:59.680 --> 12:04.700
but that it's instead, and I quote, you hear about enabling democratic decision making

12:04.700 --> 12:08.900
about how our shared activities and resources should be organized.

12:08.900 --> 12:14.700
And I think you already mentioned some aspects that are kind of related to this question

12:14.700 --> 12:21.620
when it comes to how to avoid, let's say, the mistakes of economists, so to speak.

12:21.620 --> 12:24.660
But I would be interested to take a second look into this.

12:24.660 --> 12:30.720
Would you say that we should kind of ditch economics altogether?

12:30.720 --> 12:38.180
You stated that you need to historicize it, there are no transhistorical laws of economics,

12:38.180 --> 12:39.260
so to speak.

12:39.260 --> 12:44.460
But are there, let's say, some aspects maybe of the theoretical apparatus of political

12:44.460 --> 12:53.580
economy or maybe a bit more narrowly economics that can sensibly be repurposed for a constructive

12:53.580 --> 13:00.960
effort around alternatives, or would you argue that we should kind of ditch the discipline

13:00.960 --> 13:02.800
of economics altogether?

13:02.800 --> 13:06.560
That would be one part of my question and the other one would be, and this is a very

13:06.560 --> 13:13.960
crucial aspect to me, in neoliberalism, the market constitutes also a site for the production

13:13.960 --> 13:15.340
of truth.

13:15.340 --> 13:23.440
So if we argue for overcoming the market in this function as well, I'm asking myself,

13:23.440 --> 13:32.360
what could be the mechanisms, maybe in plural, to fulfill this aspect of societal organization?

13:32.360 --> 13:38.360
Because this is a very, very crucial mechanism, I would say, within the way our societies

13:38.360 --> 13:46.840
are governed today, and I get the sense that simply stating we will do it democratically

13:46.840 --> 13:51.640
then does not kind of answer the questions sufficiently, I would say, because these

13:51.640 --> 13:59.200
things operate on different levels, I would say.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.680
To be honest, I'm not sure I understand why saying we will do that democratically

14:04.680 --> 14:12.280
is not a good answer, because I think that the way the function of the market in capitalism

14:12.280 --> 14:21.760
as one of the functions of the market in a capitalist society is coordinating production,

14:21.760 --> 14:27.080
coordinating decisions of individual producing units about how much to produce and how to

14:27.080 --> 14:32.120
produce things, by what productivity standards and so on.

14:32.120 --> 14:39.240
That's one of the things that price signals does, and that would be replaced by planning.

14:39.240 --> 14:47.000
So we would take, in a communist society, we would make democratic decisions about

14:47.000 --> 14:52.840
what are we going to produce, and we would also be able, for example, to take democratic

14:52.840 --> 14:58.480
decisions about production methods and productivity standards, for example.

14:58.480 --> 15:06.760
So in that sense, I think my answer would simply be that we are going to replace the

15:06.760 --> 15:13.200
market and market mechanisms with democratic decision processes.

15:13.200 --> 15:20.400
And I'm not sure why that's not a good answer.

15:20.400 --> 15:27.800
It's an absolutely great answer in general, I would say, but since I conducted quite

15:27.800 --> 15:33.320
a couple of interviews on democratic planning by now with different people who develop different

15:33.320 --> 15:38.080
models surrounding that, I more and more got the sense that at some point, when it comes

15:38.080 --> 15:44.080
to crucial questions within these models, this is the default answer, which is kind

15:44.080 --> 15:47.280
of serving as a cover-up in many ways.

15:47.280 --> 15:53.560
And it's serving as a cover-up, for example, when it comes to questions of valuation

15:53.560 --> 16:01.720
or evaluation, like measure, what's the way in which we kind of agree to measure, let's

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
say?

16:02.720 --> 16:09.680
What do we agree on what the basis of our decision-making and evaluation is, so to speak?

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
So that's one element.

16:10.680 --> 16:17.800
And the other one is that in some of the instances, there's a certain, for me, problematic

16:17.800 --> 16:23.360
fallback to a certain notion of the subject, because then if you go further, you know,

16:23.360 --> 16:26.400
we do it democratically, okay, fine, that's great.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.880
And then what's the basis of this democratic process?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.320
And then you get to the question of the subject.

16:32.320 --> 16:38.560
And then in many instances, you have a kind of weird notion of the underlying subject,

16:38.560 --> 16:44.280
I would say, which is conceptualized as an autonomous, self-activating and self-governing

16:44.280 --> 16:51.280
subject, to quote Pat Devine, who otherwise has a very, very, very great model or idea

16:51.280 --> 16:53.560
of how to approach democratic planning.

16:53.560 --> 17:01.720
But there you get to some kind of, it gets more complicated than just stating, okay,

17:01.720 --> 17:06.760
we do it democratic and then it's fine, I would say, because there are certain questions

17:06.760 --> 17:11.600
that are attached to it that still need to be answered or that might complicate the

17:11.600 --> 17:14.960
whole thing quite a bit, I would say.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.720
But in general, it's of course right to say so.

17:17.720 --> 17:23.680
If we just state it very generally, then yes, absolutely, let's do democratic planning,

17:23.680 --> 17:26.680
of course.

17:26.680 --> 17:34.480
You're right that there are a lot of complicating factors here and it's obviously an extremely

17:34.560 --> 17:41.720
important question you raise about how we evaluate and how we measure and are we going

17:41.720 --> 17:46.760
to measure in hours and labor time, for example?

17:46.760 --> 17:52.200
Some people would say no, I don't really see a problem with doing that.

17:52.200 --> 18:01.240
But it's obviously extremely difficult, I think, to come up with a very clear answer

18:01.240 --> 18:05.360
to how we decide on productivity standards, for example.

18:05.360 --> 18:11.520
So if we democratically decide that we want to produce a certain amount of a certain

18:11.520 --> 18:19.440
product and then we need to know how much time does it take to produce that.

18:19.440 --> 18:24.560
And in order to make that calculation, we need a productivity standard.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.480
And how do we decide on that?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.680
Should it be the producers, for example, the people who are actually producing the product

18:30.680 --> 18:34.360
that should decide that, decide how they want to work?

18:34.360 --> 18:44.720
Or do we want to accept some kind of that they have to do it within certain limits,

18:44.720 --> 18:53.960
that the broader society as such can demand a certain productivity standard from the producers?

18:53.960 --> 19:01.760
But no matter how we answer those questions, I think it always comes back to that the

19:01.760 --> 19:08.680
only legitimate way of doing that in a communist society would be to do some sort of

19:08.680 --> 19:10.920
democratic decision making process.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.440
So that's a difficult question, but it's a question we would have to find some sort

19:15.440 --> 19:26.640
of answer to, because the alternative would be to accept the blind forces of the blind

19:26.640 --> 19:34.320
domination of the market or something like that, or a despotic authority of some sort.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.320
Right, right.

19:35.320 --> 19:39.160
No, no, neither of those, for sure.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.480
But maybe just to get an idea about the first part of the question.

19:43.480 --> 19:50.920
How much of the corpus of political economy and economics specifically can be repurposed

19:50.920 --> 19:53.840
in a sensible way for this constructive effort?

19:53.840 --> 19:58.520
Because I mean, somehow one gets the sense that it's built on rotten ground.

19:58.520 --> 20:05.080
But I mean, it is also there might still be something that can be useful.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.240
So I would be interested in your opinion on that.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.760
I'm not totally sure what to answer to this question.

20:09.760 --> 20:20.440
I'm tempted to say that there's not much of worth keeping in economics, but I think

20:20.440 --> 20:33.440
that a planned economy would require a lot of data gathering, data collecting, collecting

20:33.440 --> 20:38.400
and managing data and also a lot of calculation.

20:38.400 --> 20:46.520
And it might be that there are some aspects of economics that would be useful in order

20:46.520 --> 20:52.240
to do that calculation and handling of data, but I'm not sure.

20:52.240 --> 21:00.640
Okay, so let's kind of leave this very abstract level and get to a bit more concrete levels

21:00.640 --> 21:02.440
of the discussion.

21:02.440 --> 21:08.360
Your article describes some of the basic coordinates of how to organize our societies differently

21:08.360 --> 21:12.960
in communism in order to provide freedom, security and much, much more.

21:12.960 --> 21:20.480
Could you maybe run us through the basic coordinates of how you imagine communism to be organized?

21:20.480 --> 21:34.400
Yes, that's a big question, but I guess the basic idea is that communism requires replacing

21:34.400 --> 21:44.280
the market with planning and to create new political institutions that would enable

21:44.280 --> 21:50.560
us to make democratic decisions about what to do with our common resources and to make

21:50.560 --> 21:57.040
decisions about, economic decisions about what to produce and how to produce it and

21:57.040 --> 22:02.720
where and when and how to distribute the results of that production.

22:02.720 --> 22:10.560
And that's, I think, the basic coordinates, if that's what you mean.

22:10.560 --> 22:17.240
Well, maybe, I mean, there would be the need for some types of institutions, for example.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.000
So could you maybe go into that?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.920
Like what kind of institutions would we need?

22:21.920 --> 22:25.360
How would they need to be different from the institutions we have?

22:25.360 --> 22:29.320
So maybe you could give us a sketch of this institutional setup.

22:29.480 --> 22:36.360
Yes, I think that in order to secure the highest possible degree of freedom and security

22:36.360 --> 22:41.960
and in order to avoid concentration of power as much as possible, it would be useful to

22:41.960 --> 22:52.240
try to make decisions as close as possible to those who are affected by those decisions.

22:52.240 --> 23:01.240
I think that would be an important guiding principle for creating a network of institutions

23:01.240 --> 23:05.600
that would allow us to plan production.

23:05.600 --> 23:15.120
So power should be decentralised as much as possible.

23:15.120 --> 23:22.600
But of course, there are certain decisions that cannot be left to individuals or to

23:22.600 --> 23:29.360
small local groups or something like that, especially here, I'm especially thinking

23:29.360 --> 23:36.000
of decisions regarding use of natural resources.

23:36.000 --> 23:45.040
So we're obviously also going to need some sort of actually a global institution for

23:45.040 --> 23:46.560
making decisions about that.

23:46.560 --> 23:56.800
But so I'm imagining communist political institutions as a network of several layers of

23:56.800 --> 24:05.480
institutions that make decisions and where there's not a clear hierarchy of institutions

24:05.480 --> 24:09.160
in the way that we're used to from the nation state as we know it.

24:10.520 --> 24:20.080
So I think that if we use the word state to talk about what we know as the modern nation

24:20.080 --> 24:31.080
state, then we would have to abolish the state and design and construct new political

24:31.120 --> 24:33.120
institutions.

24:33.120 --> 24:39.240
If we use a broader notion of the state as basically any kind of political institution,

24:39.240 --> 24:47.280
then I would say that we need to come up with a new form of state, a new state power.

24:47.280 --> 24:51.800
But that's not really an answer to your question, is it?

24:51.800 --> 24:52.920
Well, that's totally fine.

24:52.920 --> 24:59.320
If you do not have this sketch of which kinds of institutions specifically would be needed

24:59.480 --> 25:06.280
and which kinds of tasks they would be able and necessary to perform, that's totally

25:06.280 --> 25:06.720
all right.

25:06.720 --> 25:12.280
I think it would be nonetheless good to kind of paint a little bit more of a picture of

25:12.280 --> 25:18.560
how you imagine this general set up to be, because there are some other aspects that

25:18.560 --> 25:20.600
you do define in your text.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.320
You write about communes.

25:22.320 --> 25:31.320
You write about that these communes should be ideally autark, more or less, even though,

25:31.320 --> 25:36.680
as you pointed towards in your last answer as well, even though there is the need for

25:36.680 --> 25:39.160
kind of higher level coordination as well.

25:39.160 --> 25:45.160
But you, at least in the text state, that you think this would be an ideal structure

25:45.160 --> 25:48.560
to have these communes to be more or less autark.

25:48.600 --> 25:54.560
You also write about a certain amount of work that people should perform.

25:54.560 --> 26:00.000
And I'm absolutely curious about getting to know whether or not this implies some form

26:00.000 --> 26:05.440
of compulsion to work, which is kind of implied, but not really made explicit.

26:05.840 --> 26:12.160
So there are other aspects to the way that you imagine this communist society to be

26:12.160 --> 26:14.520
organized that you do have ideas about.

26:14.520 --> 26:17.680
So maybe we could kind of get into those aspects as well.

26:19.560 --> 26:29.760
Yes, yeah, I use the word commune as a way of talking about what would be the basic

26:30.520 --> 26:36.120
institutional unit of communism.

26:36.840 --> 26:43.800
And ideally, every commune would have control over everything that the commune needs in

26:43.800 --> 26:51.240
order to secure a good and stable life for its communards, for the people who live in

26:51.240 --> 26:56.360
that commune. And the reason why I think that's an important principle is that it would

26:56.800 --> 27:05.720
make us less vulnerable to counterrevolutionary attempts to re-erect class society, for

27:05.760 --> 27:14.200
example, or other forms of also forms of concentration of power or corruption, something

27:14.200 --> 27:22.000
like that. If communes are not too dependent upon each other, then they would have

27:22.000 --> 27:28.040
more autonomy. And that means that if if something went wrong in one commune, it wouldn't

27:28.040 --> 27:34.760
necessarily the other communes would have a better basis for struggling against that or

27:35.520 --> 27:43.040
trying to avoid a concentration of power or corruption or counterrevolutionary

27:44.320 --> 27:45.320
movements and so on.

27:46.160 --> 27:55.760
Yet at the same time, you, I think, rightfully stress that there is actually by nature, you

27:55.760 --> 27:59.320
argue, a high level of interdependence.

27:59.360 --> 28:06.840
You know, and I when reading about this autarky aspect of the commune, even though I

28:06.840 --> 28:13.160
understand your argument as well, that it creates some kind of safety backup, so to

28:13.160 --> 28:17.840
speak, when it comes to attacks and stuff like that.

28:17.880 --> 28:25.600
But still, I was kind of a bit irritated about this falling back into this very strong

28:25.600 --> 28:32.960
notion of autonomy, because, as I said, really like the approach of emphasizing the

28:32.960 --> 28:39.240
interdependence. And this interdependence is also highly relevant when it comes to, like

28:39.240 --> 28:46.200
many, many of the aspects that will have to be addressed through each and every commune

28:46.200 --> 28:51.200
as well. You already talked about the question of resource use.

28:51.680 --> 28:59.800
I mean, if we do want to have some kind of meta level coordination when it comes to

28:59.800 --> 29:04.280
this question of resource use, which is kind of necessary if we want to, for example,

29:04.600 --> 29:12.280
address climate change and excessive resource use as it is being performed right now, then

29:12.280 --> 29:19.440
you immediately get into a situation where you will have to have functioning forms of

29:20.440 --> 29:24.160
mediation between these different levels, so to speak.

29:24.160 --> 29:32.640
So and there I would say I would argue this idea of autarky kind of goes against this

29:32.640 --> 29:38.920
grain, because the level in which this interdependence and therefore

29:38.920 --> 29:45.720
interconnection will have to be enacted is so much ingrained in each and every aspect

29:45.800 --> 29:51.400
of, for example, the production process, that it's very hard to imagine both of these

29:51.400 --> 29:56.880
same things at the same time, you know, this high, very high level of autonomy for each

29:57.240 --> 30:04.800
commune and kind of organizational coordination on a meta level when it comes to, for

30:04.800 --> 30:09.720
example, overall resource use, because these things are necessarily intertwined in a very,

30:09.720 --> 30:10.920
very intense way.

30:11.360 --> 30:19.560
So I was kind of struggling to imagine how highly autarky communes working next to each

30:19.560 --> 30:26.440
other, so to speak, but not really together as a default modus operandi, so to speak,

30:26.440 --> 30:34.040
how these autonomous communes would be able to to achieve this higher level coordination.

30:34.760 --> 30:39.640
I think that regarding the question of interdependence, I think that there's a

30:39.640 --> 30:46.000
fundamental difference between human individuals and political communities.

30:46.000 --> 30:54.360
I think humans are necessarily by nature social animals that are highly dependent upon

30:54.360 --> 31:01.680
each other. So the interdependence I speak about is the interdependence between human

31:01.680 --> 31:07.200
individuals, which is which is one of the reasons why, as I tried to explain earlier,

31:07.200 --> 31:15.120
that that's one of the reasons why human freedom must necessarily also consist in

31:17.240 --> 31:24.920
being able to participate in democratic political decision making processes.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.200
But the same point, that point about interdependence is not necessarily true of

31:30.200 --> 31:34.360
political communities, I would say of communities of human beings.

31:34.680 --> 31:40.400
Political communities are not necessarily dependent upon each other to the same degree.

31:41.920 --> 31:48.280
We are dependent on each other in the way that all political communities would live on

31:48.280 --> 31:50.520
the same planet and we would have to share that planet.

31:50.520 --> 31:55.880
And because of that, it would be necessary to have some sort of global regulation of the

31:55.880 --> 32:02.520
use of natural resources, for example, how it could, for example, take the form of

32:02.920 --> 32:09.200
quotas for CO2 quotas or something like that on a global level for each commune.

32:09.200 --> 32:16.360
And then each commune would decide how they would use that or all sorts of different

32:16.360 --> 32:19.160
quotas for the use of natural resources.

32:19.160 --> 32:22.280
And then it would be up to each commune to decide how to use that.

32:22.600 --> 32:29.560
So there is certainly an interdependence there that means that some sort of cooperation

32:29.560 --> 32:31.400
between communes would be necessary.

32:31.400 --> 32:45.160
But I think it would be a good idea to not to have a too high degree of division of labor

32:45.160 --> 32:51.160
between communes, for example, because interdependence and division of labor would

32:51.480 --> 32:59.160
always be a risk, because if one commune is dependent on something that another

32:59.160 --> 33:04.440
commune produces, then a power relationship of domination can easily arise.

33:05.320 --> 33:15.400
So in order to secure freedom and in order to counteract tendencies to inequality

33:15.400 --> 33:20.600
between communes and relationships of domination between communes, it would be important to

33:21.800 --> 33:24.360
maintain a high degree of autonomy, I would say.

33:25.960 --> 33:32.520
Because imagine, for example, that the commune you live in has decided not to produce

33:33.800 --> 33:40.280
medicine, for example, because there's a neighbor commune that produces a lot of

33:40.280 --> 33:41.240
medicine instead.

33:41.240 --> 33:46.520
And there's a division of labor where you and then you exchange or whatever you produce

33:46.520 --> 33:49.880
something else that that other commune needs.

33:50.840 --> 33:59.480
But then if there's something like a counterrevolutionary political force or movement

33:59.480 --> 34:04.360
in that other commune where all of the medicine you need in your commune is produced, then all

34:04.360 --> 34:11.800
of a sudden you would have to accept what they do or accept their demands or subject

34:11.800 --> 34:12.680
yourself to that.

34:12.760 --> 34:20.440
So you would be vulnerable in that sense if the commune you lived in don't have the

34:20.440 --> 34:23.240
resources to produce medicine for themselves, for example.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.920
How big of a commune do you imagine?

34:26.920 --> 34:32.920
So if you talk about communes as the smallest organizational unit, how big are these

34:32.920 --> 34:34.040
communes you think about?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.200
That's a really good question.

34:36.200 --> 34:40.360
And I think that communes could vary very much in size.

34:40.440 --> 34:47.880
I think one thing that's important to note here is that we would have to build

34:48.440 --> 34:55.560
communism on the basis of whatever capitalism has left us with, which means, for example,

34:55.560 --> 35:02.360
that we would have to build communism also in enormous urban areas with 20 million

35:02.360 --> 35:03.400
people, for example.

35:03.480 --> 35:12.360
So I would imagine, for example, that we would break up cities like Tokyo or Shanghai

35:12.360 --> 35:15.640
or New York into several communes.

35:16.520 --> 35:22.040
And one of the problems with an urban commune would be that it would be unable to produce

35:22.040 --> 35:23.080
its own food.

35:24.040 --> 35:31.560
So it would be a good idea, for example, to have communes that would extend from an urban

35:32.040 --> 35:39.880
area into a rural area in order to be able to produce everything the commune needs.

35:39.880 --> 35:50.840
But I imagine that communes in heavily urbanized areas would maybe have up to one or two

35:50.840 --> 35:53.640
million inhabitants or communists.

35:53.640 --> 36:00.840
But I also imagine that in other places, in very desolate areas with very few people,

36:00.840 --> 36:11.800
we could have quite large, in terms of area, large communes with maybe only 50,000

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
inhabitants or something like that.

36:13.800 --> 36:23.000
And there are so many different reasons why to draw the borders between communes.

36:23.080 --> 36:29.960
It could also be, for example, natural, like the landscape, the landscape could also be

36:29.960 --> 36:36.120
reasons for drawing borders between communes, mountains or rivers or things like that.

36:36.120 --> 36:46.840
So I think that we would, that the communes could very, very much incise from, for example,

36:46.840 --> 36:58.040
maybe from a few thousand people to millions of people.

36:59.880 --> 37:05.880
I think we kind of then circle back to this question of interdependence again, because

37:05.880 --> 37:13.960
I mean, for many things, I mean, if you want to build a computer, you will have to have

37:13.960 --> 37:22.760
minerals, many materials, knowledge, so many things that not every like two or five

37:22.760 --> 37:26.360
thousand people commune will be able to provide, obviously.

37:26.360 --> 37:32.120
So again, we are back to this question of interdependence and kind of impossibility

37:32.120 --> 37:37.400
of total autarky when it comes to many, many things, you know, infrastructural things

37:37.400 --> 37:45.400
like train connections that span, in this case, many communes for sure, because we would

37:45.400 --> 37:51.720
not want to kind of just get to the border of my commune and then have to change into

37:51.720 --> 37:54.360
another form of transportation, so to speak.

37:54.360 --> 38:00.920
So I mean, these are all, of course, questions that kind of pop up in this very atomized

38:02.200 --> 38:03.480
way of thinking about it.

38:03.560 --> 38:10.280
And if that would be a too big a problem, then I guess communes could decide to make

38:10.280 --> 38:17.240
one larger commune, like to fusion, is that the word, into a larger commune.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.320
Or they would maybe just accept that there are certain things that they are unable to

38:21.320 --> 38:27.000
produce. And because in such a situation people would be able to move freely between

38:27.000 --> 38:32.040
communes, then, you know, it would maybe also, we should maybe also think of that as a

38:32.040 --> 38:36.760
situation where there would be many different kinds of communes with many different forms

38:36.760 --> 38:45.400
of life and that maybe some people would prefer, you know, one way of living in a

38:45.400 --> 38:52.520
rural commune where you wouldn't have to work that much, but there would also be certain

38:52.520 --> 38:56.280
things that you wouldn't be able to have there.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.280
But you would always be able to move to another commune if you wanted to do that.

39:00.360 --> 39:05.480
Or the commune could also just, you know, it would be up to each commune to decide

39:08.440 --> 39:18.200
how much to depend on other communes or make agreements with other communes about

39:18.200 --> 39:20.200
exchanging things or whatever.

39:20.200 --> 39:25.400
Okay, maybe let's then dig a little deeper into this, because you just now mentioned

39:25.400 --> 39:30.840
exchange, so let's dig a little deeper into the planning process, because you do sketch

39:30.840 --> 39:32.840
some ideas within your text.

39:33.640 --> 39:39.240
Could you maybe run us through how you imagine a planning mechanism to go about?

39:39.960 --> 39:49.560
Yes, well, I think the first step is that we would have to make decisions about what we're

39:49.560 --> 39:52.840
going to take collective responsibility for producing.

39:52.840 --> 40:00.920
So, decisions about what to produce would have to be taken democratically in our political

40:00.920 --> 40:02.920
institutions in the commune.

40:02.920 --> 40:12.200
And then, and I imagine that that would, could, for example, take the form of different groups

40:12.200 --> 40:18.760
or organizations or that could submit proposals and that there would be some sort of, you

40:18.760 --> 40:28.920
know, public debate about that or, and then maybe several rounds of voting for those

40:28.920 --> 40:35.000
different plans, which would be plans for maybe a couple of years, let's say two years,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
for example.

40:37.000 --> 40:43.880
So, every second year we would vote for a new plan and that plan would basically be a

40:44.840 --> 40:50.840
proposal for what to take collective responsibility for producing.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.880
So, what to do with our common resources.

40:53.880 --> 41:01.880
And then through that political process, we would end up with a production plan and that

41:01.880 --> 41:12.360
would then have to be implemented and that could be translated to a certain amount of

41:12.360 --> 41:19.080
working hours, total working hours that would be distributed as a rule evenly among everyone.

41:19.080 --> 41:25.480
So, that's like the way I think about that in very broad terms.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.360
And would there then be a compulsion to work?

41:28.360 --> 41:31.000
We touched upon this, but didn't yet answer it.

41:31.000 --> 41:42.200
That's a good question and I think that I would love to be able to say no and that there would

41:42.200 --> 41:51.480
never be any form of, that in communism everyone would be able to do whatever they want

41:51.480 --> 41:59.720
all the time and that there would be no one forcing you to do anything, but I'm not sure.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.240
I think that's a realistic thing to say.

42:03.320 --> 42:14.200
So, it's a realistic scenario that some people might not live up to their duties all the time

42:14.200 --> 42:25.240
and I think that we would then have to discuss to what degree we would accept that

42:25.240 --> 42:31.400
because I could also imagine that it would also be possible just to calculate with that

42:31.400 --> 42:41.800
in a sense that there's a certain amount of people that wouldn't show up for work or

42:41.800 --> 42:49.400
something like that and maybe we could just accept that, but if it turns out that it has

42:50.040 --> 42:56.520
too many negative consequences in the long run, I think there would probably need to be

42:56.520 --> 43:04.840
some sort of, I'm not sure compulsion to work is the right way to describe it, but

43:05.640 --> 43:14.440
I could imagine, for example, that you could lose certain privileges if you don't take your

43:14.440 --> 43:21.560
share of collective responsibilities. I think that it's really important to, as I said earlier,

43:21.640 --> 43:28.520
to guarantee unconditional access to everything that people need to live a

43:30.520 --> 43:38.840
good, healthy, stable life, so unconditional access to housing and food, medicine,

43:39.880 --> 43:47.080
healthcare and so on, but imagine, for example, that we have collectively decided that everyone

43:47.720 --> 43:56.200
has the right to take a new education every 10 years, for example, then maybe that's a

43:56.760 --> 44:04.680
right that you could lose or imagine that there are waiting lists for certain, especially

44:04.680 --> 44:10.840
attractive housing, something like that, and then maybe if you don't show up for work,

44:11.800 --> 44:17.720
then you will lose your place on the waiting list for a housing or something like that.

44:17.720 --> 44:26.200
So there could be certain things that I'm not sure I would categorize that as or call that

44:26.200 --> 44:35.400
compulsion to work. Does that make sense? Yeah, kind of. I mean, I think for me the thing is that

44:35.400 --> 44:41.560
I would say that you end up with this dilemma, because I can sense that it's a dilemma for you

44:41.560 --> 44:48.920
as well, somehow it feels like it. And I think you end up with this dilemma because of this

44:49.560 --> 44:54.280
separation that you introduced, the separation between the realm of necessity and the realm

44:54.280 --> 45:01.000
of freedom. So maybe let's talk about that, because I think this is the source for why you then come

45:01.000 --> 45:07.240
to a point where you have this situation where you think that you need to discipline or incentivize,

45:07.240 --> 45:16.280
which is kind of a form of disciplining in a different way, so to speak. That's why you end

45:16.280 --> 45:22.360
up with this constellation where you think that you need to discipline people into doing certain

45:22.440 --> 45:31.960
types of work in order to use this remuneration or withholding of remuneration or benefits in

45:31.960 --> 45:38.760
order to steer, so to speak, the way in which things are being organized. So I think this is

45:38.760 --> 45:43.240
the root of it. So maybe let's talk about it. Could you maybe describe these different realms

45:43.240 --> 45:48.120
to us and why you believe this to be a sensible distinction? Well, it's a distinction

45:48.120 --> 46:01.240
that Marx makes, and I refer to Aaron Benenow when I mentioned it in the essay, but I'm not sure

46:01.240 --> 46:08.360
it's the best way to describe actually what I'm trying to describe there. So the idea is that

46:08.360 --> 46:15.080
there are certain needs that we agree politically to take collective responsibility for,

46:15.080 --> 46:23.080
and that's the public production. That would be what the commune decides to produce,

46:23.080 --> 46:27.320
what we decide together to produce in the commune, and to take responsibility for.

46:29.320 --> 46:35.560
So that's what we could call the realm of necessity, if we want to use that notion,

46:35.560 --> 46:46.520
because it's what we agree is necessary labor, necessary production. So it would obviously be,

46:46.520 --> 46:53.480
for example, production of food for everyone, production of medicine and housing and things

46:53.480 --> 47:01.080
like that. But there are a lot of things that would quite obviously be necessary for

47:01.160 --> 47:06.760
the commune to exist, and we would have to take care of that collectively. But then there are all

47:06.760 --> 47:13.400
sorts of products that we would not necessarily regard as a public responsibility to take care of.

47:14.360 --> 47:21.240
Maybe some people would suggest that we should build a piano factory,

47:21.240 --> 47:27.400
because we want to have pianos. But other people might have the opinion that, well,

47:27.400 --> 47:35.000
I would rather work less, because everything we would decide to produce would mean more work

47:35.000 --> 47:41.160
for everyone, because we would distribute work evenly. So everything we add to the list of what

47:41.160 --> 47:49.320
the commune produces would mean more work for everyone, because we would distribute work evenly.

47:49.480 --> 47:59.960
So it would always be a discussion about or a decision about what do we want to

48:00.520 --> 48:05.880
have more, less work, or do we want to have this or that product.

48:06.600 --> 48:11.240
And then we would disagree on that. So maybe some people would vote for a production plan that

48:11.240 --> 48:17.000
would include pianos and accept that everyone would have to work a little bit more, because

48:17.640 --> 48:22.600
we think it's nice to have pianos. And other people would maybe prefer not to work and then

48:22.600 --> 48:30.360
not to have pianos. And then whatever the result would be, the commune would not necessarily

48:30.360 --> 48:39.000
produce everything that people want. So there will be a lot of needs that will not be met,

48:39.000 --> 48:45.080
or a lot of wants that will not be met by the production that is organized by the commune.

48:45.080 --> 48:51.880
And what are we going to do about that? Well, it's obvious, I think, to say that people

48:51.880 --> 48:58.360
would be, if they can, they would be free to produce that in their free time outside of the

48:58.360 --> 49:07.800
work organized by the commune. So that's kind of like the basis for distinguishing between

49:08.760 --> 49:13.400
the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom. The realm of necessity is the

49:15.480 --> 49:21.560
all of the things we agree are necessary to produce together and that we take collective

49:21.560 --> 49:29.000
responsibility for producing. And as a political community and the realm of freedom is whatever we

49:29.000 --> 49:39.080
want to use all of us, all of the rest of our time, whatever we want to use that for. And it's

49:39.080 --> 49:43.400
important here to know that the realm of freedom would be much larger in

49:44.920 --> 49:49.240
counting in hours and we would have more free time.

49:52.280 --> 50:03.400
Yeah. I want to add that I'm not sure that those terms, the realm of necessity and the realm of

50:03.400 --> 50:09.240
freedom are the best way to describe that. And maybe that's what some of what you were

50:09.240 --> 50:15.960
thinking about when you asked me about this, that I just said earlier that organizing

50:17.720 --> 50:22.920
the economy by means of democratic decision making would be the best thing to do with

50:22.920 --> 50:32.120
one society with as high a degree of freedom as possible. So in a sense that is wrong to oppose

50:34.040 --> 50:40.840
that to freedom. Right. Absolutely. I would agree with that with the last statement. That's why

50:40.840 --> 50:46.520
I think it's an unlucky separation because for me when reading the text I always thought,

50:46.520 --> 50:53.560
what? Wait a second. What you're describing as the realm of necessity is the realm of freedom

50:53.560 --> 51:02.760
since it produces freedom as such. And also through this separation of realm of

51:02.760 --> 51:07.400
necessity and realm of freedom, you get into a position where you kind of reproduce

51:07.400 --> 51:16.600
a certain notion of labor, not only work, but labor, meaning that something that I do not want to do,

51:16.600 --> 51:21.800
but have to do. And this has all kinds of consequences in terms of motivation, in terms of

51:22.600 --> 51:29.560
effectiveness and stuff like that. So I would argue that one would need to approach

51:30.040 --> 51:34.680
what you call the realm of necessity also from a perspective through which

51:35.640 --> 51:42.280
what you have to do in order to reproduce is not just a kind of labor you have to do because you

51:42.280 --> 51:51.000
are being forced to, but is also a part of a perspective that sees this work as absolutely,

51:51.640 --> 51:56.600
I wanted to say logic, but that's maybe the wrong word, as a necessary part of reproduction

51:57.320 --> 52:03.320
that is not separated into a kind of alienating thing to do, so to speak,

52:04.680 --> 52:12.600
maybe to be a bit polemic about it, I would say. So I'm kind of against these different splits.

52:12.600 --> 52:22.120
I can definitely see why you're against that. I think maybe it's good to remind ourselves

52:22.120 --> 52:28.040
why Marx uses these words. And I think it's because when he talks about realm of necessity,

52:28.040 --> 52:34.280
I think he's talking about a kind of natural necessity here, the fact that human beings are

52:35.160 --> 52:43.000
forced to work if we want to live. And I think Marx is right in that one of the fundamental

52:43.000 --> 52:48.120
aspects of human beings is, and he says this already in his early writings in the German

52:48.120 --> 52:52.600
Ideologie, that what distinguishes human beings from other animals is that they produce,

52:52.600 --> 52:59.080
that we are forced to transform our surroundings in order to be able to live of them. So

52:59.080 --> 53:05.080
human beings, we have to work in order to live. We have to transform our surroundings in order

53:05.080 --> 53:11.320
to be able to live off those surroundings. And that is a natural necessity. And that's why

53:12.040 --> 53:19.960
he calls it the realm of necessity, right? And then the more productive we can get,

53:19.960 --> 53:27.720
the less time we need to do that, or also depending on the natural conditions of where we live.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.920
If you live in certain areas, certain places on the earth, it would require more work to

53:35.880 --> 53:40.840
to be able to survive than in other places. But the basic fact is that there is a certain

53:40.840 --> 53:47.320
amount of work that is necessary in order to live. And that's a natural necessity. And that's why

53:47.320 --> 53:53.240
Marx calls it the realm of necessity. And in opposition to that, the rest of your time you

53:53.240 --> 54:02.120
can use to do whatever you want. And that's the realm of freedom. So I think maybe the reason why,

54:03.080 --> 54:10.520
or the source of confusion or disagreement here is maybe that we're maybe confusing

54:11.080 --> 54:18.120
a natural necessity and freedom with political necessity and political freedom,

54:18.120 --> 54:23.800
if that makes sense. Yeah, kind of. But also, I think the way that you use the realm of necessity

54:23.800 --> 54:30.680
is not the way that you described it right now. So it's not the Marxian notion of subsistence. So

54:30.680 --> 54:37.480
the basic level of what you have to do in order to reproduce yourself as a physical,

54:38.360 --> 54:45.400
biological object, so to speak. So you use it in a very different way, which is encompassing

54:45.960 --> 54:52.280
much more than just subsistence. And then, and I think this kind of complicates this as well,

54:52.280 --> 54:58.920
you use these words private sector and public sector. So you use public sector for the realm

54:58.920 --> 55:04.440
of necessity and then private sector for the realm of freedom, so to speak. And I mean,

55:04.440 --> 55:13.160
this also adds another layer of confusion in that it kind of runs the danger of sounding as if you

55:13.160 --> 55:20.360
wanted to say that the private sector, in which you also state that there will possibly still be

55:20.360 --> 55:26.120
markets, exchange, et cetera, that this is the realm of freedom. And it quickly sounds

55:26.760 --> 55:33.800
like this liberal talking point where markets are equated with freedom and planning is

55:33.800 --> 55:39.320
basically tyranny and obligation, so to speak, which is definitely not what you wanted to state.

55:39.320 --> 55:44.840
And it is absolutely clear reading the text that this is not what you wanted to say. But

55:44.840 --> 55:51.720
I just think that this terminology, this additional terminology of public sector and

55:51.720 --> 55:57.640
private sector also kind of feeds into the misunderstanding, I would say. Yeah.

55:58.680 --> 56:01.960
Yeah, I think you're right about that. And there's obviously

56:04.360 --> 56:10.360
a risk that, well, because public and private sector are concepts that we also use about

56:11.880 --> 56:19.880
the capitalist economy, then there's a risk of thinking that what I'm describing

56:19.880 --> 56:23.880
there would be something that's similar to how the capitalist economy works, which is

56:23.880 --> 56:31.320
not what I'm trying to do, but not what I'm trying to say there. So I'm open to suggestions

56:31.320 --> 56:38.280
for a better way of making this distinction, because I think it is an important distinction

56:38.280 --> 56:45.480
to make. And so in a communist mode of production, we would make democratic decisions

56:45.480 --> 56:50.440
about what to produce. But what about all the things that we would decide not to produce?

56:51.000 --> 57:00.120
I mean, I could see myself voting for a production plan that would mean that a lot of things that

57:00.120 --> 57:05.480
some people would like to have would not be produced. And what do we say to those people who

57:05.480 --> 57:12.440
would then would like to have those products? I mean, the thing in capitalism is that Marx puts

57:12.440 --> 57:20.520
it somewhere in capital that money is basically a technology for transforming

57:20.520 --> 57:25.720
a social power into the power of the individual, something like that. He says something about

57:25.720 --> 57:31.800
carrying social power in your pocket or something like that. Because what you can do in capitalism

57:31.800 --> 57:37.640
is that if you have money, then you can basically decide what will happen to some of our

57:37.640 --> 57:46.360
collective resources. Because demand on the market is what determines what gets produced,

57:46.360 --> 57:57.560
right? And that power of the individual in capitalism, that money allows you as an

57:57.560 --> 58:03.480
individual to decide what gets produced. You wouldn't have that in a communist society,

58:03.480 --> 58:10.360
because that's the problem with capitalism, that it's people who have money who decide.

58:11.720 --> 58:18.040
So we would replace that with collective democratic decision making. And that would mean

58:18.040 --> 58:21.880
that there would be a lot of things that we would maybe not take collective responsibility

58:21.880 --> 58:26.600
for producing. And what do we do about that? I think it's not a good answer to say, well,

58:26.600 --> 58:34.280
people just have to accept that we're not going to produce pianos or other things that some

58:34.280 --> 58:44.040
people would maybe think would be luxury products. And I think it's better to say that people would

58:44.040 --> 58:50.040
have the possibility of producing that in their free time. And they could also find other people

58:50.040 --> 58:55.160
who would also like pianos and produce pianos together and then make some kind of private

58:55.160 --> 59:02.040
piano producing factory, if that's what they want. I mean, why shouldn't they not be able to

59:02.040 --> 59:06.680
that? Why should we ban that? And of course, that would require some resources, because you need a

59:06.680 --> 59:11.080
lot of things in order to build pianos. And where would you get those resources from? You would

59:11.080 --> 59:15.080
obviously have to get them from the commune. So again, the commune would have to make decisions

59:15.080 --> 59:21.400
about which resources to give to private production. But I think it's important to

59:22.360 --> 59:29.960
acknowledge that if we are going to have a democratically planned economy, there would be a

59:29.960 --> 59:34.920
lot of things that would not get produced, a lot of needs that would not be met by

59:35.800 --> 59:41.960
our collective production. And we would have to find a way of letting people

59:43.240 --> 59:50.360
having those needs met in other ways. So that's a way of saying that there

59:50.360 --> 59:56.760
would be production also outside of what the commune organizes. The production organized

59:56.760 --> 01:00:04.040
by the commune would not be all production that there is in society. So we need some sort of

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:09.320
distinction there. We need a concept to distinguish between those two forms of production.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.160
Yeah, I mean, there are different questions attached to that. If you say that what you call

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:21.160
the private sector will need to get some forms of resources, I think then you'll quickly get to

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:29.640
the point where one might say, okay, why then not just include this as a need into the collective

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:38.200
process? Why funnel these resources into a market system, so to speak, in order to be able to

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:46.120
produce piano? So we can have mechanisms that allow for the detection of needs that are not yet

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:54.040
met. We can develop mechanisms that are able to provide some form of plus X that might be some

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.840
form of luxury goods. So there should be some mechanisms. I absolutely agree with you. There

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:06.120
should be some mechanisms in place that are able to kind of address these extra needs, so to speak.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:12.520
I'm not quite sure whether this automatically implies that you will have to have a form of

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:20.600
classical market system, you know, with some form of money, some form of value form and all the

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.360
things that go along with this, because at least to me it sounded as if what you describe as a

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.640
private sector would then probably have all of these things in order to be able to produce

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:43.320
this plus X. And my argument would be there can be creative ways of integrating this absolutely

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:52.600
valid need for the plus X into forms of democratic planning as well. So it's not about a rigid system

01:01:52.600 --> 01:02:00.840
that does not have any ability to change, to include, to have realms of freedom within

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:07.320
what we consider the collective mechanism, I would argue. And also just as a note,

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.320
it might be interesting for you to take a look at David Leibman's model of multi-level

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.880
democratic iterative coordination, because he does have some kind of setup similar to that,

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:25.320
because he imagines a core sector which is run through this mechanism, the MDIC mechanism,

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.120
and then he imagines that there will be some form of kind of peripheral sector,

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:39.080
which will have probably some market mechanisms as well, but which might bit by bit also be

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:46.840
integrated over time into the MDIC system. So just as a note. But we do not have that much

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:54.280
time left and I have so many questions left. So I would have to pick and choose. I mean, maybe

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.760
before we get to the final question that I ask all of my guests, maybe let's get back to this

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:07.560
very high level of abstraction that you, I think, very brilliantly look at in your book Mute

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:13.800
Compulsion, because there you describe the fact that capitalism, in order to reproduce itself,

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:20.920
it does not only rely on ideology and violence, but also on mute compulsion or what you call

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:29.160
economic power. So I'm quite interested in the question, which kind of alternatives

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.400
a communism would have to provide in order to address these different fields that now

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:42.280
guarantee the reproduction of capitalism. So to frame it a bit more clearly, hopefully,

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:52.120
what kinds of mechanisms of reproduction of reproducing itself would communism need to have

01:03:52.120 --> 01:04:00.200
in order to produce this stability and yeah, in order to reproduce itself maybe,

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:08.360
because I think we could go one by one through violence, ideology and economic power and ask

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:16.360
ourselves, okay, now this is in capitalism, this is handled through these three powers,

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:21.560
so to speak, but which kinds of powers would communism need to have in order to reproduce

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:32.040
itself? Well, I think that there would not be something similar to violence in communism,

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.000
because I mean, capitalism relies on violence, especially the violence of the state.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:47.960
Without a state that guarantees private property, for example, through the use of violence in the

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:54.280
form of police and military, capitalism would not be possible. So in capitalism we have a

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.400
situation where the economic system is dependent upon the constant use of violence or the threat

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:08.120
of violence for reproducing itself. That would not be necessary in a communist society, but

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.960
that does not mean that I don't think that there would be any form of violence in

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.760
communism. I think there would still be all sorts of aggression between people and we would

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:25.000
have to find a way to take care of that and that would probably mean also that we would have to

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.520
accept that the commune would be able to use violence towards individual people in order to

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.560
force them to stop doing something like beating someone else, for example.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:47.800
Private relationships or violence in that way, but that is not the same as violence as an

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:56.280
integrated element in the economic system. There wouldn't be anything similar to that in

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:06.280
communism. Regarding the question of ideology, I think that's very different. Your question

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:17.080
reminds me of a quote by Louis Althusser in his essay about Marxism and Humanism,

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:26.600
which I really like. There's a passage about ideology where he speaks about what is the role

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.600
of ideology and would there be any kind of ideology in a communist society, in a classless society?

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:37.240
I think he has a very nice way of putting that, so I'm just going to read that quote

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:43.960
because I just found it. He writes that, and I quote, in a class society ideology is the

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.960
relay whereby and the element in which the relation between men and their condition of existence

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:57.080
is settled to the profit of the ruling class. In a classless society ideology is the relay whereby

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:01.400
and the element in which the relation between men and their conditions of existence is lived to the

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:13.400
profit of all men. So I think that ideology is in a sense, ideology is something that will always

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:19.720
exist. The thing is that ideology is, and he's using a broad notion of ideology here because

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:25.720
this implies that ideology is not necessarily always a form of domination. It can also be

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.760
a concept that merely describes how

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:42.040
the way we understand ourselves and our surroundings are affected by our social world

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:49.640
and that can also contribute to reproducing social forms that are not domination or

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:58.040
hierarchies or something like that. So in a class society and in capitalism ideology has the

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:05.640
function of reproducing class society, reproducing capitalism, but we could definitely imagine that

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:10.200
in a communist society there would be ideological forms that would

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.600
help reproducing a free society and avoid re-erecting class society.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.040
And then there's the question of whether there would be something similar to

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:33.080
economic power in communism. And I think that when I talk about economic power in capitalism

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:39.320
it's always a form of domination. And in that sense the whole point of

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:45.480
abolishing capitalism and building communism is to get rid of domination. But economic power

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.440
reveals something about a unique capacity that human beings have to organize.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:58.600
We can organize our material surroundings in a way that helps to reproduce certain social

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:05.240
relations. In capitalism those social relations are relations of domination. But it's possible to

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:12.760
think about how in a communist society we could organize our material surroundings in a way that

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:21.880
could help reproduce communism. Or we could think about how could we organize our

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:31.080
material conditions of existence in a way that counteracts tendencies towards domination or

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:38.600
concentration of power, for example. That could be, for example, as we talked about, ensuring a high

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:47.000
degree of local autonomy or autonomy in each commune by giving priority to that above,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.720
for example, productivity and division of labor. Because a high degree of division of labor would

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:59.480
maybe mean higher productivity, less working hours for everyone, less work for everyone.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.560
But it could also have the consequence that it would make society more vulnerable to power

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.640
concentration. So there would be a trade-off and we would have to make some

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:19.160
sort of decision about that. So in that sense, if we think of economic power in a broader way as

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.400
externalizing social relations in our material conditions of existence or material and social

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:31.960
surroundings, then there would be something similar to that. We could think of using that

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:41.720
capacity, that unique capacity of human beings to work for communist ends in communism.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.280
And then, Sören, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests and it is,

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.000
if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.920
It makes me joyful to imagine how daily life could be under communism,

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:01.720
to imagine, to work much less and also to imagine that we could have a totally different way of

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.120
organizing the division of labor, where maybe I wouldn't just have one function or one job

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.880
my entire life. Maybe I could have more than one function at the same time. So one day a week I

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.320
could do one thing and then another day in the week I could do something else. And I would maybe have

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.160
the opportunity to specialize in something new after a couple of years or do that throughout

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:41.720
my life. And then, of course, it makes me joyful to imagine not to never have to be worried about

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:54.920
money and to know that I would have a secure basis of existence, that I would have a place to live

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:01.320
and something to eat and everything that I would need in order to have a good life without

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.960
having to worry about how the economy is developing and what will happen in the next crisis

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:12.360
and whether I will lose my job and will I be able to pay my rent and

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.520
stuff like that. That makes me very joyful to think about.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.320
