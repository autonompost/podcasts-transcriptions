00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to Future Histories.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
My name is Jan Gross, and it is my great pleasure to welcome Elisa Longcón,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,440
Auntie Leo, in today's episode.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,960
She's a linguist and professor in the Department of Education at the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,800
University of Santiago de Chile, and she has been the first president of

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,080
the Constitutional Convention in Chile.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,920
Just like the very recent episode with Matt Huber, I also recorded today's

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,600
episode at the The Great Transition Conference, where I was invited to

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,520
take part in a symposium on democratic planning.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,680
Many thanks to everybody involved.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,360
It has been a great pleasure to be able to meet so many interesting people there.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
I really enjoyed it.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,600
A little pointer to my German speaking audience.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,840
I think today's episode connects really nicely to the second

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,320
episode I recorded with Daniel Leuch.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,400
That would be episode 39 of season two of Future Histories, titled

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Daniel Leuch zu Freiheit, Souveränität und Recht ohne Gewalt.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,600
And then a little pointer to my English speaking audience as well.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,120
You do have the possibility to subscribe to the English episodes only.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,720

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,960
But now please enjoy today's episode with Elisa Longcón Antilio.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Welcome, Elisa.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,920
Hi, my name is Elisa Longcón Antilio.

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,560
Hello to everybody.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,720
I'm greeting you in my mother tongue.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,280
That is very important for me and for my people that you hear my

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,960
voice in my mother tongue, because we are a virginal nation here in Chile.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,800
And our language is losing today.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,560
So it's our role to recover it.

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,200
Thank you to invite me to attend this meeting.

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,760
It's a great pleasure.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,920
Thank you for being here.

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,800
For those who don't know anything about the constitutional process that has been

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,480
started in Chile in 2020, could you give us an overview of the process that was

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,480
set up for the collective development of the new Chilean constitution?

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,440
What was special about it?

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Yeah, I want to tell you that it was a very important process for

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,200
a lot of the Chilean people.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:04,200
It didn't start at 2020 because it's born from the social movement.

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:13,560
Long time ago, I want to mention 2006 with a student from high school.

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,960
They initiate a very big demands for public education at that time.

47
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:32,760
So the student from university, they was also in the mobilization and call all of

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,000
the social Chilean movement.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:45,480
So we had a very, very hard social situation in 2019.

50
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:54,040
Million of people took the streets at that time, demanding social rights for the people.

51
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:04,040
So the government and the parliament called for a special meeting in order to establish

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:13,080
an accord, a political accord to have a referendum to change the Pinochet constitution.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,960
So they did it.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:25,160
And then in 2021, we created the first Constituent's Assembly.

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:37,280
That included a hundred and fifty five conventional and that include also the

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:47,720
priority, also the indigenous nations and all the social movements and political parties.

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:58,080
So we started to to wrote the new constitution and in one year we got it.

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,600
And then we have a new referendum in order to approve or refuse the proposal.

59
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,760
That proposal included the right for nature, right for indigenous people,

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,960
parity in the women, equality between women and men, social rights and all of them for all of the

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
aboriginal nation too.

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:31,560
So, but we had a bigger difficult situation because the citizenship rejected the new

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,600
proposal. It was rejected in September 4th last year.

64
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:54,000
But the main topic, why it was rejected was the fake news, hate discourses, the people who are in

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,840
the rejection position, they create a lot of misinformation about the constituent process,

66
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,200
about the conventionals and people fear to give the votes for that new constitution.

67
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,440
Some of the fake news was they said that they will lost the house.

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,360
There is no right for to have a house.

69
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:33,760
There is no right to have, for instance, social security or they said that the indigenous people

70
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:42,680
want to divide Chile and the indigenous people hate the Chilean people.

71
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,360
So those were hate discourses and people have feared about that.

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,240
So they rejected the constitution, the new proposal that we wrote at that time.

73
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:09,320
So the government called for a meeting with the parliament and they decided to improve the process

74
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,680
and call for the second constitutional process.

75
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:22,000
We are today in the second constitutional process, but they modify the representation of the people

76
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:33,440
because they include a no democratic way to to vote, to elect the conventionals.

77
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:43,560
And they decide that half of all of the team that will wrote the constitution,

78
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,640
that they must be designated by political parties.

79
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,880
There wasn't a democracy process.

80
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,120
So they they decided to include people from political parties,

81
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,000
exclude the indigenous people.

82
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:17,800
And then there was we had a new referendum to to vote for the half 50, 51, a conventional again.

83
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:27,600
We had it just two weeks ago and but there was not a special seat for indigenous.

84
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:37,920
The indigenous people elected one Mapuche person to to represent the the indigenous

85
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,400
interests inside the second process.

86
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:56,800
But the designated conventional, they are today as assessor, political is a political teams

87
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,040
experimenting in contention in constitution.

88
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:13,120
They draw the the proposal and inside that proposal, there wasn't there was not people.

89
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,040
There were no there were people, indigenous people inside the design.

90
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:30,520
So in that second frame, there is no participation of indigenous people today.

91
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:40,520
The elected people from the council, they will review that proposal, the second proposal.

92
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:51,400
But we don't we are not agree with the misrepresentation of the indigenous people.

93
00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:02,040
And we will have a next at the end of this year, we will have the new referendum to in order to

94
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,440
decide if we approve or we reject the new proposal.

95
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,520
The new proposal today, we don't know how that's that proposal will include indigenous

96
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,080
right or mother nature rights or women's rights.

97
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,720
Those are the more difficult topic for the conservative parties.

98
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,280
Today, the voice is for the conservative parties.

99
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,640
Were there special obstacles within the process for the Chilean constitution?

100
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,080
Because if I remember correctly, I think in Bolivia, for example, they had a constitutional

101
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,160
process, and it was different than the one in Chile.

102
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,040
And if I remember correctly, then I think in some talk that you gave you, I think you stated

103
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,800
that the way that it was set up, that there was a referendum after the process with a with

104
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,320
this certain percentage that would have to be reached, that this was a special obstacle

105
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,280
within the process for the Chilean constitution.

106
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,640
Is that right? Am I remembering this correctly, or is it was it a very regular process, the

107
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
way it was set up in Chile?

108
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,560
No, there is there is not a regular process in Chile.

109
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,000
The constitutional discussion is a democratic constitutional discussion is a new process

110
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:44,880
today in Chile, because the last constitution was written by the dictatorship regime without

111
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,640
social participation.

112
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:56,400
So this is the last process that we did from twenty twenty one.

113
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,720
It was a really new process because included all of the social movement.

114
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:12,480
It was for the first time in the history of Chilean society that a half part of the

115
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,960
conventional were women, for instance.

116
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,560
There is no constitution written by women in any in here and outside of Chile.

117
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,760
So that is was a very, very important.

118
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,640
And that is that was the difference between the Bolivian process, the Bolivian constitutional

119
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:42,640
process or Ecuador, a constitutional process, because here the the participation of women

120
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:51,440
was really were in equal relationship between women and men in that first process.

121
00:12:51,640 --> 00:13:00,120
But today seem are very different because the this expert commission elected by political

122
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:11,960
party, they avoid all of the topic that we included in the first process.

123
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,320
So today is really different from the first process.

124
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:28,640
And one thing that is also very important is in the first process, we include the plurinationality.

125
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:41,000
The plurinationality is a political proposal that born in the Bolivian process, also from

126
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,240
Ecuador process, the indigenous people there, they they they speak about the plurinationality.

127
00:13:49,280 --> 00:14:00,120
And we as we are also Chile is have a diversity of nation nation here.

128
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:09,280
So we included like plurinationality as the political way to resolve the conflict between

129
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:20,120
the state and indigenous people to overcome genocide, racism, damage, coexistence, also

130
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:29,320
to recover all of the collective rights, because there is no political solution from

131
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:41,640
the state to resolve ancestral or historical problem that that did the creation of the

132
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:49,880
states with aboriginal nation, aboriginal nation didn't participate in the creation of

133
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:57,880
the states. So for the first time, we included and we said, OK, we are different.

134
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,800
There are diversity of nation here.

135
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,200
So all together will define the framework, the constitution for all of the Chilean people.

136
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,440
So that is what's really strong and very important.

137
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:21,640
But in this second process, they avoid the plurinationality because they said that the

138
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,280
people rejected. But I told you that people rejected because of hate discourse.

139
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,760
It was not true that we are going we hope to divide Chile.

140
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,400
We need a relationship, equal relationship with Chilean society.

141
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
That's all.

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,520
And when it comes to plurinationality, how does that work if there are like conflicting

143
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,320
rights, since if there are different nations within the nation, so to speak, and these

144
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,000
different nations have different ideas of, for example, how the question of rights should

145
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,840
be approached? Is there a way how to address it when there are different opinions that

146
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,480
clash with each other?

147
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:16,800
Because I imagine it wouldn't be a good idea to simply overrule one over the other.

148
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,880
But there needs to be a process of getting to an understanding of the different forms

149
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,320
of how rights are being conceptualized within the nations in the nation.

150
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm not sure if this was a question that can be understood.

151
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:43,680
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, I understand your question because people fear about the plurinationality

152
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:53,440
when they think that the indigenous will use the rights of the non-indigenous people.

153
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:06,120
And the question they did is, does the indigenous will have more rights than non-indigenous

154
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:17,720
people? You know, but there is no problem inside if you understand a lot of problem

155
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,720
that we had along the history with the indigenous.

156
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:33,760
The plurinationality first supports that Chilean society must recognize the pre-existence

157
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:43,520
of the indigenous because we were first here in that territory, then came the state.

158
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,720
The second point is, it's different to think about nations and state.

159
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,880
The state, it's an organization of nation.

160
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,960
But what happened with the internal colonialism inside the Chilean state?

161
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:15,960
They organized the state just with the white point of view, without the point of view of

162
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:24,640
indigenous people. So we have a long violation of human rights inside of our country.

163
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:35,080
We have genocide, the colonial project settled here in Chile and in America.

164
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:43,960
It was a genocide project that killed a nation, an aboriginal nation.

165
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,800
Not only nation, not only killed physically, they killed our culture, our language and

166
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,560
deprived us about our human rights.

167
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:06,760
We were not included as human inside the creation of the state from the beginning.

168
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:18,200
They said that we were like people from pre-logic, primitive, without conscience.

169
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,440
A lot of work in order to avoid our rights.

170
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:34,840
So your question is, we are in the 21st century and we are still alive today.

171
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,080
I am a teacher in the university.

172
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,360
I work every day with a Chilean student.

173
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,880
You know, my neighbor are Chileans.

174
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,480
So we need an equal relationship between them.

175
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:02,800
States, governments, after the dictatorship regime, they recognized that there was a

176
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,960
problem, historical problem, injustice problem inside of our state with indigenous people.

177
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,920
They create a law, they create a special commission in order to resolve that problem.

178
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,200
They vote in favor of the United Nations Declaration for Indigenous People, for

179
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,640
instance, or ELO Convention.

180
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:36,040
Our governments here give the votes in order to accept that ELO Convention that speaks

181
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,360
about a political right of indigenous people.

182
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,520
So, but what happened here in the country?

183
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:54,720
They, they erase the rights that they recognize internationally.

184
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:04,320
So what we need, we need those rights to be practices inside the country, inside the

185
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
society, and we need to live our rights.

186
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:16,320
I speaking about collective rights because they are individual rights and also collective

187
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
rights. Our rights are collective rights.

188
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,200
For instance, language is a collective rights because I can speak my language.

189
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,760
If I have, if I find somebody that is speaking my language, I need the collective.

190
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,480
Community is a collective right.

191
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,760
We the indigenous, we live in community.

192
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,800
We live with our family.

193
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,840
We have a big family because it connected with the community.

194
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
That is our collective right.

195
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,960
Autonomy and self-determination.

196
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
It's also a collective rights.

197
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,520
All of them was, were recognized by our governments.

198
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,480
So what we need today, we need to include it inside the law in order to live our right,

199
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,440
in order to, to, to be recognized as people, as human, you know?

200
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,760
So that's the topic that the Chilean people need to understand.

201
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,640
Those rights is not again the Chilean because we, we had our territory, but our

202
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,600
territory was occupied, but we need our territory in order to live and government

203
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,880
and a state have international instruments in order to solve that problem.

204
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,240
We need them, we needed to implement it.

205
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,760
And we are here talking about that topic in order to help to implement it.

206
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,440
The right, those rights collective that in our territory in democratic way.

207
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
This is the plural nationality.

208
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,640
So to resolve historical problem that have the state with the indigenous people in our

209
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,920
territory, using the democratic way of solution.

210
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,480
Very interesting.

211
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,880
One of the questions that I was asking myself when preparing is that on a certain level

212
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:32,440
that there seems to be a form of contradiction because you propose to use this element of a

213
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,520
constitution, of a constitutional convention in this case, of a constitution, which comes out

214
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,920
of a certain political tradition, a tradition of political theory as well.

215
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,240
And it is closely tied, for example, to a specific notion of subjects is and it's a

216
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,240
Western notion of subjects, a subject of reason.

217
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,600
You already pointed towards this, that is kind of underlying this notion of a

218
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,880
constitution as well.

219
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,600
And this is, of course, not unproblematic, because as you pointed out, indigenous people

220
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,120
were for a long time excluded from this notion of subject.

221
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,240
And I was wondering how these things can be brought together, because while there are

222
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:27,000
certainly aspects within this notion of subject that have served as a carrier, so to speak,

223
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,040
for also emancipatory projects, for example, broadly speaking, within a left humanist

224
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,040
project throughout history, this notion of subject has, of course, also been used as a

225
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,720
carrier for forms of domination and subjugation of other humans and also of nature.

226
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,720
So this has been an instrument of exclusion and oppression as well.

227
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,480
So my question would be, how can then a constitution, which is, as I said, an element of

228
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:10,120
Western political philosophy, you know, how can a constitution be thought of and enacted

229
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:18,200
without having to rely on this specific notion of a, let's say, liberal subject?

230
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,280
Yeah, yes.

231
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:34,360
So for us, I think that for all of the social movements around the world, we need to

232
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:43,080
understand that there is no, we are still keeping historical problems.

233
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:59,720
And the right wing, left wing, they promised to all of the society from all of the continent

234
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,000
that they will resolve the problem that we have in the society.

235
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,720
I'm speaking about Eurocentric philosophy.

236
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm speaking about capitalism and about Marxism.

237
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:27,720
The idea of progress that it came to our continent is a political idea.

238
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,280
It's not an economical project.

239
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,400
It's an ideological project.

240
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:49,720
And European people believe at that time that with that solution, the progress inside of

241
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,240
our continent, they will solve the problem that we have here.

242
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,280
But progress never come to our territory.

243
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,000
Indigenous people, we are still, we are living without our rights.

244
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,160
I told you our collective rights.

245
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,720
Progress also doesn't solve the women rights.

246
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,920
Women were sacrificed by the progress ideology.

247
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,320
Indigenous was sacrificed by the progress ideology.

248
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:41,480
Nature was sacrificed by progress philosophy because they need to exploit it in order to

249
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,560
give social security for the people.

250
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,600
And that is not true because we don't, we are living without social security.

251
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,720
Indigenous people, there is no recognition of the right of women, for instance.

252
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:16,360
Women was considered like an inferior human from men, and men decide for women from the beginning.

253
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,920
I'm speaking about 1492 when the Spaniards came to our continent.

254
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,760
They did it in order to have a modernity in our continent.

255
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,920
But they sacrifice for the progress, sacrifice the people for the progress.

256
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:52,920
And Marxist ideology didn't say we have a violation of human rights

257
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,640
with that ideology.

258
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
They support the progress.

259
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,200
They support the progress because they said bourgeois are making progress.

260
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,120
We need that progress in order to resolve the, to have in the future unclass society.

261
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,320
But we need the progress.

262
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:21,000
They don't discuss the deep philosophy that was inside the progress.

263
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,840
Again, indigenous, again, against women.

264
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Today we have those problems in everywhere.

265
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,320
So what we need today, we need to rethink about what we did in the past,

266
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:47,240
what the European culture did or philosophy, European philosophy did for all of the continent

267
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,720
because the progress born from Europe, it doesn't born from Africa.

268
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,120
It doesn't born from Latin America.

269
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,440
It was born in Europe.

270
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,280
And they use the ideology for all of the world.

271
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,800
Today the problem is in everywhere, in all the continent.

272
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,600
There is no solution for those, our rights.

273
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,240
So what we need today, we are in the 21st century.

274
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,520
We need to talk together.

275
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:30,440
We need to include diversity way of thinking because the colonial European Eurocentric

276
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,280
way of thinking doesn't give the solution to our problems.

277
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:42,120
And we support that there are philosophy, there are political models

278
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,760
or communitarian systems in our territory, inside of our society.

279
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:58,120
So we need to recover it in order to find together a plural solution

280
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,400
and include the plurality inside the democracy.

281
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,160
Because the democracies is defined by white people

282
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:14,920
and is defined by the idea of progress and democracy is still making sacrifice

283
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,680
of our people and also in everywhere.

284
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,080
So we need to modify our conception of state, our conception of constitution.

285
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,840
The way how to modify it is including the diversity, including different philosophy,

286
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,880
including all of our rights as human, individual and collective rights,

287
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,840
and also women's rights, but also nature rights.

288
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,240
Because we have other philosophy.

289
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,160
Indigenous people, we believe that nature is alive.

290
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:02,680
For instance, hers is alive and we need to be in relationship with nature.

291
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:15,080
And that's way of thinking is not include the right wing, neither in left wing.

292
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,240
So we need to talk, we need to share other way of thinking.

293
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:29,400
What would you say would be a good route to implement this different form of,

294
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,960
I would say, relationality towards nature for, in this case, in my case, for example,

295
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,760
for someone like me coming from a Western background.

296
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:52,360
Because I think that it's not a possibility to simply adopt Mapuche philosophy, for example,

297
00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,520
because this is like a very different way, not only of thinking, but also

298
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:09,080
a philosophy that is enacted in a certain practice, as you already stated, rightly so.

299
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:17,480
And so for someone like me, for example, or for a constitutional convention in other countries,

300
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,440
let's say we would try to argue for a new constitution in Germany, where I come from,

301
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:33,000
and we would want to have a different form of relationality towards nature to be a part of this

302
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,360
new constitutional process and the constitution that will be brought about through this process.

303
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,760
We want a different form of relationality to nature to be inscribed into this constitution as well.

304
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:57,160
What would you say can be a framework that can be used for people that do not come from a

305
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,680
practice and from a also philosophical background that already has this different form of

306
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:15,240
relationality within it? How can we include it in processes that used to argue from a

307
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:23,880
perspective of Western philosophy, but will now have to develop into other forms of relation

308
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:31,480
towards nature as well? Do you have an idea of how to approach this task? Because it's a task

309
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,600
that is not only important for Chile, of course, it's important for the whole world, because

310
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:44,280
we can see how this very extractive logic, this logic of domination over nature,

311
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,960
how this is actually destroying the basis of our existence, and we need to find different ways to

312
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:59,880
relate it on a very foundational level. But it doesn't seem to happen somehow. Instead,

313
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:09,080
people are arguing for quick fixes without trying to really reflect upon this deeper relation.

314
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm wondering if you have an idea of how to approach it in different contexts?

315
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:30,120
Yes. It's a very important question because we need to understand ourselves from a different

316
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:42,280
point of view. There are some theories that support diversity and plurality inside democracy,

317
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:53,320
but also there are a lot of practices that recognize ourselves connected because we are

318
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,720
not isolated inside the society. We need to have a critical point of view about development

319
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:09,880
I told you, but we also need to decolonize our mind, our practice, and we need to include a

320
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:20,680
new epistemology of the humankind way of thinking, because Eurocentric or European

321
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:29,640
philosophy, instead of European philosophy connected with capitalism, connected with

322
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,040
Marxism, I'm thinking about that kind of philosophy. It doesn't solve the problem.

323
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:46,840
We, as indigenous everywhere in every country, we have been in our territory

324
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:56,600
and using our own solution. We still keep our communitarian way of life. We are fighting to

325
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,120
protect our language because inside of our language, there is a philosophy inside. There

326
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,280
are a lot of knowledge that we need, so this is part of our struggle.

327
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:18,360
LW – But inside the big discussion, the global discussion, we need to problematize the

328
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:27,880
individualism that's born from the capitalist way of thinking. Today, the neoliberal system

329
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:40,200
destroyed the connection of the people, of human with the community. We are a member of a community.

330
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:50,680
We need to support the community inside of our life. Also, the topic about connecting with

331
00:37:50,680 --> 00:38:00,120
the mother nature. We used to learn that, for instance, that the river is far from our

332
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:10,840
house, and we used to think about the water outside of us, the river outside of us,

333
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:21,560
wind outside of us. But what it is inside of our body? 75% of our body is water,

334
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:34,200
so the river is inside of us. What was the philosophy that supported the natural resource

335
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:44,520
are outside of the people? It was the capitalism system. It was the European philosophy

336
00:38:45,160 --> 00:39:01,960
that just accept the rationality of man, not women. It's no difficult to include different

337
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:09,720
practice today, because we need that different practice inside of our family, inside of our life,

338
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:19,000
inside of our community, and inside of our country. On the contrary, we are not looking for the life

339
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,680
of ourselves, the life of my family, the life of the environment, because the pollution

340
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:41,160
is contaminated our life, so our environment, and there is no possibility to have life

341
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:55,240
in our place, in our space. We need to protect life, all kinds of life, our life, insect life,

342
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:08,280
animal life, because we need the biological diversity. We need it for the future of our humanity,

343
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:22,600
and all of the country, all of the culture in the world, we have the same environmental problem.

344
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:32,440
For instance, women problems, persecution of indigenous leaders, every, all of the country

345
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:43,640
have it, the discrimination, racial discrimination. So, my, the problem that the indigenous people

346
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,880
are have today in our community,

347
00:40:52,680 --> 00:41:01,000
it's those problems you can also find it in your European, or in Europe, or in America, and everywhere.

348
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:14,760
So, but we need our, we need to pluralize our philosophy, our epistemology, and decolonize

349
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:24,120
our mind, because colonization put the one kind of way of thinking inside, like a rule for all of

350
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:35,800
the world, and that is not true. And within this process, what role does a constitution play,

351
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:46,520
or what role can it play in an ideal case? Because you have this plurality, but you also,

352
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:58,440
and that's like one possible role a constitution can play, you have the plurality within a larger

353
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:05,240
framework that is being defined through, in this case, the constitution. So, there is also

354
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:15,080
a form of, let's say, unity as well, created through the constitution itself as a certain

355
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:24,120
type of framework. So, what would you say, what's this relationship between the difference and the

356
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,200
sameness? And also, what can the role of the constitution be

357
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,680
in an ideal case? What can it do for the people? Yeah, there are different levels of solutions.

358
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:50,120
There is a communitarian solution. There are, for instance, participation of the social movement,

359
00:42:52,120 --> 00:43:01,160
or the decision of women inside the social movement is one part of the solution.

360
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:13,560
And the state is an instrument, is a structure of power. But if that structure of power

361
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,440
doesn't recognize the rights of community, the right of women, the right of indigenous,

362
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,400
the right of the nature, that structure is a colonial structure.

363
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:35,560
And by the origin, the state was a colonial structure, but it's an instrument that all of the

364
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:45,880
country has today. We can't be autonomous. For instance, indigenous people, we claim for our

365
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,320
autonomy and self-determination in order to take our own decision. But the state, the state is

366
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:05,640
but the state is there. And the state is taking decision in using without us, without us today.

367
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:14,600
So, we need to be part of that, to be part of that decision inside the state.

368
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:24,680
But using our way of thinking, that will be an interchange between culture, I think. On the

369
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:35,240
contrary, all of the decisions that states take come from just from the white and the progress

370
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:42,600
and the progress philosophy or colonial philosophy. We need to contribute it.

371
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:55,480
That is the top level as the society was the design of society. The way of society is very

372
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:03,320
hierarchical way of thinking. That's hierarchy. The state is in the top.

373
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:13,800
But if the state respects our autonomy and self-determination, we can keep our

374
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:23,320
communitarian way of life. But the state had need to recognize it. On the contrary, the law persecuted

375
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:32,200
us. That's happening in our history. We were persecuted by the law of the state. When we

376
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:43,880
create our flag, we have a very beautiful Mapuche flag we created in 1992. And the state

377
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:52,840
persecuted us because we take the decision to have our own flag. What happened? And that was

378
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,840
because the state didn't recognize that the indigenous people have the decision

379
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:08,040
to have their own flag. Because the Chilean state didn't recognize that we are a nation.

380
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,520
We are not a state. We are a nation. And one state can have a different nation inside.

381
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:29,720
We apply for that solution to one state with different nation. And their experience in Europe

382
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:39,080
they are experienced in America. The state have different nation inside and recognize

383
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:46,200
the right of those nations. So we have plural state. We have multilingualism inside the state.

384
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,640
We also have juridical pluralism inside the state in North America, for instance.

385
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:04,360
Because there are people that are looking for the solution. And we can all go to find the solution.

386
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:17,080
That is, we just need to know what is going on in different parts of the world and to be responsible.

387
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:23,400
And to be responsible. All of us, we need to be responsible about nature. All of us

388
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:34,120
need to be responsible with cultural diversity, with multilingualism. We need it, you know?

389
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:46,840
So we need to talk about decolonize our way of thinking and the pluralism

390
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:57,000
right for nature, women's rights. All of those topics belong to decolonize, help us to decolonize

391
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:08,040
our way of thinking in order to have a new society, to have equal rights inside the difference.

392
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:15,960
Great. While you were talking, I was already reflecting that the word that I used

393
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,120
on the one side having plurality and on the other unity, that actually the word unity is the wrong

394
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:28,600
one, I would say, because I encounter these kinds of discourses also, for example, in the field of

395
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:35,640
there's a form of anarchist constitutionalism, and they have to deal with similar topics,

396
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:44,200
also with questions of plural forms of jurisdictions within a larger organizational form,

397
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:51,560
so to speak. And I have to correct myself in so far as it is not really about then creating a

398
00:48:52,280 --> 00:49:04,040
meta unity. That's not the goal. It's to find a framework that works with the plurality

399
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:16,680
within it and can allow these different forms of approaches without bursting while doing so.

400
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,320
But I just wanted to note that I have to correct myself in terms of this word of unity,

401
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:31,960
because that's actually not the goal. It can have these parallel approaches without trying

402
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,800
to approach a higher level of unity, so to speak. So I just wanted to...

403
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:52,040
Yeah. One important thing to understand what I'm talking about is because I speak about the

404
00:49:52,040 --> 00:50:05,960
diversity, about plurality, and our struggle is to have a society, a plural society, plural

405
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:14,920
way of life, different languages, different cultures, because inside the plurality,

406
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:34,920
inside the diversity, there are the richness of our humanity. So to force unity in one way,

407
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:42,040
as the European did, with unity connected with the progress.

408
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,520
That means the genocide for indigenous people.

409
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,320
Well, you know,

410
00:50:51,320 --> 00:51:14,200
a very authoritarian way to think about the unity in one historical line.

411
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,800
Project develop European people

412
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:36,680
in one historical line, because they consider us, all of the Latin America,

413
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:46,760
means developed country that in the future will have the development, you know? Also international

414
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:54,680
institution speak about us like underdeveloped country.

415
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,240
They suppose that all of the policy that they did will help us for the development.

416
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,760
And what is the development? The progress.

417
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:16,200
But there was just one line of way of thinking. We were primitive, then we will be the Marxism,

418
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:24,760
said that we were first, we were primitive communism, you know, feudal society, then

419
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:32,200
feudal society, then capitalism, then the socialist, then we will have a

420
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:43,400
a common society without class. But in one line, in one progressive line,

421
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,160
in just one way of thinking, you know, and they implanted in everywhere.

422
00:52:50,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Capitalism did the same. And state, neoliberal state today are doing the same. So this is,

423
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:11,560
this is why it's a part of our struggle to incide inside the state, to pluralize the state.

424
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:18,040
But it's not all of our struggle, because we need our communitarian way. We need to

425
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:24,920
keep our language. We need to recover our philosophy. We need to use our traditional dress.

426
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:31,880
We need to, to recover traditional knowledge about how to cook food, for instance.

427
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:40,680
What society today is wasting a lot of food on poor country.

428
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,760
There are children that they don't have food. The same happened with growth.

429
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:57,880
In Chile, we have a very beautiful desert at the north part of Chile. And the

430
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:14,360
company used our desert for clothes, old clothes. That's a pollution for our desert.

431
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:27,800
So this is why we need to pluralize our way of thinking, because just one way to consider

432
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:34,040
the society and the history destroyed our humanity.

433
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,880
Yeah. And I think I'll have to add that why I initially used the word unity, which is the,

434
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:49,000
which was the wrong choice. But what I wanted to initially actually point at is that,

435
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:58,040
that's why I find this notion of a constitution so interesting. And that you were the president of

436
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:08,520
this process, actually, because the very notion of a constitution can be such a tool to organize

437
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,800
this plurality. So that's at least from the contexts that I come from. For example,

438
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:23,240
I did interviews with Daniel Leuk, who's a person who works very much in the tradition of anarchism

439
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:31,960
and also looks closely at topics of how juridismus, juridism, I would say, maybe in English,

440
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:40,680
how this can be thought in very different ways without the coercive state, without the violence

441
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:49,000
of the state and stuff like that. And there are ways to approach these questions of, let's say,

442
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:57,880
societal-wide organization and regulation of plurality in this case. There are ways to address

443
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:05,480
this. And one of them, one way or an important tool might be the tool of constitution. And that's

444
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:13,480
why I think it's such an important and interesting combination that you are so heavily involved in

445
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:21,400
these both fields, like the insistence on plurality and the struggle for a different form of

446
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:27,800
constitution, because these two things fit together quite interestingly, I think, and not

447
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:37,080
only in terms of a defense against the state, because you can also think constitutionalism

448
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,920
without state at all. And that's like the next evolvement.

449
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:54,360
Yeah, you know, Aboriginal people, we had our own constitution, and it is oral. We learned about it

450
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:02,440
by oral tradition, because one constitution is a framework that organizes one society.

451
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:14,360
And all of the society, including Indigenous, we have our rules to organize our society

452
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:22,600
and to understand life, rights, our rights, and non-human rights.

453
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:32,680
So, but the modern society that is along the world have the state, and it's a reality. The state

454
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:41,240
is one reality. We need to change. Five centuries of colonialism,

455
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:51,000
the state is one reality. We need to change. Five centuries of colonialism.

456
00:57:53,960 --> 00:58:04,280
And we had the state today making change inside of our children, for instance, by school.

457
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:19,320
Our children received the white history, not our history. White language, not our language.

458
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:31,960
Who did that? And who is doing that? The state law. This is why we need to change and modify

459
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:42,280
the inside, but it's not the last of our history, because we need to recover our spirituality.

460
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,560
We need to recover our mother's hair. We don't know the future today,

461
00:58:51,400 --> 00:59:00,200
but we are suffering because what the monoculture and monolingual state and colonial state is doing

462
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:10,200
with our people. Maybe it's a transitory state, but we are suffering because we don't know the

463
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,080
future. Maybe it's a transitory solution,

464
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:23,400
because if you put the diversity inside the law, that will change the school.

465
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:31,480
If you put the language inside the law, we will have the right to listen to the news

466
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:40,680
on television, in our language, for instance. And that will modify. When I was the first president

467
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:48,600
of the constitutional process here in Chile, I was speaking mother tongue. And there are a lot

468
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:55,800
of people that never listened to Aboriginal language. For the first time, they listened

469
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:04,120
to the news on television, by the media, by TV. And that will make an impact, a social impact.

470
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:13,400
And we need those impacts to see we are here, we are alive, because a monocultural,

471
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:21,160
a monolingual state is denying us. And maybe you have a very strong anarchist movement inside,

472
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:32,040
or indigenous movement, but we just see ourselves in that movement. But what happened with all of

473
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:39,800
the society that are thinking that we are Barbaro, that we are not, for instance, here in Chile,

474
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:50,120
they said that we are a violent people, terrorism. So we need to make

475
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:57,560
to have the possibility to share with all of the society, because we are not isolated.

476
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,480
And we need to share in the majority of the mentality.

477
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,000
And we are here, we are the 10% of the Chilean society.

478
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:17,720
And when the first referendum about the constitution, 38% give the votes for the

479
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:28,200
plurality. But what happened with the other? We need to make change inside the mentality of

480
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:35,480
the majority of the people. And how can we do that? We need the institution, because the

481
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:46,040
system, political system use the institution in order to modify the conscience of the people.

482
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:56,360
Today they are not killing directly us, as the conqueror did long time ago.

483
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:11,800
But they are killing us using the institution, church, using media, school, military forces,

484
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:22,600
cinema, using all of those institutions to support one way of thinking.

485
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:30,520
So we need to make the plurality inside all of those institutions.

486
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:37,080
Elisa, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests. And this question is,

487
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,200
if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?

488
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:49,720
Yeah, the future must be diverse.

489
01:02:52,520 --> 01:03:04,040
The future, I really appreciate the pluralism inside person. We need to be a plural person.

490
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:16,600
One language is not enough. So that is very important for the education today. We need to

491
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:24,600
recover the right for nature. Free lakes, for instance, free river, without pollution,

492
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:34,840
without pollution, without intervention. So also the women's rights,

493
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:45,880
because we are able to take our own decision. Why the man have to take the decision for us?

494
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:56,440
It's the same question in indigenous matters, because why white people have to take the decision

495
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:10,440
for us? We are not children. We are nations. So the future must be better without racism,

496
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:23,320
without colonialism. And we'll be better respecting mother earth as our mothers.

497
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:29,800
In my culture, we pray for the nature. We say thanks to the nature.

498
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:40,840
And I believe that if more people do and feel that

499
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:51,480
the mother nation will recognize us, all of us as their children or their

500
01:04:51,480 --> 01:05:03,320
sons. So with different values. Society with different values that keep the life for us

501
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:13,960
and for the diversity, cultural diversity, biological diversity, and also with the

502
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:22,440
women decision inside the world. Because we have war today.

503
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:34,200
And women, we always keep, we take care, we know how to take care of other people.

504
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:48,200
And when one president, one country does the war, they don't think about children,

505
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:55,640
they don't think about elders, they don't think about the other. Maybe a woman

506
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:04,920
can think about other, but with other values. I'm not thinking now in Margaret Thatcher,

507
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:15,320
because he had a patriarchal way of thinking. We need to stop the patriarchalism too.

508
