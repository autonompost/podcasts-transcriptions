1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and my guest today is the economist Jeffrey Sachs.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:15,280
I recorded this interview during last year's Globe Art Academy and I hesitated to release it for mainly two reasons.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,320
The first one is that this interview came about more or less spontaneously

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
and I wasn't able to prepare myself as much as I usually do.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,640
I also like spontaneous interviews, don't get me wrong, but in most cases I like to come prepared.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,360
This was one of those cases and so this was a minus on my part actually.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,240
And the second reason I didn't release the interview yet is that it's not complete.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:51,760
Mr Sachs was kind enough to lend me his time immediately before his keynote speech at the Globe Art Academy

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,720
and then time ran out and we had to stop the interview before getting to some of the more

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,880
delicate questions in my notes. And I say delicate because Mr Sachs is a many-sided person

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,680
and I would have loved to get to better understand how these different sides fit together.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,160
Just to give you an example, Mr Sachs was an advisor to Yanis Varoufakis during his time as

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,080
Greek Finance Minister and he endorsed Bernie Sanders as the Democrat presidential candidate,

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,920
which surely was a great help to the movement since Mr Sachs is an important figure in economics

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,320
and many try to frame Bernie Sanders' approach as specifically economically unreasonable,

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:41,120
which of course isn't true, but in these cases it of course helps to be endorsed by a person such as

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,160
Mr Sachs. On the other side, Mr Sachs was also at least partly responsible for what is called a

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,920
shock therapy approach and the economic liberalization of former communist countries

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,640
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This arguably has a big part in oligarchic structures

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,120
within these economies today and it would have been very interesting to ask the Jeffrey Sachs of

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,920
2019 whether or not he would have done things differently given his views on politics and

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,200
economics today. Unfortunately, we didn't get to this part, but nonetheless we covered a lot of

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,760
interesting and important ground, so thanks a lot to the Globe Art Academy for making this interview

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,120
possible and my warmest greetings to everybody at the Globe Art team. Before we get to the interview,

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,680
I wanted to welcome Simona and the person with the pseudonym Monster aus dem Loch as Patreons.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,560
Thank you so much for your support and since one of the questions during today's episode is

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,560
directed towards the possibility of different kinds of political economies, I wanted to point

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,800
you all towards episodes 31 and 32 of Future Histories with radical economist Daniel E.

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,280
Sarros as a guest. In these two episodes we take a deep dive into Daniel Sarros' book

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,720
Information Technology and Socialist Construction, which I highly recommend when

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,960
it comes to the question of how fundamentally different political economies could actually

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,040
look like. But now please enjoy today's episode with Jeffrey Sachs.

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,760
Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and my guest today is Jeffrey Sachs,

34
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
economist, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University,

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,800
special advisor to the United Nations, secretary general and one of the world's leading experts

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,880
on economic development. Welcome Mr. Sachs. Thank you, great to be with you.

37
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,160
Mr. Sachs, all too often political actions are justified by economic parameters such as the GDP,

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,280
for example, the gross domestic product. Yet these numbers do not represent the actual

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,520
well-being of humans, animals, the ecological environment or anything as such, as well as it

40
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,200
doesn't factor in the future well-being of any of these. So I'd say it's high time for different

41
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,960
parameters to measure our actions against what could those be and what to do about the things

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:29,760
that cannot be measured but are equally important. We do indeed in almost all countries follow the

43
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:38,720
indicator of gross domestic product and I happened as a young student to be a student of

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,480
then emeritus, a very senior, very wonderful professor, Simon Kuznets, who invented the gross

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:55,760
domestic product. He developed it between 1919 and the 1930s when he came up with this concept

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:04,720
and won a Nobel Prize for it. But he always used to emphasize this is not a measure of our well-being.

47
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,120
This is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a measure of the market transactions taking

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:19,120
place in an economy. It's useful to know it was originally designed to help governments plan,

49
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,040
interestingly, to help them plan for two purposes. One, for war because in a war governments need to

50
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,280
requisition resources and for war planning they need to know how big the economy is and how to

51
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,720
mobilize those resources. It also then became used starting in the 1930s for macroeconomic policies

52
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,640
to fight depressions, to fight the contractions of a business cycle. It became part of macroeconomics,

53
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:04,560
the field invented by John Maynard Keynes. It was not then and until today, not now, a measure of

54
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,720
whether the economy is serving the people, whether it is promoting well-being, whether it is

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,680
protecting or destroying the environment, whether it is promoting or taking away from longevity.

56
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,560
In other words, a tremendous amount is missed from this indicator. But crazily enough, it is

57
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:37,680
probably the most watched number in any economy by the business sector and by the broad public

58
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:46,080
in almost any place in the entire world. So that's the long answer to your question,

59
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:56,160
do we need a new measure? Absolutely. We need measures that track whether what we want out

60
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:05,120
of an economy, ability of people to meet their needs, the ability of people to live with comfort

61
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,560
and safety and dignity, the safety and sustainability of the natural environment,

62
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:21,520
the quality of our lives, the quality of our society in terms of trust, the functionality

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,680
of our governments in terms of honesty, competence or corruption. We need measures because those are

64
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:38,160
all important. And when you follow one measure to the exclusion of the other measures, you follow

65
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,720
or you pull, I should say, your economy and society right over a cliff. If you're following

66
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:55,360
a wrong goal, just maximize GDP. Of course, we're going to destroy the environment.

67
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,320
We're going to put favor of the mega wealth over the fairness of the society.

68
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,880
We're going to privilege things that are sold on markets, not things that are

69
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:17,040
non-markets such as our leisure time, our time with children, our own time for learning and so on.

70
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,400
So you follow the wrong measure, you pursue the wrong goals. It's as simple as that. And that's

71
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,920
why we need better goals and better measures for the things that are really important.

72
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,640
What could those be? Are there actually models that take all these things into account? Is there a

73
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
good way of approaching this that already has been established?

74
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:52,400
There is a worldwide movement, sometimes under the rubric beyond GDP, because it is really about

75
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:01,440
measurement other than GDP that is trying to answer your question. What should we be measuring?

76
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:13,360
There's one idea which I rather like and pursue, in fact, with colleagues, and that is to try to

77
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:22,160
measure happiness directly. How could you do that? We don't have a galvanometer to put on

78
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,520
your skin to measure how happy you are. So what is done is to ask people about their life satisfaction.

79
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,760
And then I and colleagues and now a whole worldwide industry of researchers

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,920
studies how people answer the question, are you satisfied with your life? Or on a scale from zero

81
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,520
to 10, where would you place your life from the worst to the best? The answers to that question

82
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,480
are very, very informative, even predictive of how people are going to vote, whether they support

83
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,880
populism, whether they are suffering, because an answer to that question also is often very revealing

84
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,120
of the mental illness or depression of people and so forth. One learns a lot about society from

85
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,120
looking at the changes over time in the answer to that question. In the United States, for example,

86
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,880
where that question has been asked for decades, we have seen over the last 15 years a significant

87
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:42,000
fall in the response to the measure of well-being. And it seems pretty clear that

88
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Americans, my own country, are feeling worse and worse about many things. And so that is an important

89
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:57,280
indicator. The OECD, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the club of

90
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,960
the high-income democracies, Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and a few other

91
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:17,760
countries, has been pursuing a broader range of measures that are measures about quality of

92
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,320
the environment, measures about the work-life balance, leisure time,

93
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:34,400
measures about the quality of jobs, the safety of the work environment, the job satisfaction.

94
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,800
So they have come up with actually dozens of indicators. And what the OECD

95
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:52,080
staff says is, here are your indicators. They're all online. You can put the way to aggregate them

96
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,680
according to your own values. So we won't give you the weights to add up across all those different

97
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,480
dimensions. That's something for you to do. If you think that the most important issue

98
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,760
is leisure time, or you think the most important issue is life expectancy, or you think the most

99
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,240
important issue is the environment, well, take the indicators and you make your own

100
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,320
weighting. But their idea is that we don't know how to add. So we have to use our two eyes,

101
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,600
our two hands, our toes, our fingers to look at 20 or 30 indicators rather than just one or two

102
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,000
indicators. I think that has a lot of merit also. Now, there's another way that I work on,

103
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:49,280
which is to take into account that back in 2015, all 193 governments in the United Nations

104
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:58,480
unanimously adopted the sustainable development goals. These are 17 goals that in principle,

105
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,280
at least, are shared by all countries of the world. They include ending poverty, ending hunger,

106
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:13,920
promoting health, ensuring that all children of school age are in school, gender equality,

107
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:23,200
safe water and sanitation, renewable energy access, decent jobs, good infrastructure,

108
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:32,400
low income inequality, sustainable cities, circular economy that cuts

109
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:42,000
waste, control of climate change, protection of oceans, protection of land, ecosystems,

110
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,720
the rule of law and global partnerships. Now, if you were counting carefully,

111
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,280
you would have seen that I named 17 SDGs. Those are, and I know them because it's my job at the

112
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:03,040
UN to help advise how to achieve those 17. So, another thought that I very much subscribe to,

113
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,280
because I think these goals are very important, is to examine how the 193 countries of the world

114
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,400
are faring, whether they're making progress to achieve those goals or whether they're going

115
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,480
backwards or whether they're just treading water that they're neither going forward nor backward.

116
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:34,080
So, my colleagues and I at the UN produce each year what we call the SDG index. That is a single

117
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:44,480
number or a ranking which says if you take all 17 goals and you measure how each country is

118
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,320
performing on those 17 goals with a score of zero if it's the worst and a score of 100 if it's

119
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,680
achieved the goal and then you add up across the goals, take the average, then you get a score

120
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,360
and we find that some countries, especially in Europe, Austria is doing pretty well,

121
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,320
Scandinavia is doing even better in general, are making good progress towards the SDGs

122
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,280
and some of the poorest countries are in absolute desperate shape and really need the help of the

123
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,240
rich world but typically are not getting much help because our world is not a very generous

124
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:38,080
world these days. But that SDG index is another approach to your question, how can we measure

125
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:46,320
what's really valuable in life? That SDG index, if I could summarize it, says that societies have a

126
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,040
three-part objective. They want to be prosperous, they should or they claim to want to be fair

127
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,280
and they want to be environmentally sustainable. So, a high score means that you are both

128
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:12,160
economically, socially and environmentally on the right track. My own country, the United States,

129
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,600
comes in around 35th in the world on this, a pretty dismal score for such a rich country

130
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,560
and the reason is that the US is quite rich but it is not fair and it is not environmentally

131
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,360
sustainable. So, of those three pillars of sustainable development, the economic pillar,

132
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,960
the social pillar and the environmental pillar, the US does well only on one of them, the economics,

133
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,680
very rich country, very technologically sophisticated country. But Boyer, we unfair

134
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,880
because the gap between the rich and the poor is the highest gap of any high-income country

135
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:01,120
and of course, we have a crazy president, Donald Trump, who thinks that it's his job to

136
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,560
increase the carbon emissions rather than to decrease the carbon emissions because he is

137
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,800
trying to help the coal, oil and gas industry to make more profits whereas what we know

138
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:25,840
scientifically is we have to get out of those fossil fuels and move to wind, solar, hydro,

139
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:33,280
geothermal energy. So, the US scores pretty poorly even though it's a rich country and that

140
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,680
to just add that long description is a good example of the question that you posed. Here is

141
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:51,360
a country, the US, very rich, very high GDP per person but not achieving the quality of life,

142
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,720
not achieving the protection of the environment, not achieving social justice. So, we want a measure

143
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,680
that says, aha, don't think you're so good. Your quality of life is evidently suffering and the SDG

144
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:15,760
index has that property that it flashes a warning red light to the United States you're on the wrong

145
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:25,840
track. And because you're talking about the question of fairness within the United States

146
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,600
but there's another aspect to the question of fairness which would be the international one

147
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,160
because for me at least living in a country like Austria where the social welfare net is at least

148
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,600
kind of working. I mean, it's getting worse but it's kind of working. And internationally seen,

149
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,640
it's of course pretty good. But still, at least for me, it's pretty striking that we are still

150
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:59,040
living on the backs of others. So, even Scandinavia, which might have a good ranking

151
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:06,800
within this score system, this kind of leaves out to factor in this fact that the western world is

152
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,360
actually living kind of on the backs of others and there are people dying on the borders,

153
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,880
there are like strong protectionist economic policies and stuff like that. Does that come

154
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:28,240
into play somehow? When our group, which is called the United Nations Sustainable Development

155
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:38,720
Solutions Network, makes this SDG index, we have tracked as closely as we can a large number of

156
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,760
what we call spillover effects, exactly the kind of problems that you're talking about.

157
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,480
For example, we may say we're green and environmental because we're using renewable

158
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:59,760
energy. But the products that we're buying from China or from other countries are produced with

159
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:08,320
fossil fuels. So, what we did was we shifted the production to other places and we don't count that

160
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:18,880
as part of our own effect on the environment. Or when we buy soybeans or buy meat that is coming

161
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:27,520
from Brazil and those soybeans are being produced on the fringe of the Amazon and contributing to

162
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,600
the deforestation and the forest fires that are underway, we wouldn't see that in our own

163
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:42,960
consumption but it's a very real effect. Or when we purchase a product and it has been produced with

164
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,080
bonded labor or child labor or slave labor, like the cobalt that's used in the batteries of

165
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,480
every one of our smartphones around the world coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo,

166
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:04,720
the DRC, and we know horrendous work conditions there, we don't take that into account.

167
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,680
The phone manufacturers say, well, that's not me, that's cobalt, I just buy it as an input.

168
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,840
But that is a direct effect. Now, some of the adverse effects are even starker than that.

169
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Every two or three years, we have a scandal erupt because someone leaks the data on

170
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:37,680
the Panama files or the other tax havens or New York banks are shown to have been involved in the

171
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:47,280
mega-corruption in Malaysia and so forth. And these are treated then as, oh my God,

172
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,000
how did that happen? But of course, what we really know is that the tax cheating

173
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,760
and the secrecy is the system, it's not the exception. It is the way the system works.

174
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:07,360
There are tens of trillions of dollars that in the electronic ledgers are kept in the Caribbean

175
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,960
tax havens, even when there are almost no people in those countries, because under the law, which

176
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,160
is pretty lawless, those places don't charge taxes on the mega-rich. We've just had data

177
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,640
come out in the United States in the last few days that the billionaires now are paying less

178
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:38,720
than the working class in the most recent tax year. And the billionaires use these tax havens.

179
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:48,400
Even more direct effects, of course, are when the US or Sweden or others sell armaments to

180
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,560
the Middle East that then end up killing people in Yemen or killing people in Syria or killing

181
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,400
people in Afghanistan and so forth. That is a pretty direct spillover effect that comes out of

182
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,240
the bay of a bomber. It kills a lot of people. So we try to measure those spillovers. That's

183
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
one of the reasons why the rich countries definitely are not scored as achieving

184
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:24,400
the sustainable development goals. And one of the key alleged planks, self-declared planks,

185
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,920
of the SDGs is SDG 17, partnerships of the rich and the poor countries. But I'd say in general,

186
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:39,360
the rich countries are pretty lousy partners because they do not really honestly look at what

187
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:49,520
poor countries need in order to escape from poverty or to escape from the environmental

188
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,480
crisis and so on. Of course, the poor countries need to govern themselves properly, but they have

189
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:04,240
every right, literally right, to expect that the rich countries will be acting honestly,

190
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,880
fairly, and without all of these dire spillovers. The poor countries also have the right to expect

191
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,920
financial help from the rich countries, but that also comes only in small amounts.

192
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,080
There is a category of spending called official development assistance, sometimes called foreign

193
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,600
aid. That's what governments in the rich countries give to governments in the poor countries. We're

194
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,560
not very generous about that. The total amount of so-called foreign aid or official development

195
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:45,760
assistance is about one-third of 1% of the income of the rich world. And that's a very

196
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:56,160
in the United States, it's less than half of that. Well, it's about half, about 0.16 or one-sixth

197
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:04,960
of 1% of US GDP. So we're really nasty and greedy in not providing help for the poorest people

198
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,000
in the world. Now, here the Scandinavian countries do better. They're providing about 1% of the

199
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,360
national income in development aid. Austria could do much better. It's such a rich,

200
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:25,680
beautiful country, and it wants people to stay home and not be migrants massively to this country.

201
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,800
But one way to do that is to ensure development in the poor countries so that people have a

202
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,920
future in their own countries. And that does require that the rich countries step up and

203
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,520
help to provide the health care, the education, the infrastructure that makes it possible for

204
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,560
the poorest countries to develop. So that's definitely an area where Austria could do a lot

205
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:54,800
more. And isn't it a problem that oftentimes when financial aid is given, that it is given

206
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:04,400
tied to certain obligations? Conditions. Yeah, conditions, oftentimes economic conditions of

207
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,320
privatization, opening the markets in order to let international corporations come into the country

208
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:19,680
and take over the markets. And yeah. Well, the aid is given for all sorts of reasons

209
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:29,840
of which fighting poverty is often way down on the list. One reason why aid is given is purely

210
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,280
for military or foreign policy reasons. And often those foreign policy reasons are

211
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,760
a pretty unpleasant ones. The U.S. has a lot of allies that are rather thuggish countries.

212
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:52,000
Those countries get aid because the U.S. wants those countries as allies. Maybe there's a U.S.

213
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,320
military base there, for example. There's a famous phrase about why aid is being given to

214
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:09,520
particularly horrible country. And the statement is that the leader is really a son of a bitch.

215
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,760
And the answer is, well, he's a son of a bitch, but he's at least our son of a bitch.

216
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,960
And this is a real problem with foreign aid. Too much of it is about war, the military,

217
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:31,360
or foreign policy alliances. Conditions on foreign aid that

218
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,480
are conditions that the aid should be used correctly are conditions I believe in. In other

219
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:46,480
words, if you say, I'm going to help country X to keep the children in school, then putting

220
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,800
the condition that the money we're giving, we want to see the schools and the teachers,

221
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,280
and we want verification, and we're going to audit that program, that's perfectly appropriate

222
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:02,320
in my view. Because if you give the help for a reason, it should actually be fulfilled.

223
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:13,840
If the aid is given instead, look at the crisis in the United States with our absolutely dangerous

224
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,360
president, Donald Trump, who's surely the worst president we've ever had in American history.

225
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,760
He's giving aid to Ukraine, we now know, based on the Ukrainian government agreeing to

226
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,320
investigate Donald Trump's political foes. Oh, this is straight corruption in the United States,

227
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,760
so the aid is being used for the political objectives of the president of the United States,

228
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,080
not anything about Ukraine, and not just the objectives of the president of the United States,

229
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,800
absolutely constitutionally illegal objectives. So we're rooting for impeachment, I can say,

230
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:05,920
just as a parentheses, but the point is that aid gets given for all sorts of reasons. Now,

231
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,240
but let me clear up one important point, because I've been involved in this question for a quarter

232
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,840
century, very intensively, often day to day. Once in a while, aid is given for the right reason,

233
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:28,240
to fight a disease, to help children in school, to ensure access to safe water and sanitation

234
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,080
and so on. And I just want to assure everybody that when aid is well-intentioned and professionally

235
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,440
directed, it actually works. So the most important point is that development aid

236
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,480
can really help poor people, help them to stay alive, help the children to get vaccinated,

237
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,560
help the mothers to survive childbirth, help to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and many other

238
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,440
incredibly important, wonderful things. And it can be done honestly and professionally.

239
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:12,320
So we shouldn't confuse the fact that the likes of Donald Trump or George W. Bush misuse aid

240
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,960
as a general condemnation of the concept of rich countries helping poor countries,

241
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:26,960
because rich countries have a moral obligation and a practical need to help poor countries.

242
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,400
We don't want a world of instability, of starvation, of mass force migration. And

243
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,600
when we're serious about it, which our governments are too infrequently serious,

244
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,840
but when we are serious about it, the aid can actually work.

245
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,560
One of the things that I'm arguing for in this podcast is the need for a plurality of political

246
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
economies. This brings up a couple of problems and open questions, of course. One of these

247
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,040
problems is the repression of alternatives when it comes to the political economy on a national

248
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,120
level. At least from my perspective, it seems as if the moment a movement comes into power that

249
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,280
wants to do things substantially different, and Syriza and Greece would be an example for this,

250
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,960
then there are very effective mechanisms in place that are able to prevent this from succeeding.

251
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,240
First of all, I'd like to know if you would agree with this assessment. I guess Venezuela

252
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,560
would be a second contemporary example. Allende in Chile in the 70s would be a historical third,

253
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,840
but the list goes on and on. So first of all, I'd like to know if you'd agree. And if yes,

254
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,280
could you explain to us some of the mechanisms, the toolkits that are being used in order to

255
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,800
prevent this plurality of approaches towards political economy from happening?

256
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:57,760
Well, it's a little bit complicated because if you take the case of Greece, for example,

257
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:09,680
the fact of the matter is Greece largely got itself into a mega crisis. The governments

258
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:17,120
in Greece borrowed too much in the first decade of this century, ran up big budget deficits.

259
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,080
Then the financial crisis came, and oh my God, they owed so much they couldn't repay.

260
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:36,240
So the starting point of the Greek crisis was rather bad luck combined with rather lax

261
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:46,960
economic policies. No country should expect that they can overspend what they have

262
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,160
and get away with it for a long term. If you look at Venezuela, it's not different from that,

263
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:01,280
actually. In the case of Hugo Chavez and then his successor,

264
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:11,040
they followed a rather classic left populist strategy of Latin America, which is that

265
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:22,640
Venezuela is an oil country. When oil prices were high, Chavez spent very, very amply and

266
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:32,480
and overspent, borrowed against future oil earnings. Then oil prices collapsed in the

267
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:42,000
world markets in 2014. Chavez died of cancer. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, is not so clever

268
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:52,080
and spent down the country's reserves. Basically, Venezuela went broke around 2017.

269
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:03,600
Now, in both of those cases, one could say that the alternative project wasn't so accurate.

270
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:17,200
I can tell you as a personal matter, I went to see Mr. Chavez in 2002 in Caracas. I know a thing

271
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,200
or two about the Venezuelan economy because I worked on it. I studied it. I know a lot about

272
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:35,200
oil rich economies from a lot of professional experience. I warned him, don't live only on oil.

273
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,520
Don't keep your exchange rate overvalued. Don't borrow against your future income.

274
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:48,800
I have to say either he heard the opposite of what I said each time because he didn't hear the

275
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,400
don't and he thought I said do, or of course, more realistically, he had other things in mind

276
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,880
and wasn't interested in listening to a university professor from Columbia University. But the fact

277
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,880
of the matter is the economy was badly mismanaged. Now, having said that, there are two very important

278
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:19,440
things to understand. One is that when countries get into economic crisis, really for whatever

279
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:30,960
reason, out of their own mistakes or by international bad luck or by some pressure from abroad and often

280
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:41,760
it's a mix of those, we should never tolerate mass suffering because for whatever reason a crisis

281
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:50,720
comes, mass suffering is immoral in this world and very dangerous. It leads to terrible outcomes.

282
00:35:50,800 --> 00:36:00,080
People die, children die, there's mass hunger, there's destitution, there's disarray, and in

283
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,960
Greece there was an extremely serious economic crisis. So I tried to help several Greek governments,

284
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:18,400
in fact, when George Papandreou was prime minister and then when Mr. Tsipras was prime minister,

285
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,920
so really across the political spectrum, I tried to help by saying to the Germans,

286
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,480
look, you're the creditors, but you can't just squeeze this country so brutally because the

287
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:38,720
pain that's involved is absolutely brutal. Well, they didn't listen and I think the outcomes

288
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,680
were far more serious, negative and harmful than they ever should have been. Maybe Greece is

289
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,480
starting to come out of that right now, but there still is a massive overhang of debt

290
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,280
that should have been lifted from the books years ago. In the case of Venezuela, it is worse than

291
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:05,040
that because it's not just that the world didn't come to the aid of Venezuela. When Donald Trump

292
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:14,560
came to power, because Trump is a thug, he decided that he would try to overthrow Maduro. Now, this is

293
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,560
absolutely against international law. It's against common sense. It's against basic decency

294
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:30,960
and it is a very bad habit of the United States because the US is a kind of neo-colonial power.

295
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,040
It is the world's most powerful country and it has a very bad track record of overthrowing

296
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,760
governments of other countries. I was quite aghast at this. Donald Trump even told

297
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,560
Latin American leaders, maybe we'll just invade directly. He said that in September 2017 at a

298
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,000
private dinner of a number of Latin American presidents who subsequently told me about the

299
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,240
dinner conversation. That's not just not helping. That is being a thuggish. That is being absolutely

300
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,960
reckless. Well, it got worse than that because Trump, rather than invading, decided to squeeze

301
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,200
the life out of the Venezuelan economy. They were bankrupt already but then

302
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:31,920
Donald Trump essentially said, we will block Venezuela's access to the financial markets,

303
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:40,080
starting with the oil companies, the main oil company in the middle of 2017. Then in January

304
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:49,280
2019, just this year, Trump issued an order which said, you can't do business anymore and we're

305
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:57,600
going to seize the assets of the Venezuelan government. The situation went from a self-inflicted

306
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,600
wound, which Venezuela certainly had inflicted on itself, to what is a human catastrophe

307
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:15,280
created by the United States. Hunger, a lack of access to medicines. It's an extraordinarily cruel

308
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:25,040
policy. It is a war on the civilian population, not through a military attack but through a denial

309
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:36,080
of food. Our international system is extremely weak at stopping that. Where is Europe to say to

310
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:43,600
the United States, you can't do that? Well, Europe barely has a foreign policy. It needs one. It needs

311
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,360
a backbone to say to the United States, you can't get away with such thuggery. In fact,

312
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:55,120
Europe has said, well, Maduro is a dictator, so we don't really want to stop the US pressure and

313
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:02,800
so on, but the means of pressure is absolutely immoral and illegal. To answer your question,

314
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,320
it's a bit complicated. Countries get themselves into trouble, but then I have two rules. One,

315
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:19,280
when a country and a population is in trouble, they need help, period. These are human beings

316
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:28,400
and leaving countries to suffer is a gigantic mistake, but worse than that, if you add on to

317
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:39,520
the pressure and the US has a bad habit of doing this, then it's worse than merely a lack of effort.

318
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:49,360
It's actually, in my view, a crime against the domestic population. Now, I can tell you that

319
00:40:50,240 --> 00:41:00,720
in this story, we are at the 100th anniversary of the Versailles Treaty and everyone should

320
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,320
note and remember the meaning of that. 100 years ago at the end of World War I,

321
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:21,040
France and Britain put heavy reparations on Germany at the defeated country and the victors

322
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,080
said that the defeated country would have to bear an intolerable burden. The great economist John

323
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:34,480
Maynard Keynes wrote in 1919 in one of the most important books of the 20th century called The

324
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:43,280
Economic Consequences of the Peace. It is a mistake to levy such a harsh peace on Germany because it

325
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,920
will lead to a backlash. He said within a generation, if this is done, there will be a

326
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,240
terrible price to pay. Of course, it was 14 years later that Hitler came to power,

327
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:04,800
in part because of the devastating economic conditions of Germany. We should never push

328
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,080
countries through economic policies to despair, whether it's at the end of a war,

329
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:19,440
whether it's because of even the self-inflicted wound of overborrowing, which gets a country into

330
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:28,800
a debt crisis, or because a president of the United States doesn't like the political party

331
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,880
in power in another country. All of that is extraordinarily dangerous and we should have

332
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,480
learned the lesson of the 20th century and we should not be driving countries to despair.

333
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:49,600
And if you look at what we're doing today, it's not only Venezuela, it's not only the harshness

334
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:57,920
with which Greece was treated. Iran, because of the US again, is being squeezed to the point of

335
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,960
hunger and despair through US sanctions and Europe opposes those sanctions but doesn't really fight

336
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,600
them adequately. They just say, oh, we can't really do anything. The United States, you know,

337
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,480
it's an important market and our businesses don't want to violate US sanctions. Well,

338
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,320
Europe should have a backbone and should stand up and say the US sanctions are against international

339
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,280
law, they're against common sense, they're against the Europe's security interests, they're against

340
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,160
the world's security interests, and we absolutely reject them and will not honor them.

341
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,320
I'm so terribly sorry that we have to stop this interview at this moment because I'm being signaled

342
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:51,280
that it's time to move on. I would have had so many more questions, but unfortunately,

343
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
it's no time. Well, I hope we can do it again sometime. Thanks a lot for taking the time,

344
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,400
Mr. Sachs. Great to speak with you. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
