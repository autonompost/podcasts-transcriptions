0	6320	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and my guest today is Daniel E. Sarrows,
6960	12080	with whom I will be talking about digital socialism and the abolition of capital.
12800	16560	Before we get to the interview, I'd like to say a few words on this.
17120	22640	What you are about to hear is an in-depth discussion of Daniel Sarrows' proposal of
22640	28800	a socialist political economy with its own socialist laws of motion and a socialist mode
28800	35680	of production. More than anything, this is an invitation to everybody out there longing for
35680	42400	fundamentally different political economies to please join the discussion. And if I say everybody,
42400	47680	I do mean everybody and specifically people coming from other traditions of thought and
47680	53760	political orientation. I'm really honestly interested in your opinion on that. This whole
53760	58880	thing here is meant to be an open and honest investigation of how fundamentally different
58880	64720	kinds of futures can be brought about. And I do believe that Dan's work is an important
64720	70880	contribution to this. Since he dares to do what many shy away from, he puts out a concrete
70880	77200	proposal. Such a proposal can only be seen as a starting point, of course, and I can't stress
77200	84000	this enough. This is a wholehearted invitation to engage with these ideas. I put an extra effort
84000	89360	in creating the show notes for this episode, so you'll find a lot of resources for further
89360	95920	engagement with the topic there. We will cover the proposal as well as its historical foundations
95920	102960	in great detail, so much so that I had to split the three-hour interview into two episodes.
102960	108960	The second part will be released in episode 32 of Future Histories in two weeks time.
109600	115440	Patreon supporters, however, can listen to it already starting today. So if you are super
115440	121440	fixed by what you hear today and can't stand waiting another two weeks, every support on
121440	129520	Patreon is greatly appreciated. But now please enjoy today's episode with Daniel Seros on
129520	133200	digital socialism and the abolition of capital.
139200	145840	Welcome to Future Histories. My name is Jan Gross and my guest today is Daniel E. Seros. Daniel is
145840	152000	a professor of economics at Valparaiso University and author of the book Information Technology
152000	157760	and Socialist Construction, The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism, which we will
157760	164320	discuss at length in today's episode. Welcome, Daniel. Thank you. It's great to be here. Great
164320	170000	to have you. First of all, thank you, Daniel, not only for taking the time for this interview, but
170000	175840	also for writing this book. I think it's really of vital importance that we develop very concrete
175840	184160	proposals for alternative political economies, yet many shy away from exactly that and end up in
184160	190240	vague appeals to solidarity that might be more immune to criticism, but at the same time,
190240	196240	they do not provide answers to the crucial question of how exactly an alternative to
196240	201920	the capitalist mode of production should be organized. So I was delighted to read your
201920	207680	very concrete proposal, which addresses basic questions of political economy and its mode of
207680	215920	production head on. What is it that you aimed for with your book? Well, ever since I was a graduate
215920	222480	student at the University of Notre Dame, I've been studying Marxian economics. And around 2008,
222480	228560	it became clear to me that I could not continue working in this tradition unless I answered the
228560	234640	question for myself, just how the socialist mode of production would operate. So it's really not
234640	241040	enough to criticize capitalism. One must have something concrete to offer in its place.
241760	249760	And so I began working on that question. And it became clear to me that a socialist society
249760	254480	would need to find an alternative movement that could replace the movement of capital,
254480	260800	as Marx described it in volume one of capital. So it would need to have its own logic, its own
260800	267440	dynamic that would be self-sustaining and allow for the continued development of
267440	274000	society's productive forces. So most importantly, it would need to eliminate the exploitation of
274000	277840	labor power, which is the defining feature of the capitalist mode of production.
279520	283440	So I think we need an entirely new method of economic organization.
284000	290480	We don't want to simply focus on interventions within the capitalist system, such as minimum wage
290480	297600	laws and Keynesian macroeconomic management. As much as those kinds of interventions might be
297600	305280	important in a capitalist society to achieve equity, economic stabilization, what we need
305280	311360	is a full-blown alternative that can really stand on its own. And even though it will emerge from
311360	318720	capitalist society, it's going to be something entirely different. And in order to build a
318720	325360	sketch of how this could look like, your book has four parts. First, the logic of capital,
325360	331600	second, the defense of capital, third, the renewed challenge to capital and fourth,
331600	338080	the end of capital. These are all very much relevant for the investigations of this podcast.
338080	344880	So please let's take a look at each of them. In part one, you first describe the capitalist
344880	351280	laws of motion. You then argue that while Marx did indeed provide an analysis of the capitalist
351280	358240	mode of production, he did not provide a concrete answer or idea of what socialism would actually
358240	364080	look like and how it would be organized in practical terms. First things first, what is
364080	369200	the logic of capital and what does it mean to abolish capital as such?
369200	375840	Well, I think to understand the logic of capital, you really need to read volume one of Marx's
375840	382160	capital. There's no substitute for it. It's very difficult to read the first time, especially part
382160	389600	one on commodities and money, but it's worth the effort. And so capital obeys certain rules or laws
389600	396160	of motion. And that is what I mean when I refer to its logic. So Marx describes how commodity
396160	402640	exchange within capitalist economies can be represented symbolically as CMC prime.
403280	407840	So that is commodities are sold for money and then they're used to purchase other commodities.
408560	413040	This is the sphere of circulation where Adam Smith's invisible hand operates.
413840	418880	People pursue their own self-interest and they exchange their property for the property of
418880	424160	another person. And then that leaves both sides to the exchange better off than previously.
425120	430400	At the same time, Marx identified another movement that can be easily overlooked.
431600	438880	And this movement is capital and is symbolically represented as MCM prime. So in that case,
438880	444240	money is used to buy commodities and then the commodities are sold for a larger sum of money.
445280	449920	And the difference is surplus value, the difference between the amount of money initially
449920	455600	spent and the amount that's realized at the end. That difference is surplus value.
455600	461600	So it's realization and appropriation or what motivates capitalists to set capital in motion.
463040	468240	So how is this surplus value possible? Well, Marx argued that there is a special commodity
468240	474480	that's available in the marketplace in capitalist societies. And this is the commodity labor power,
474480	481120	which is the capacity to work during a specific period of time. So it's sold as a commodity
481120	486800	in the marketplace. And it has this special property that when it's consumed, it actually
486800	493280	creates new value since human labor is the source of value. So the really amazing feature of this
493280	500960	commodity labor power is that its value depends on the values of the commodities that the worker
500960	507920	needs to live and work. But its value creating power is actually larger. So during the course
507920	514480	of a working day, a worker will create new value equivalent to what they need to live and work.
515200	520160	But then because they work during the entire working day, they create value in excess of that.
520160	527360	And that surplus value is what motivates capitalists to pursue capitalist production.
527840	532400	So the basic movement that I just described has been this driving force throughout the history of
532400	539040	global capitalism. And this accumulation of capital has really revolutionized the means
539040	546400	of production and created this world that we have today. So to come back to your question,
546400	552640	what does it mean to abolish capital? It means to bring an end to this economic category,
552640	559120	as Marx defined it. And so we want to identify an alternative movement that can positively
559840	566240	develop society's productive forces and better serve human needs. So it is possible, of course,
566240	572240	to abolish capital and destroy human civilization. But that's obviously not what most of us want.
572240	577520	And so what we want is a positive substitute for this thing that Marx called capital.
577520	585600	Well, you're right that it is important for us to, and I quote here, recognize the crucial point
585600	591840	that even if everyone on the planet adopted Marxism, socialism would not be possible unless
591840	597600	certain objective conditions were met. What these conditions are is the key question that
597600	604480	must be answered. And on this question, Marx and Engels had precious little to say. According to
604480	610560	your book, there is a silence both about these objective conditions for socialism as well as on
610560	616960	the question of how a socialist political economy would be organized in practical terms. You call
616960	625040	this the great silence. Could you maybe explain this a bit to us? Sure. I argue in the book that
625040	630320	there are really two essential conditions that must be met for socialism to be possible.
630320	634720	So the first is what I'm referring to as the acquisition of social consciousness
634720	640080	throughout the human population. So this means that we need to become conscious of the fact that
640080	645920	we are members of the human species and that we work together to achieve some sort of balance
645920	651280	between our productive activities and the natural environment. And furthermore, we must recognize
651280	657920	capitalism involves a conflict between social classes and that will never achieve this balance
657920	662880	as long as this conflict continues. So one condition then is that we become conscious
662880	668880	of these things. The problem, however, is that even if we all become committed Marxists and
668880	673920	acquired this species consciousness, it would still not be sufficient to alter the mode of
673920	680880	production, I argue, because certain objective conditions must also be met. So specifically,
680880	686480	our productive forces must be sufficient to produce an abundance of use values for consumption.
687280	692800	That is a condition that socialists, I think, have long recognized that we'd be able to produce a
692800	701120	huge abundance of use values of material wealth. Without this ability, we would enter into conflict
701120	706400	with one another over what is available. We would also not produce enough beyond what's needed to
706400	711840	satisfy our basic needs to then further develop the social forces of production. So in other words,
711840	719680	it wouldn't be anything left for investment. So more is needed then. And what we also need is to
719680	726640	be able to communicate our needs to each other in a way that is conscious and planned and then use
726640	733360	that information to efficiently allocate resources to produce what we need. So socialists have long
733360	740640	argued that the ability to produce an abundance of use values is a key requirement for socialism
740640	747600	to be established. But again, this emphasis on the communication of social needs has been given
747600	753760	less attention, I think. So I argue that Marx and Engels did not specify these conditions clearly,
754320	761440	and they argued instead that speculation about the socialist future was a utopian exercise.
762720	767200	They had really very little to say about the subject of socialism, especially in comparison
767200	772480	with how much they wrote about capitalism. And I think this silence on the question,
772480	778080	it appears as a contradiction in Marx's worldview. And this is something I bring up in the introduction
778080	784480	to the book. That is, the proletariat is supposed to consciously establish socialism,
785360	792960	and yet we cannot describe what socialism is in any detail. And there seems to be a conflict there.
792960	800720	So really, the whole book, I would say, is about trying to resolve this apparent contradiction.
801520	806880	How could Marx hold both views simultaneously that we're supposed to consciously bring about
806880	813840	socialism, but at the same time, we should not describe how it is to function in any detail?
813840	820000	That seems contradictory. So really, to resolve this contradiction,
820960	826320	I think what we need to do is recognize that Marx's vision was limited due to the insufficient
826320	832240	development of society's productive forces or its technological capability. In other words,
832240	839440	modern information technology was not available or even conceivable in Marx's time. And so I argue
839440	844480	that this modern information technology is one of the essential objective conditions that must be
844480	850640	in place for the socialist mode of production to be possible. So whereas it was once utopian
850640	856960	to describe how socialism would function, it's really no longer utopian because we possess the
856960	863040	means now to make it a reality. So I think Marx was really honest in that he didn't offer a false
863040	869360	solution, but only identified the features of what he called the lower and higher phases of communism
869360	875520	that could be only perfectly described at that moment in history. So this seems to me to be the
875520	881040	only way to really resolve this apparent contradiction in Marx's thought unless we just
881840	887840	accept the view that there is no alternative to capitalism and that Marx was simply wrong in what
887840	898480	he wrote. And isn't it a classical retreat to say, oh well, no, he didn't specify it in that much
898480	904480	detail because this would have been a kind of, I don't know, paternalistic act where you have
904480	911040	this blueprint of the future and that instead it should kind of organically evolve out of the
911040	918800	movement itself and that anything else would be some kind of authoritarian act somehow?
919520	925440	I think that's a good point. And one could maybe argue that that's another way to resolve the
925440	934720	paradox, that Marx didn't want to establish the blueprint and as you put it, in a paternalistic
934720	940640	manner, tell the working class what it should be doing. You certainly can take that position.
942000	951760	But it seems to me that that leaves the questions just so open-ended and with so much disagreement
951760	958640	about what to do. It's hard to imagine the working class ever, and maybe that's part of the problem
958640	967920	is that there needs to be unity among the workers as they pursue this. If there's such widespread
967920	973440	disagreement within the working class, how could they ever transform the mode of production
973440	980960	completely? So I think that may be a potential problem with that way of resolving the paradox.
981280	987440	One certainly could try to do it that way. I totally agree with you, actually, because
987440	997680	I also believe that it is necessary to have this imaginary of a different kind of future.
997680	1004720	And also, I think the point is quite valid that this imaginary future should not be
1005520	1014640	utopian in essence, in the sense that the basis for its realization is actually not
1014640	1022320	existent. So I like your point or your twist that you're saying, all right, we need this image
1022960	1030480	and we do have the means of production now to make it possible. That's kind of the punchline
1030480	1037920	that I got from your book and I really enjoyed it, actually. Thank you. Okay, so now let's get
1037920	1045600	to the juicy stuff. Let's get to the socialist calculation debate. You have a long chapter
1046240	1052960	on this topic and I very much enjoyed this chapter as well. Throughout the first half of the 20th
1052960	1058400	century, there has been quite an argument about the question of whether or not an autonomous
1058400	1065120	socialist mode of economic calculation is possible or not. This has been labeled the
1065120	1071840	socialist calculation debate. What were, from your perspective, the key arguments within the debate?
1071840	1078880	Who were the participants and what can we learn from it? Well, this debate took place primarily
1078880	1086400	between market socialists like Oskar Lange and H. D. Dickinson and Austrian economists such as Ludwig
1086400	1093440	von Mises and F. A. Hayek. I give much credit to Mises in the book for arguing that socialists
1093440	1099600	lack a method of economic calculation. In his view, without competitive markets, it would not
1099600	1105920	be possible to have a rational economic system. That is, without market prices, we are left
1105920	1111280	fumbling around in the dark without a rational guide for our decision-making processes.
1112080	1117280	This point was very important and I believe it is what Hayek referred to as the unseen problem
1117280	1122800	facing socialist alternatives. This fumbling in the dark, of course, opens the door to the use
1122800	1128640	of coercion or a command system which many socialists rejected at the time and even more
1128640	1136880	reject the use of command now. Mises thought it was logically impossible to solve the problem
1136880	1142720	any other way than through voluntary exchange. Hayek found it to be logically possible to solve
1142720	1147920	the problem, but the information processing requirements were so massive that it could not
1147920	1154400	be solved in a practical sense. It was also not possible to even acquire as much information as
1154400	1159440	would be needed in his view. Market socialists, on the other hand, wanted to have some form of
1159440	1163760	socially owned property while relying on the competitive market to allocate resources.
1164560	1170960	So some economists argued that the problem of market socialism could be resolved in a variety
1170960	1178160	of ways. One of the early papers by Enrico Barone described a trial and error method of solving the
1178160	1183920	problem so we could adjust prices. A central authority could adjust prices in the face of
1183920	1190400	surpluses and shortages and in that way commodity markets could be cleared. The same method could
1190400	1195440	be used to clear the money capital market. Hayek rejected this solution on the grounds that
1195440	1200640	competition could lead to more rapid price adjustments than a central planner could achieve.
1202000	1207920	H.D. Dickinson argued that an elite planning body could estimate supply and demand equations
1207920	1213120	and then solve a system of simultaneous equations to determine the optimal market clearing prices.
1214000	1220880	So I want to make a couple points here. That's kind of an overview of the debate as I understand
1220880	1226960	it. But first I want to say that I interpret the socialist calculation debate as stemming from the
1226960	1232400	same problem that Marx and Engels encountered and thus why they did not say more about the socialist
1232400	1239760	future. So that is Marx and Engels hesitated to describe the future socialist society because they
1239760	1245680	lacked the means to do so and only modern information technology allows for this socialist
1245680	1254720	calculation problem to be solved. So the debate, I argue, stemmed from the combination of Marx's
1254720	1260880	superior theory of capitalism but his inability due to historical constraints to describe how
1260880	1266800	the problem would be solved. So it's understandable then that there would have been such a lengthy
1266800	1273840	debate in the early 20th century about how to resolve this problem. And second, if socialists
1274640	1280880	have adopted Marx's theory of capital, why are they striving to achieve the ideals of perfect
1280880	1287200	competition as neoclassical economists define them? If neoclassical economists possess a flawed theory
1287200	1293200	of how capitalism functions by, for example, omitting class exploitation, then why would you
1293200	1298720	strive to achieve their efficiency results? Schubert, for example, was very critical of
1299360	1306800	market socialists for choosing this path and I agree that this is kind of an odd way to try
1306800	1312480	to solve the problem. Why would you build on a theory you disagree with in an effort to resolve
1313440	1320880	a problem with your own theory? I'd actually make a really bold claim and that listeners might
1320880	1327760	not agree with. But I would argue that both sides in that debate were interested in it because both
1327760	1333200	actually wanted to know if a solution exists. Market socialists favored Marx's theory and they
1333200	1340160	were eager to put forward a solution. Austrian economists, I would argue, also they recognized
1340160	1346160	the problem and they were interested in whether there was a solution but they were skeptical that
1346160	1351440	a solution would be found. And so even though I think Austrian economists recognized the strength
1351440	1358800	of Marx's theory but they didn't want to publicly acknowledge it, which would certainly be a
1358800	1365840	controversial claim for some, I include some references to Hayek's statements in my book
1365840	1373840	where it suggests that he at some point tried to kind of pull back from some of those views
1373840	1380720	because he didn't feel there was a resolution to these problems. So I think mainly that's what
1380720	1388160	I think we can learn from it. And just out of curiosity, I really liked it that at some point
1388160	1394560	in your book you point towards the need to look at the base of the argument and as you already
1394560	1401280	explained right now, you think that Marx did a proper analysis of the capitalist mode of production
1401280	1406400	but did not provide an alternative to the question of economic calculation and then Hayek,
1406400	1413200	on the other side, cleverly uses this omission as the base layer of his argument while at the same
1413200	1419120	time not providing a proper alternative analysis of the capitalist mode of production. But this
1419120	1424720	still leaves open the question if there has been an attempt to fill Hayek's omission and develop
1424720	1430800	an Austrian analysis of the capitalist mode of production. I don't know if anybody did this,
1430800	1440160	maybe Rothbard or anything, because if you say that they saw what Marx did right and they had
1440160	1445120	a valid point in the question of economic calculation, then they must have had the
1446160	1454560	urge to make it complete, to come up with their own idea of how to interpret the capitalist mode
1454560	1461920	of production. Yes, and I think the roots of Austrian economics go back to the late 19th
1461920	1467680	century, the work of Karl Menger, and they do possess a theory of capitalism. But I would
1467680	1473600	argue it's inferior to Marx's theory because like neoclassical economics, it avoids class conflict
1474160	1478800	and so it really has less to work with in its analysis of capitalism and that's really at the
1478800	1486400	root of its inferior nature relative to Marx's theory. However, it has much to say about
1486400	1491440	monopolistic firms and their behavior, capital theory, the theory of the business cycle.
1492400	1497440	My textbook actually, which is available online for free, includes quite a bit of this material.
1498080	1503680	It's available at principlesofpoliticaleconomy.pressbooks.com for anyone who's interested
1504320	1509760	in looking at it. So Roger Garrison, actually an Austrian economist, gave me permission to
1509760	1515200	summarize in my textbook his diagrammatic representation of Austrian macroeconomic theory
1515760	1520720	and I also include Rothbard's discussion of an Austrian measurement of the money supply.
1520720	1523840	So even though I ultimately favor Marx's theory, I do respect
1524640	1528800	theories that have been developed within other schools of thought, including the Austrian school.
1529760	1535360	That's nice because I think it had some... When I was reading your book,
1535360	1541760	I had the sense of intellectual honesty somehow. So I think it's important to engage
1541760	1548480	in the arguments of the different fashions. I don't want to say the other side because
1548480	1555840	that would be too dualistic, but I very much enjoyed that you obviously take this serious,
1556800	1563440	the argument of the Austrians. And there would be a second question relating to that.
1564080	1568480	And that is actually going into the other direction, not in the direction of how to
1569280	1577040	complete the theory by providing an autonomous interpretation of the capitalist mode of
1577040	1583200	production. But if Hayek... Because I was then looking at Wikipedia, when did he die?
1584160	1593440	He died in 1992. So he must have experienced the advent of computer technology. And if it was,
1593440	1601200	as you said, that he at some point kind of opened this loophole that there might be a way to
1602960	1608560	provide a different type of economic calculation, but that it is just not discovered yet, then he
1608560	1614880	actually must have considered computers and information technology at some point. Did he
1614880	1620480	write about it or are there some public statements about this? Yeah, you've asked an interesting
1620480	1626080	question here. And I have to confess. I mean, the truth is, I don't know for sure. I'm really not
1626080	1631040	an expert on all of Hayek's work. My interest was in the factors that influenced the debate in the
1631040	1637680	1920s and the 1930s. And I do regard it as an error to think that computer solving systems of
1637680	1643040	demand and supply equations could bring about socialism. The kind of solution that I propose
1643040	1648240	really relies on information technology, but in a very different way. And I don't think that this
1648240	1656000	use of computer technology could have been imagined in the early 1990s, much less in the 1930s.
1657760	1665040	So my suspicion is that Hayek would have thought that the problem of acquiring
1665040	1670560	so much information and processing it would still remain, even with the kind of computer
1670560	1678160	technology we have in the 21st century. But, and I guess here's coming back to my punchline,
1678720	1689360	I think that the kind of system that I have proposed is not one that any of the contributors
1689360	1695840	to this debate had in mind at all. It's completely different from what they were
1695840	1701040	talking about or even how they were imagining how computers might be used in the future.
1702000	1711200	So I think that's probably what sets my proposal apart. And yeah, but as far as whether Hayek
1711200	1718400	actually commented on that question, I really don't know. When it comes to popular positions
1719040	1723920	that defend capitalism, you pick them. For me, curious candidate, Iain Rand,
1724560	1730720	you picked her as your sparring partner. This came somewhat of a surprise to me because I knew
1730720	1736480	about her influence on the early Silicon Valley elite. And I have seen a documentary by Adam
1736480	1742720	Curtis, where her philosophy is explained as well as her influence on, for example, Alan Greenspan,
1742960	1750560	the former head of the Federal Reserve. Yet I always thought of her more as a pop cultural
1750560	1756960	phenomenon or even a sectarian, actually, to be honest, than a serious thinker. Could you
1756960	1762240	introduce our listeners to her philosophy and maybe explain a bit why you picked her in order
1762240	1769440	to make your point? That is a great question. The truth is that Rand actually challenged me the most
1769440	1775120	of any of the pro market writers that I've encountered. I was not very familiar with
1775120	1781120	Rand's work when I started this project. And I discovered that she defended capitalism in a way
1781120	1785920	that sharply deviated from the free market economists that I had been reading for years.
1786720	1793120	Rand's theory is a moral theory of capitalism. And to use morality as a starting point for
1793120	1798320	thinking about capitalism was completely new to me. Rand thought of herself as someone who
1798320	1804160	celebrates what humans are. And in her view, they are creative and capable of extraordinary feats.
1805440	1810960	And because of the nature of human beings, they possess rights, in her view. Specifically,
1810960	1817680	the individual possesses a right to life and to property. And only if these rights are protected
1817680	1824000	will an individual be able to realize who he or she is and unleash his or her creative potential.
1824880	1831440	So when governments interfere with these rights, these rights derive from nature. And so governments
1831440	1837200	then act immorally when they interfere with them. Since capitalism protects these rights,
1837200	1842240	it's a moral system, in her view. So this whole way of thinking was really new to me.
1842880	1847520	And I knew that I would need to settle for myself. What if anything was wrong with her world view?
1848400	1853040	Also, my book is ultimately about what humanity should do at this point in history.
1853520	1859520	And Marx and Rand both speak directly to that extremely broad question in a way that is openly
1859520	1866240	political. And so I wanted to take on a position that did not try to conceal its normative biases
1867120	1873440	while posing as objective and neutral. And this fight sort of seemed like an open and honest fight
1873440	1881120	between thinkers. So that's mainly why I chose to devote so much attention to her view in my book.
1883200	1891520	We've touched upon the subject of market socialism before. But since it is still a
1891520	1896720	very popular position within the socialist movement, I'd like to hear your general take
1896720	1903760	on why many still favor market socialism today. And I'm also interested in a specific question
1903760	1909280	related to that. Because in your book, you write about the historical socialist calculation debate,
1909280	1915600	and I quote here, in fact, in my opinion, the Austrians forced the debate and they received a
1915600	1923440	neoclassical answer, end quote. And you already talked about this. What I'm asking myself then is,
1923440	1929680	does this hold true for today's market socialists as well? Do they provide a neoclassical answer
1929680	1937520	as well? Or did they come up with a different rationale? Market socialism seems to possess the
1937520	1944000	best of both worlds. And I think that's a major part of the reason why so many still favor market
1944000	1950480	socialism. It offers freedom of choice of consumer goods and of occupation. It promotes efficiency
1950480	1956560	through competition. At the same time, it eliminates private ownership of the means of production. And
1956560	1963120	so it's aimed at eliminating the capitalist exploitation of labor power. So in addition,
1963200	1966800	it can also involve Keynesian demand management to lessen business cycles.
1967680	1974480	It can offer corrective taxes and subsidies to address externalities in markets. It will ensure
1975680	1980640	sufficient attention to the production of public goods. So it's a mix of characteristics that is
1980640	1985840	supposed to retain what we like about capitalism while eliminating the rest of it, the things we
1985840	1993200	don't like or that many of us don't like. It appears to many socialists to be the only answer
1993200	1997920	that really avoids command central planning on the one hand or capitalism on the other hand.
1999040	2004000	And so it's like a third way between the two extremes. So I think that's the main reason why
2004000	2014800	it's been so popular. But in terms of whether market socialists have their views evolved or
2014800	2020800	changed, I think the rationale for it is still pretty much the same since the socialist calculation
2020800	2026960	debate, except that maybe less emphasis is placed now in the neoclassical efficiency results.
2027520	2033520	Now I think emphasis is placed more on issues like equality and solidarity and democracy as
2033520	2039120	outcomes that are also achieved in addition to efficiency. But to the best of my knowledge,
2039120	2042400	I don't think the basic position has changed all that much.
2043520	2049680	And what are, from your position, the shortcomings of market socialism? What are the strongest
2049680	2058880	arguments against it then? I think market socialism might be able to achieve self-management
2058880	2065040	within enterprises, although there's no guarantee of that. It has a chance of achieving that,
2065600	2069680	as well as direct appropriation of profit by the workers within an enterprise.
2070320	2075040	I think that's probably its greatest strength. But the problem is that it does not eliminate
2075040	2080000	profit as an economic category, which is a shortcoming. So it really does not abolish
2080000	2087200	capital as an economic category. So therefore, competition between enterprises will continue,
2087200	2092240	along with the macroeconomic instability that is experienced within capitalist societies.
2092960	2099360	Needs will continue to go unmet in the system because profit is really the basic objective
2099360	2104720	of enterprises still and not the fulfillment of needs. And finally, as the Hungarian economist
2104720	2109440	Janos Kornia explained, it's likely to slip towards either market capitalism or towards
2109440	2115200	command central planning. Failure to replace capital with an alternative sort of self-sustaining
2115200	2120640	dynamic is going to cause its strength to grow to the point where market capitalism is revived
2121440	2124880	or coercion will be needed to stop its resurgence.
2126000	2132000	All right. And that's why you had to come up with a different solution, actually. So
2132000	2139360	let's get to the end of capital. First of all, let's talk about the socialist laws of motion
2139360	2145200	that you propose. I think what has become clear by now is that you argue for the abolition of
2145200	2150960	capital as such and that if we abolish the capitalist mode of production, we of course
2150960	2156800	need to propose a different mode of production with different laws of motion. In your case,
2156800	2163040	these would be socialist laws of motion in a first socialist mode of production and later on,
2163040	2167440	a communist mode of production. Let's do this step by step. First of all,
2167440	2173120	what does it mean to have socialist laws of motion in place? What are their characteristics
2173120	2180560	and their logic? By socialist laws of motion, I mean a self-sustaining mechanism that allows
2180560	2187600	individuals within a complex organic economy to pursue the fulfillment of needs while it also
2187600	2192880	guarantees them compensation for their useful labor. So if I were to summarize it in one
2192880	2198480	sentence, that's how I would put it. There's obviously a lot more to it, but it will provide
2198480	2204240	people with a set of rules and specific forms of interaction that will allow them to cooperatively
2204240	2210640	work towards needs fulfillment without the social relationships becoming exploitative.
2211360	2217920	So this mechanism has to be elaborated and understood before it is introduced. We can't
2217920	2223520	really discover its inner workings after it is brought into existence the way that we must do
2223520	2230160	with capitalism. The reason again is that the socialist mode of production must be a conscious
2230160	2235840	creation if it ever exists. It's not going to emerge on its own without anyone's conscious
2235840	2242560	direction. It's something we have to create. So we need to understand what this social mechanism
2242560	2247920	is before we actually live in such a society. That's what I argue.
2248400	2255840	And what is it that you propose? What are the general properties that a socialist mode of
2255840	2262000	production should have? I argue that the socialist mode of production must place the
2262000	2268880	self-conscious individual human being at the center. So the individual recognizes the importance of
2268880	2275200	communicating his or her needs to others and responding to the needs of others when making
2275200	2281280	decisions about production. It's a society without the capitalist exploitation of labor power.
2282080	2287760	Labor power does not exist as a commodity, and since markets give rise to labor power as a
2287760	2295040	commodity, markets do not exist. So the wealth of society does not consist of commodities,
2295040	2301200	as Marx described capitalist society in volume one of Capital, because commodities are unities
2301200	2307360	of use value and exchange value. They're both useful things, but they also have a value in the
2307360	2312800	marketplace. And since there are no markets, then things are not going to be exchange values. They
2312800	2318560	won't be considered commodities. So every product and service consumed then would only be a use
2318560	2325520	value. And so the trick is in trying to explain how society can use modern forces of production,
2325520	2331680	how society can use modern forces of production, including our very extensive division of labor
2331680	2339600	to produce use values that do not become commodities. So again, I need to make that
2339600	2344160	more concrete, which I hope to do later in this interview, but that's essentially it.
2344720	2351600	Yeah, great. I hope so too that we will get to the concrete propositions and we will for sure.
2352240	2359280	At some point in your book, you quote a neoclassical economists economics textbook by
2359280	2365360	Samuelson and Nordhaus, which says that, and I quote here, every society must have a way of
2365360	2371440	determining what commodities are produced, how these goods are made and for whom they are produced.
2373920	2379840	And that these are the quote, three fundamental questions of economic organization. So here we
2379840	2385520	have our concreteness actually. I think that's fair enough as a basic practical standard,
2385520	2390960	or at least I think it absolutely makes sense to expect these questions to be answered in a
2390960	2399920	socialist economy as well. So let's use these three fundamentals, fundamental questions
2399920	2406240	in order to go through your proposal. The first one would be how do you determine what is being
2406240	2414080	produced? I'm really glad you asked this question because these are the questions that show up in
2414080	2420320	every neoclassical economics textbook, Samuelson and Nordhaus and every other one. All students
2420320	2428480	of economics are introduced to economics in this way. How can we organize the economy to address
2428480	2432480	these questions and what are the different ways of organizing an economy to address these questions?
2433280	2439360	So it's going to be difficult for me to explain the mechanism completely without the use of tables,
2439360	2445200	but I'll do my best. I refer listeners to a paper on my selected works page that has
2445200	2450240	the details. It goes into a lot of depth about how this would work. But within the socialist
2450240	2455440	mode of production, workers councils would post use values in a general catalog or a universal
2455440	2461520	catalog of use values. And then consumers would select these use values and place them in something
2461520	2467040	called a needs profile to which they have electronic access. These use values would be
2467040	2472080	arranged in order from most desired to least desired and given rankings in descending order
2472080	2478000	as you move down the profile. You can leave empty spaces in the profile that will help one to kind
2478000	2483360	of rank some needs much more than others. Every person's need is ranked the same as every other
2483360	2490000	person's need. And this information is used to determine how much of each type of use value
2490000	2495760	a workers council will produce. And so this really answers the question of what to produce.
2495760	2501280	Information is collected from consumers as they register needs in their needs profiles.
2501280	2507200	It'll determine what's produced and the quantities produced. Then how to produce is really the next
2507200	2514080	question. And the point rankings that are assigned to the use values in the needs profiles are going
2514080	2520880	to be communicated to the workers councils that posted the use values. So each workers council
2520880	2526560	will develop its own target mix of inputs that it needs for production and the points would be used
2526560	2534000	to cooperatively allocate inputs from workers councils that supply inputs. The points then
2534000	2540480	can be used to allocate inputs according to where the need is greatest. So this method of allocating
2540480	2546160	scarce inputs provides the answer, I think, to the Austrian critique that socialists lack a method
2546160	2553120	of economic calculation. Once the inputs are received, it's also necessary to adjust membership
2553120	2559040	in the workers council to acquire the amount of labor power needed. I have a mechanism for doing
2559040	2565360	this that involves adjustments in the length of the working period, given income that's based on
2565360	2572240	experience and effort. So at least this gives you kind of a general overview of how I answer the
2572240	2579040	question of how to produce these use values. And then a special workers council will also be
2579040	2584960	established that sets resource consumption limits in each region, which ensures environmental
2584960	2591440	sustainability. I refer to this as a council of scientists. It has a very special role in the
2591440	2599440	system because natural resources are available in such huge quantities that when this process of
2599440	2605920	allocating resources reaches the natural resource base, we need to have some limits on that, some
2605920	2612960	global limits on how much we're using so that we can meet our environmental goals, which are becoming
2612960	2619360	more pressing all the time. So finally then, for whom are the use values produced? Well, workers
2619360	2625200	are paid with credits for their work. And when consumers purchase use values for which they
2625200	2630720	registered in need, they also receive a bonus in my proposal, which becomes part of their income.
2630720	2636560	And that's also in the form of credits. So the use values are primarily going to be produced with
2636560	2642320	those people in mind who registered in need. Others can purchase the use values using credits,
2643120	2647760	even if they did not register in need, but that action would negatively affect their bonus.
2648400	2655760	So again, I go into a lot of detail in my online paper and in the book about how all this works,
2655760	2665440	but those are the concrete details of the system. Okay. So I guess I will have to play the role of
2665440	2672560	a Advocatus Diabuli a bit, because if you put out a proposal like this, some questions will come up,
2673280	2679600	for example, relating to the Council of Scientists that you mentioned.
2681520	2687360	I guess there are two concerns there. One would be the question of elitism, because they have a
2687360	2693840	powerful role within your proposal. They decide upon the ultimate amount of resources that can
2693840	2700640	be used for the economy in total, which is of course great because it is a way to deal with
2700640	2707280	questions of ecological collapse. So this is a plus actually, but still it's a very powerful
2707280	2716000	position and people do have different ideas towards this question. So I think this will be
2716000	2722480	a kind of a battleground, of course. And I think the second question that relates to the first one
2722480	2730640	as well is that maybe it's because of the name. It kind of suggests as if there was such a thing
2730640	2739600	as one objective truth or even one science, but that's of course not the case. There are
2739600	2748080	many different sciences. There are different approaches towards the same field of a specific
2748160	2753360	science. It doesn't mean that there are just many, many different fields for science, but
2753360	2761200	that there are different approaches towards what science actually is and that there is no such
2761200	2768720	thing as one objective truth. So I guess my question would be, is there, how do you deal
2768720	2777280	with this? Is there maybe a bit more, I don't know, more grayish approach and less black and
2777280	2784480	whitish approach to this question of a council of scientists? This is a great question and
2786320	2792400	I guess I want to emphasize that this council of scientists has a very limited role to play.
2792960	2799680	It's really only to identify the quantities of these resources in each region that can be
2800480	2808720	sustainably extracted and employed in production. The role pretty much ends there and certainly
2809760	2815600	I have not specified how the decisions within the council would be made.
2817280	2823760	One can certainly imagine trying to establish rules based on
2824720	2832000	consensus decision making or majority rule. I haven't come to any firm conclusions about that
2832000	2839520	on my own. Certainly these scientists would need to defend their positions. They would need to
2840160	2847840	produce reports defending their claim that we cannot exceed these resource consumption limits
2848560	2855360	and if we do, this is the likely impact. So there would be checks, there would be scrutiny,
2856080	2862160	and there wouldn't be much incentive for these scientists to misrepresent their views. There
2862160	2870240	may be disagreement about how far we can go, but I'm not quite sure how else we, the alternative
2870240	2876800	is to allow capital accumulation to continue, allow private owners of the means of production
2876800	2883200	to make these decisions, which I think is a far worse outcome for the planet than if we have
2883200	2888880	scientists who are thinking about environmental sustainability making these decisions. And we can
2888880	2895360	also have regional councils so that it isn't all being decided at the global level. That might be
2895360	2904640	another way to kind of create less centralized power within that council. Or maybe like competing
2904640	2910800	councils. If you have three councils that each have maybe also different approaches,
2910800	2916480	scientific approaches towards looking at the question and then later on is democratically
2916480	2922560	decided upon which path we want to choose. I think at many points within your book,
2922560	2929520	I was thinking, okay, you have this general body that is described with great detail and then there
2929520	2936880	are some peripheries that somebody else will have to look into a bit more and then work out
2936880	2943280	in greater detail because it's actually not possible to have it all. And maybe not a good
2943280	2949440	way to approach it. If everything is written down in the greatest detail, every aspect,
2949440	2960560	it's not possible, I think. I think we still have to do some work in order to create this image
2961280	2970240	within our listeners' minds to get an idea of how this society and how my individual life would
2970240	2976560	look like. Because I mean, we talked about this general catalog, I can register my needs,
2976560	2981120	I will have to go to work. That's an important point. I think that you made, I will have to go
2981120	2989120	to work. But how much I will have to work will depend upon how tedious, actually how popular
2989120	2995040	the work is that I'm doing. So if the work is really very popular, then I will have to work
2995040	3000000	a bit longer than the person who is doing the shitty work that nobody wants to do.
3000000	3007200	We already talked about that everybody will be organized in workers council. That is actually
3007200	3015200	the name for the socialist enterprise. I think in the book, you also mentioned subcommittees
3015200	3021280	for different works within the workers council, employment subcommittees and stuff like that.
3022000	3029280	I think one important point that we will have to mention is the legal right of guardianship,
3030080	3038400	that would be an interesting point that you maybe can explain a bit more. And I think another one
3038400	3048400	would be the question of price formation, because that was a very important point. I think who decides
3048400	3058800	upon how much a given use value actually costs. So maybe let's start with the legal right of guardianship
3058800	3062560	within the workers council. What is that legal right of guardianship?
3063600	3071680	Well, within the Marxian tradition, a mode of production also gives or has an associated
3071680	3078960	superstructure, which includes all of the cultural and legal and religious and political
3078960	3086320	aspects of society. So I felt the need to in defining the socialist mode of production
3086320	3094800	to explain at least to this some of the elements of the superstructure that would go with it. And
3094800	3101680	so one of these is the legal relationship between the workers and the means of production.
3102560	3108560	In capitalist societies, it's the right of private property that is the dominant form of property.
3109120	3116480	Means of production are privately owned. So I felt the need to specify a type of ownership
3116480	3122640	for the socialist mode of production. And it's based on collective or communal ownership,
3122640	3130480	but that doesn't mean that everyone just simply owns every factory. Instead, it's the workers
3130480	3136720	councils, the workers who are members of that workers council who work at a particular workplace
3137360	3142640	are considered guardians. And this is the legal form of ownership in the socialist mode of
3142640	3147840	production, as I've defined it. So each member of a workers council is also a guardian. They
3148480	3155040	are charged with using those means of production in the direction of the fulfillment of social needs
3155680	3161360	and in making sure that those means of production are used properly and for that end.
3162320	3168400	As I understood it, it's a bit like a cooperative, but without being the owner of the means of
3168400	3173600	production, actually. So you have these responsibilities, you have rights assigned to
3173600	3180400	it, but it's just not a ownership of means of productions, no?
3181280	3186880	Yes, that's right. Because if the workers, for example, couldn't decide, hey, we want to sell
3186960	3191600	our means of production to a private owner, that's not an option.
3193280	3197600	But there's still, and I think that's very important for our listeners as well,
3197600	3205600	there is still personal property, no? So apart from the ownership of means of productions,
3205600	3212720	if you buy something from the general catalog, it will still be yours.
3212720	3221680	Yes, that's correct. And I think for me, that was one of the important discoveries that made me
3221680	3230960	understand what socialism means. Many people, I think, have a fear that even personal possessions
3230960	3237280	wouldn't be privately controlled or owned anymore. And so I think this distinction between private
3237280	3241920	ownership or private property and personal property is very important. When you purchase
3241920	3247600	a use value, it becomes yours. Your relationship to that is a private relationship. You're going
3247600	3253920	to consume that privately, and therefore, that kind of property right should be different from
3253920	3260320	the right of private ownership of the means of production. Because private
3260320	3267200	ownership of the means of production is really what creates these class conflicts. When someone
3267200	3273600	owns them, then they're in a position where they can appropriate the surplus labor of other people.
3273600	3278000	And that's what's giving rise to these problems, these huge systemic problems.
3279760	3288880	I think another huge problem is the profit motive as such. And you have a kind of clever move, I
3288880	3297760	think, to eliminate this as well. And that is that you detach the question how much people are being
3297760	3306560	paid within the workers council. You detach this from the question of how much is being produced.
3306560	3313280	So this kind of tries to escape this destructive logic actually of for-profit orientation. Maybe
3313280	3318000	could you explain this a bit more? Because I think this is a really crucial point actually.
3319360	3326080	Sure. The way I describe it is that workers would be paid according to a formula,
3326080	3331840	basically. There would be a base income when they first enter a profession, and then their
3331840	3337760	income would grow as they remain in that line of work and become more experienced at it.
3338800	3344800	So workers councils don't have control of that part of work income. But what they do have control
3344800	3350160	of is effort ratings. So within a workers council, there would be an effort rating subcommittee
3350160	3359840	where workers would evaluate the performance of their co-workers. So within some limits that I
3359840	3367520	think would be global limits, a workers council could assign a percentage increase, let's say,
3368240	3376160	annually for performing one's work well, or it could be lower, so within some limits.
3376720	3382240	So incomes then are being determined in this way, and that's completely separate from
3382960	3390480	enterprise revenues. There is no sense in which workers councils, socialist enterprises would be
3390480	3399200	selling use values and receiving revenues, and then some of those revenues are used for expenses
3399200	3404640	and then for profit. Those categories don't exist in this kind of society. People's incomes are
3404640	3410480	entirely being driven by work and by the bonus income from registering their needs, and so it
3410480	3416720	abolishes profit. And it has to, because if this is going to be a society that abolishes capital,
3416720	3419040	you can't have profit as an economic category.
3420720	3427440	And how is price being determined? I already touched upon it before, but this is a crucial
3427440	3432000	question for many and I like the way you approached it. How is it being done?
3433680	3439760	When workers perform work and they receive income, I say that they receive it in the form of credits
3440320	3446480	and also the bonus income from registering needs and purchasing the use values for which
3446480	3454000	one registered in need that's paid in credits to. These credits are used to purchase the use values
3455040	3461280	and when the use values are being priced, they're being priced entirely to
3462640	3472320	sell the total amount during that purchase period. So the goal is to just clear the market
3472320	3477920	essentially and also to pursue the steady and complete sale of the use values. So the workers
3477920	3484960	council might raise the prices if the use values are being sold very quickly. If they're not being
3484960	3492400	sold quickly, it can reduce the prices of the use values. If they look like they won't be all sold
3492400	3498720	by the end of the purchase period, then they could be even reduced to zero. So some use values may
3498720	3504080	be given away freely. It helps to resolve one of the contradictions I think that we see in capitalist
3504080	3510720	societies where you'd have a depression, people in need and then you'd have goods on shelves that
3510720	3517040	can't be sold. It eliminates that because now workers councils would see that and they would
3517040	3523600	have no incentive. They're not making profit from the sale of these use values so they can just
3523600	3528880	put the prices down to zero and people who need these use values can acquire them.
3529680	3535440	And the reason why they didn't overproduce in the first place is that their production was
3536240	3542240	oriented towards the communicated needs from the consumers, no?
3542800	3547200	Yes, that's right. Actually, I think that's a great point and that would help to cut down
3547200	3553440	on the problem of overproduction as well. The fact that planning is being done in such a careful way
3553440	3559520	at the individual level. I think we didn't say that because that's an important information for
3559520	3566160	the listener as well. If you register your needs within the general catalog, you shouldn't register
3566880	3572160	like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of needs that you actually do not need because if you do
3572160	3579520	so, then you won't be getting the bonuses because how much bonus you get is oriented towards the
3579520	3585120	medium of how much needs were registered by everybody, no? Something like that.
3585120	3592480	Yes, and actually in the paper that I have on my Selected Works page, I include some different
3592480	3599200	parts of this bonus and one part is a conservation bonus. So a person who actually includes fewer
3599200	3606400	needs in their profile will receive a bonus for that. So there's flexibility in the system.
3606400	3610160	The way I've set it up, maybe people would decide to do it differently,
3610160	3616080	but I'm at least proposing some ways in which to tackle certain problems and one is by creating
3616080	3621760	an incentive for people to limit how many needs they register. They're putting less strain on
3621760	3630000	society's resources and so they deserve a bonus for that. So that's another element.
3630560	3639840	How is the superstructure being decided upon? Because for me, the question of how to approach
3639840	3646480	these bonus schemes and how people are being disciplined through penalties and such,
3648320	3655120	it's something I intuitively tend to reject, I have to say. I think it's because of the implicit
3655680	3664000	image of humans that is kind of evoked there. I think I get the point that you're making
3664000	3671360	because you're kind of trying to not be utopian but realistic somehow. It's not a communist society
3671360	3679840	yet, but a socialist one, people will have to go to work and they will not be 100% altruistic
3680800	3688320	all the time. Of course, one will still have these capitalist logics internalized as well.
3689120	3695520	Of course, there are limits to our resources. I kind of read the whole thing as saying,
3696160	3702480	come on, people, let's be honest here. We need some kind of rules. We need some kind of mechanism
3702480	3712080	to organize our behavior towards a behavior that is better for all of us. But still,
3714080	3721040	something within me is struggling with this approach of market design and mechanism design.
3721040	3727520	Somehow, I feel that. I think we will get there within the interview, but first, how would this
3727520	3734800	be decided upon in the superstructure, as I said, the schemes of bonuses and stuff like that?
3736160	3746240	Yes, that is a great question. I think it would need to be decided through open and democratic
3746240	3754560	debate. During this transition period, there would be the need for a socialist state or a
3754560	3760080	proletarian state to actually implement all this. There would be democratically elected
3760080	3767200	representatives who would work out these details. I think the important point is that everyone,
3767200	3776400	every single person, would be subject to the same incentives. Whatever ends up being decided,
3776400	3782000	everyone will be affected in the same way. I think that is very important. The bonus for
3782640	3789200	registering your need and then actually making the purchase. The bonus for leaving items out
3789200	3794720	of your needs profile if there is a penalty for purchasing use values for which you did not
3794720	3801360	register a need. As long as all of those incentives are the same throughout the population,
3802240	3808000	I think it will avoid becoming the kind of authoritarian solution that we might fear.
3808000	3816240	Okay, so let's try to tackle the underlying question of freedom and the individual there,
3816240	3825120	because I think even though I kind of stumble over some of these market design elements and
3825120	3833120	incentive logics, I get your point. I think, I hope, but there will be people out there who
3833120	3841360	will be saying, oh, come on, that's the next Stalin coming up and stuff like that. The question
3841360	3849680	of freedom and the question of the individual is a crucial one, I think, if you want to bring in as
3849680	3857440	many people as possible. Let's try to kind of work out your position on whether or not this is a
3858240	3866800	free society or not. So which conception of freedom is emphasized within your proposal
3866800	3873760	and to which conception of the individual does it relate? The individual is free to communicate
3873760	3879760	one's needs and to know that those needs have an equal impact on the use of global resources.
3880480	3886880	So that's a new kind of freedom, I think, that doesn't currently exist in our society and one
3886880	3895360	that people will appreciate. They don't recognize that we could even have such a freedom. So I think
3895360	3901520	that's something I want to emphasize. Also, the individual is free to receive compensation for
3901520	3908880	work that contributes to the social product. So labor that is performed in serving human needs,
3909600	3915840	there is a right to compensation for that. But there are freedoms that are lost, I will
3915840	3920560	acknowledge. I mean, the freedom to acquire income at the expense of other people, that goes away.
3922880	3924000	That's a sad loss.
3926880	3931440	All right. So some of what is considered liberty in capitalist societies goes away.
3931440	3936960	People will not own businesses. They won't hire workers and then live off the profits. Now,
3936960	3942720	for some, that will be a major loss, especially small business owners who are also workers
3942720	3948960	in those businesses. They will feel that as a tremendous loss. I think that we have to recognize
3948960	3953520	that there will be some tradeoffs if we move to something radically different. And it seems like
3954480	3962720	we're in some ways being forced to pursue these different alternatives. In addition, people will
3962720	3968960	not own shares of stock and collect dividends as distributions of profit that have been produced
3968960	3975280	by workers. That will go away, that kind of stock ownership, because compensation will be based on
3975280	3980400	work as a member of a worker's council. It won't be based on ownership of means of production,
3980400	3986240	which is essentially what stock ownership represents. And finally, the individual will
3986880	3992000	live and work in a manner that forms a harmonious connection to other human beings and to the
3992000	3996640	natural world. That's really what we're kind of striving for with this sort of society,
3997600	4003680	that kind of harmony that defenders of capitalism say applies to capitalism, a kind of social
4003680	4010320	harmony. But critics of capitalism have always denied that. And so this is aimed at trying to
4010320	4015040	create that sort of harmonious connection. So there will be freedoms that are gained
4015680	4021280	in the new society, self-management in the workplace, workers who currently have no power
4021280	4026400	and no say in what happens will have a voice. But there will be freedoms that are lost.
4026480	4030160	And so I think we need to be honest about that as well.
4032160	4039200	So, I mean, obviously, if you have a general catalogue and you have this administrative body
4039200	4049440	that is administering this general catalogue, the question of privacy immediately pops up.
4049440	4055520	There's only credit, so this means everything is registered, no? And would there still be
4056080	4060960	some way to purchase stuff anonymously?
4063200	4069120	That's a good question. I think anonymous purchases of use values will be possible.
4069760	4075840	All purchases really can be anonymous, but the information will enter the system. So there's
4075840	4081680	a difference there. And are you concerned about the information being communicated to the system
4081680	4083520	or it being made public?
4084320	4090160	Well, I don't think that it will be made public because that would be a definite privacy breach.
4090160	4098640	But I think there's the concern of misuse. That's one side. And then there's a subjective feeling
4098640	4105120	of being surveilled or not. Right now, if I want to purchase something that I
4105760	4113600	want, for whatever reason, if I'm sick and I don't want my employer to know
4114800	4120960	whatever, this and that, and I can purchase the medicine anonymously and nobody will ever know,
4120960	4128960	or there are other things that people just don't want to communicate via consumption
4128960	4136080	to whatever system, I guess. So there are both sides to that, at least, I guess.
4139840	4145920	If this became a widespread way of organizing economic activity, if this became the dominant
4145920	4151440	mode of production, then opportunities to make purchases in the way you're describing
4151440	4158000	would diminish greatly. And so that may be something that we would lose.
4158560	4164800	However, I do think that in this system where people's incomes are not derived from
4165360	4173840	profit or ownership of capital, that there would be much less reason for someone to try to
4174800	4182400	use the information or even care about the information. If you want to make a specific
4182400	4188480	purchase, there isn't someone who's going to want to really aggressively market to you.
4189360	4195120	And so I think the potential for abuse would be greatly diminished as well.
4197680	4202400	I'm not sure about that. I think there will still be a danger there. There are different kinds of
4202480	4211760	misuse as well, but maybe one should consult the cryptography folks there and try to find some
4211760	4218960	technological rerouting because there are things like, I think it's called zero knowledge proofs
4218960	4225840	and stuff like that. So where it is possible to communicate a certain type of information,
4225840	4231200	but still sealing another type of information that is kind of bound to it.
4231200	4239200	So maybe there are some technological workarounds for providing privacy, but still
4239200	4247680	implementing a system like that. I think that would be an open question to me, that privacy
4247680	4255440	concern, I think. I think those are good ideas. Yeah. Let's talk to the crypto folks.
4255440	4268320	I guess. Another question is that of coercion. So if somebody does not want to work in your
4268320	4277440	proposed scheme of things, they say, oh, come on, you socialist guy. I don't support your system.
4277440	4281920	I don't want to work in that kind of society. I have my small business. I laughed at it and
4281920	4293280	you took it away. I'm angry. Yeah, I'm glad you brought that scenario up. I'm not suggesting that
4293280	4301120	there would be that kind of coercive intervention where the state would take someone's business. In
4301120	4306560	fact, I want to avoid that kind of coercive intervention as much as possible in this kind
4306560	4312800	of transition. If a person owned their own business and were the only worker in that business,
4313440	4321600	then nothing would change for them. If they employ other workers, then the one
4321600	4328800	coercive element in this whole thing, if you want to use the word coercion, it would occur in the
4328800	4338800	transition because at some point the workers at a workplace would need to establish their right of
4338800	4344080	guardianship. And so they would need to seize the property. They would need to take control of the
4344080	4351200	property. That's where it happens. It could happen in a small business if there were enough workers
4351200	4357040	who wanted to run it themselves. But yeah, it couldn't happen in a business where there was
4357040	4363680	just one person because they already control those means of production. But also, workers don't need
4363680	4368400	to participate in this revolution either. They can choose to work for privately owned capitalist
4368400	4374000	firms and continue to buy and sell commodities. Their ability to do that is going to decline as
4374000	4379520	more workers participate in the transition to a new mode of production. So it's really just this
4380240	4383760	coercive element only comes in when the workers take possession of the means of production
4384320	4386720	and workers establish this right of guardianship.
4387680	4393040	Okay, that's interesting. So you're already kind of pointing towards the question of transition.
4393040	4396880	We will get there. But first, I'm very interested in the point that you were raising.
4397680	4406640	How small can a workers council actually be? Is it okay if it's just two people, but both of them
4406640	4412960	have equal rights within this workers council? So they have what today would be called a small
4412960	4422480	business, but it's a small cooperative slash workers council. Would that be possible?
4424160	4429920	Yes, I think it could be. Now, the system can involve some limits on this. So
4430720	4438720	let's suppose that a very small workers council is formed and posts to use values. And then
4438720	4445200	consumers start to include those use values in their needs profiles. Points then would be
4445200	4449360	communicated to that small council and the council could use the points to get inputs
4449360	4457280	to produce those use values. One could, I think, say that since those workers are receiving income
4457280	4464560	for that work, we might not want the points to fall below a certain level in order for them to
4464560	4472560	qualify as a workers council to earn that income. So maybe as a minimum number of points per worker
4472560	4477920	that has to be achieved before you can even have this happen. Otherwise, there'd be abuse, right?
4477920	4482800	I mean, you could have workers who are just really not doing anything or are only receiving a few
4482800	4488080	points and doing very little work and getting a full year's income every year, and we wouldn't
4488080	4493840	want that. So we would have to have, again, probably some global limits on what the minimum
4493840	4500800	number of points would be per workers council so that we're ensuring that actually there is
4500800	4507920	useful work being done towards fulfillment of needs. And that actually touches on upon
4507920	4518160	another aspect that is kind of interesting. It is possible for workers councils to post new ideas
4518160	4524240	into the catalog. So I think that's a really important point to make because it's not about
4524240	4530640	a centralized authority that comes up with, oh, we need 100 of this and 100 of that. But it's
4531200	4540240	the information and also the ability for innovation is placed within the workers council. So they can
4540240	4546320	post a new use value in the catalog, and then people can scroll through the catalog. And if
4546320	4552960	they like it, they will eventually put it on their needs profile. And then it will, if it's
4552960	4560400	not just one person, but you know, as you said, some amount is involved, then it will be produced.
4560400	4569280	And I really like that about your proposal. Another question that relates to the overall
4569280	4575280	topic of freedom and individuality that we're talking about right now is the question of
4575280	4583440	unconditional universal basic income, actually, because that is something that does not exist in
4583440	4589760	your proposal, actually, but it is something that is getting quite some traction right now.
4589760	4597600	And many people are in favor of because it kind of it seems to provide a different kind of freedom,
4597600	4603680	you know, and I actually I like that about the idea of unconditional basic income as well,
4603760	4610480	that I get the sense of, okay, I do not have to think about my existential needs anymore.
4610480	4620000	These are covered. And from this, I get a very, you know, energizing prospect of okay, now I can
4620000	4632320	really put my my energy to use wherever I think it might fit the best. And, and but you're kind of
4632800	4637200	proposing something different, you have a base income, but it's not unconditional, you have to
4637200	4642720	you will have to work for that. Why did you decide against the unconditional basic income?
4643680	4650400	Yeah, it's a great question. I think the aim of this new mode of production is to ensure that
4650400	4655600	people receive compensation for their useful work, and not that they receive compensation,
4655600	4661680	regardless of what they do. So the idea behind a universal basic income, I think it's an
4662160	4667840	ethical principle that's not really consistent with my understanding of socialism, which,
4668400	4675200	which many might find surprising. But I think it's and I even think it's inconsistent with
4675200	4681040	Marxism, actually, because I think Marx's description of the lower phase of communism
4682320	4687360	was consistent, even though he didn't put it quite in these terms, with the principle from
4687360	4693760	each according to one's ability to each according to one's work. And so within the socialist phase,
4694640	4700160	keeping the incentives there to continue working and producing is important. I think when you move
4700160	4705920	to the higher phase of communism, what Marx Marx described as higher phase of communism described
4705920	4710800	as from each according to one's ability to each according to one's need, then you move closer to
4710800	4719200	something like that, where all you need to do is register your needs in order to have access to
4719200	4724960	the things you need. Although, although even there, because you have to contribute as you're able,
4724960	4730320	you do need to engage in some kind of productive work. But this can be broadly defined. And I think
4730320	4736960	you know, care work is one possibility, a person need not go to a traditional workplace away from
4736960	4742400	the home in order to do this. You know, even though I appreciate the idea behind a universal
4742400	4748640	basic income, I think in trying to stick to those ethical principles that I understand,
4749200	4755760	that relate to socialism, communism, it didn't seem to fit. And that's why I didn't don't have that
4756480	4757600	as part of the proposal.
4757600	4761920	This has been the first of two episodes on the topic of digital socialism and the abolition of
4761920	4768880	capital with my guest, Daniel E. Saros. I hope you enjoyed it. Please let me know what you think
4768880	4773840	about the topic and write me if you know about interesting thinkers or practitioners for that
4773840	4780720	matter, that might bring in important contributions to the discussion. This is an ongoing engagement,
4780720	4787440	matter that might bring in important contributions to the discussion. This is an ongoing engagement.
4787440	4792240	So there will be more episodes that explore different aspects of what I'd like to call
4792880	4800160	the socialist calculation debate 2.0. You can write me via future underscore histories at
4800160	4806400	protonmail.com. And you can be a part of the discussion on Twitter or on the future histories
4806400	4810720	subreddit. So long, have a good time. Hear you in two weeks.
