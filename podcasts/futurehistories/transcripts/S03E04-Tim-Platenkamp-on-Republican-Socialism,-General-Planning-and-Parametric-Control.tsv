0	8000	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome Tim Plattenkamp in today's episode.
8000	14000	Tim is a political theorist interested in democratic planning and republican thought.
14000	22000	He has written a forthcoming book titled The Constitution of Socialism, which will be the topic of our conversation today.
22000	29000	Before we start I would like to welcome Christina and Samuel as patrons of Future Histories.
29000	32000	Thank you so much for your support, it's highly appreciated.
32000	38000	And I would like to thank Lukas, Karl and Sascha for their kind donations.
38000	48000	And now please enjoy today's episode with Tim Plattenkamp on Republican Socialism, general planning and parametric control.
53000	55000	Welcome Tim.
55000	58000	Thank you so much. Thanks for the invitation.
58000	68000	So Tim, in your work you engage deeply with the planning debate as well as with republican thought in order to develop a feasible republican socialism.
68000	72000	Could you give us an overview of what you aim to achieve with your book?
72000	87000	Yeah, the primary aim was to basically formulate a realistic achievable socialism, so socialism achievable by actually existing people.
87000	89000	That's the bottom line.
89000	92000	And there's a little bit of a secondary element to it.
92000	101000	I wanted socialism also to be a little bit identifiable and recognizable to different strands of socialism.
101000	115000	So the entire, the primary aim was basically to formulate an achievable socialism that could materialize by the actions of actually existing people.
115000	117000	So that's the bottom line.
117000	129000	And in addition, there are secondary elements like I wanted the vision socialism to be identifiable and recognizable by different strands of socialism.
129000	143000	So, yeah, so it has to have a little bit in common with different elements of socialism so that maybe the more Leninist types could identify with it and maybe also people interested in democratic socialism.
143000	155000	So there's a little bit of, I don't want to say marketing, but a little bit of thinking about how you can make it a little bit more attractive to, I suppose, socialist activists.
155000	157000	So there's two elements to it.
157000	164000	The main thing obviously being that I wanted it to be achievable within a single generation.
164000	183000	I think this is my estimation, is that if socialists, maybe of different varieties, would come to power, would gain a majority, then I don't think many socialists know what they would have to do to achieve socialism.
183000	187000	This obviously has to do with the lack of debate in general.
187000	191000	There's obviously different visions, but these are quite niche.
191000	194000	So I wanted to basically tap into that.
194000	202000	So before we get to the specifics of your proposal, let's maybe set the scene by distilling some historical lessons.
202000	219000	You emphasize that there is a huge residuum of practical experiences and theoretical reflections as well about different forms of actually existing socialisms that one should engage with and learn from when thinking about socialist construction.
219000	227000	What are, in your opinion, the lessons one can learn from these historical experiments and the theoretical discourse surrounding them?
227000	229000	You know, the lessons are numerous.
229000	233000	I think I won't mention all of them.
233000	242000	There's, I think, a plethora of lessons to be learned, which I didn't initially see originally years ago.
242000	247000	I used to subscribe to this idea that was state socialism, right?
247000	257000	So how, as a socialist, would you learn anything from Soviet-style socialism when it's basically just capitalism rebranded?
257000	262000	So there was this growing awareness that, in fact, you could learn a lot from it.
262000	267000	I don't know what kickstarted this awareness, but it just grew over the years.
267000	295000	And some of the lessons I think that we can learn are, have to deal with the difficulty of setting prices, even of calculation in Natura, which the Soviet authorities used in their material balances, the enormous difficulty of processing enormous volumes of data, and the problem of obtaining reliable data in the first place.
295000	299000	So first you have to gather it and then digest it.
299000	310000	All of these are huge problems that a future socialism will have to deal with and that economists in these socialist countries try to deal with.
310000	321000	So for me, it was enormously illuminating to read their works and basically engage with their thoughts, because it's in that sense, it's very relevant to us as well.
321000	334000	Yeah, and we'll get to some of the insights that you distill from the theoretical engagement later on as well, namely when it comes to what is called Kosrachet.
334000	338000	I didn't know this word before, but we'll get to this one later.
338000	343000	I'm just curious, I mean, do you have a certain kind of focus?
343000	354000	So you engage a lot with what can be called a reform period within the Soviet Union, you engage with experiences from Yugoslavia as well.
354000	370000	But I mean, one could have added other historical examples in order to kind of enlarge the set of different modes of government, so to speak, the pool from which to kind of distill insights.
370000	387000	And I mean, some of the experiences that come to mind are anarchist practice or maybe commoning as well, which is a real life example for a different way of approaching these types of organizational questions.
387000	400000	This kind of seemed very much on purpose on your part that you focus on these experiments, but I was just wondering whether or not you kind of engaged with these other thoughts and experiments as well.
400000	404000	And if you think that there might be something to gain from them as well.
404000	425000	Well, the purpose behind looking mainly at Soviet style socialism and Yugoslavia, the main appeal for me has to do with them being stretching over a longer period of time and being more expensive, because a lot of problems that emerge are unintended consequences.
425000	430000	And these tend to show up at a little bit of a later point in time.
430000	436000	So if you look at the anarchist collectives, you do see cracks in the way they approached it.
436000	441000	And I have taken note of these experiments with anarchism.
441000	450000	But if you really want to evaluate them and draw the best possible lessons, I prefer to look at the larger, longer experience.
450000	456000	That's the short answer. And obviously we can learn from the anarchist collectives.
456000	475000	I think I mentioned it very briefly as an aside that the decentralization in the anarchist collectives, I'm talking about the Spanish Civil War, the anarchist collectives there led to inequality according to the resource endowments of different collectives.
475000	486000	And where this tendency was checked, it was done by a central authority of sorts, a committee of one type or another.
486000	495000	And this was the way that they checked sort of this capitalist syndicalism, as some critics would call it.
495000	501000	So we can look at these experiments and we can try to obtain lessons from them.
501000	514000	It's just my preference for the scope of this book was to foremost to check out the lessons that we could gauge from Soviet style socialism and Yugoslav marital socialism.
514000	526000	I'm kind of a little bit tempted to follow up and getting a little bit deeper into what the specific lessons from Yugoslav experiments and Soviet experiments were.
526000	531000	It might be interesting to have a little bit of a look at Yugoslavia because it was so different.
531000	542000	And one of the more interesting things I found was that the market socialism wasn't just free markets and they actually made an attempt at a sort of bottom up planning.
542000	553000	And before investigating more deeply the subject of Yugoslav market socialism, I wasn't aware of the experiment.
553000	562000	So I think maybe we can have a little detour into Yugoslav market socialism and the main lesson I think we can learn from that.
562000	571000	Great. Let's do it. So that's very interesting because bottom up planning, of course, is something that is very much relevant for the debate today as well, no?
571000	586000	Yeah. So if I can just give a brief outline of the broad attempt that they made basically had to do with breaking up firms into smaller associations to empower the workers.
586000	594000	So this was in the 1970s. They already practiced a form of worker self-management, as most people, at least most socialists would know,
595000	601000	but they noticed a tendency of power to creep into the hands of managers.
601000	610000	So the communist leadership decided we're going to break up these firms into smaller associations to empower the workers.
610000	623000	And we are going to expect them to formulate agreements amongst each other that have to be approved by local government committees.
623000	630000	So you see some elements of the current debate in democratic planning literature.
630000	641000	There's some common elements and a number of problems that arose during this experiment, one being excessive decentralization.
641000	654000	But for me, the more interesting thing was the lack of responsibility by, and this is a theme that comes up a lot in my book, that I stress a lot.
654000	661000	So one of the reasons that I thought maybe it's good to do a short detour to Yugoslav market socialism.
661000	668000	But basically, because these agreements have to have the stamp of approval from government authorities,
668000	675000	the workers didn't feel that they owed responsibility of the ultimate outcome.
675000	682000	And this led to a wasteful use of resources and general economic decline.
682000	691000	So for me, there was a huge lesson in there about the need to have a clear division of responsibilities.
691000	699000	And this is integrated into my outline, into my model, if you would like, if you will,
699000	708000	which I take inspiration from cybernetics about the need to have parametric control.
708000	713000	And this should ensure a clear division of responsibilities.
713000	720000	So for me, that was a huge lesson that you could learn from Yugoslav market socialism.
720000	727000	Could you explain a little bit more why there was this tendency to avoid responsibility?
727000	733000	Because you mentioned that you perceived it as a form of excessive decentralization.
733000	742000	And this would, in first thought, point in the opposite direction, where you would say, OK, if there is excessive decentralization,
742000	748000	then this would mean that there is more responsibility given to the decentralized actors,
748000	755000	to the kind of autonomous or at least semi-autonomous enterprises, socialist enterprises, so to speak.
755000	758000	So this would kind of point in the opposite direction.
758000	766000	So more in the direction of, OK, there is no way to act as if the center kind of dictated everything.
766000	769000	And therefore, I'm not responsible for the outcome.
770000	782000	Well, one of the effects of this decentralization reform was basically that a firm that you might consider some body was separated into individual parts.
782000	788000	So it led basically to arms and legs working against each other.
788000	795000	So a little bit more concretely, that might mean that one branch of this firm,
795000	800000	which is now basically an autonomous self-governing entity,
800000	807000	would be afraid that the benefits of their activity would be accrued by the other branch.
807000	814000	So it would stimulate sort of prefers like competition and a lack of cooperation,
814000	820000	whereas the intention behind the reform was exactly to promote cooperation
820000	829000	by ensuring that all these associations would enter into an agreement, a social pact,
829000	834000	and negotiate how best to achieve their common goals.
834000	848000	And instead, it led to a sort of particularism where each branch or each association would pursue their narrow interests at the expense of the larger interest.
848000	855000	Yeah, this I understand. But still, I do not really understand the connection to the question of responsibility there,
855000	864000	because the way that you described it right now, one could then say, OK, if you do your thing and do not coordinate with the others, then, of course, you are responsible.
864000	872000	So this does not really solve the responsibility question, even though I can see how this kind of bottom-up planning,
872000	881000	where everybody is acting on his or her own premise and doesn't coordinate is, of course, not what they were going for, I think.
881000	892000	Yeah. Well, the question of responsibility has more to do with the agreements having to be approved by some government authority.
892000	899000	So that caused the agreements to be influenced by the preferences of policymakers.
899000	912000	And when the outcome of these agreements, once implemented, would not be beneficial or perhaps lead to some losses in profitability,
912000	921000	the workers that are part of this agreement would protest and say, well, we have to make these changes.
921000	925000	Why don't you share as government in the responsibility?
925000	935000	And so it led to a sort of strategic game where any loss incurred would be the external responsibility of the government.
935000	941000	And the government didn't want to take responsibility because they're not a commercial business, basically.
941000	950000	So there's this strategic game of interest, which ultimately led to a decline of the entire economy.
950000	954000	OK. Maybe let's get to your proposal then.
954000	965000	So could you give us an overview of the institutional setup and the key elements and underlying organizational principles that make your Republican socialism work?
965000	972000	Maybe let's start with a political setup and then we later on move on to the planning mechanism,
972000	981000	while also being conscious of the fact that you very much emphasize that this is a kind of symbiotic interlocking, you say,
981000	985000	a symbiotic interlocking between the economic and the political sphere,
985000	992000	which I really liked to read because all too often within the planning debate,
992000	999000	some models kind of completely ignore the political sphere and simply provide some form of economic mechanism.
999000	1005000	And that's it. So I really enjoyed that you push for this symbiotic interlocking.
1005000	1010000	And yeah, so this was really an interesting way to approach it, I think.
1010000	1015000	So maybe you could give us an idea of your approach because it's very much,
1015000	1023000	I think, centered around Republicanism and not everybody might know the content of Republicanism.
1023000	1029000	So maybe you could guide us through this political imagination that you sketch.
1029000	1037000	Yeah, sure. Republicanism isn't a coherent political ideology.
1037000	1049000	Republican thought has a sort of family resemblance based around a number of key values, key political values.
1049000	1058000	So that might be mixed government, freedom from domination, civic virtue, self-government.
1058000	1065000	And so it's quite malleable and not necessarily a coherent ideology.
1065000	1070000	And my reasoning for using Republicanism, civic Republicanism,
1070000	1078000	came from basically a thought experiment in what if we extend democracy all the way through,
1078000	1082000	which is the words of Chomsky in relation to anarchism.
1082000	1088000	What if we extend democracy in all scope and in every direction?
1089000	1097000	And as I try to work that through, I felt it wasn't really compelling.
1097000	1102000	I felt it would lead to a number of problems that I identified in the book,
1102000	1108000	some of which include that it would place too much of a demand on citizens to participate,
1108000	1117000	to be aware of all the policymaking, to monitor it and to deal with all these intricate details of policy.
1117000	1123000	And at the same time, this being organized by means of local assemblies,
1123000	1129000	which would therefore lead to a local outlook of the participants,
1129000	1139000	which is further reinforced by having the elected delegates from these local assemblies being tied to a mandate.
1139000	1143000	So they formulate their local views within a local context,
1143000	1149000	and then they bind their delegates to that local viewpoint.
1149000	1155000	So these are just some of the problems that emerged when we tried to basically extend democracy all the way through.
1155000	1165000	And as I was being exposed to Republican thought, particularly the idea of balanced government and constitution,
1165000	1172000	I found appeal in trying to not just extend democracy, but balance it.
1172000	1182000	So we can balance different democratic procedures in such a way that we decrease the demands placed on citizens,
1182000	1187000	and we can sort of avoid localism as well.
1187000	1192000	And that's the basic approach.
1192000	1200000	And my proposal is that this can be achieved by having bicameral legislatures.
1200000	1205000	So we retain some sort of local assembly.
1205000	1214000	The delegates are elected from these assemblies, are sent to one chamber in the higher legislative assembly,
1214000	1226000	and then the other half or so of the bicameral legislature is chosen by lot or certification.
1226000	1231000	And the delegates are under a flexible mandate.
1231000	1235000	So there's an element of representation as well.
1235000	1246000	And this has the benefit of the local viewpoints being transformed at higher levels rather than just transmitting the local viewpoint.
1246000	1252000	The idea of having people chosen by lot, delegates chosen by lot,
1252000	1265000	has to benefit that they will be a cross-section of the entire population of the region that they represent rather than local representatives with a local outlook.
1265000	1272000	And further, all this is done within a constitutional Republican system.
1272000	1274000	It's not a stateless society.
1274000	1281000	It uses a Republican form of government, including a constitutional framework.
1281000	1290000	So in very brief, that is the political outline of this Republican socialist model.
1290000	1305000	Maybe just to add for the listeners, when you spoke of the approach brought forward by Chomsky or the way that you outlined what you kind of termed extending democracy all the way through,
1305000	1310000	I think what you're talking about is a form of council democracy,
1310000	1324000	in which you have a form of pyramid scheme, so to speak, where you have different levels and each level kind of delegates the next person to a higher up level,
1324000	1330000	just maybe for the listeners as a context. That's what you kind of dissect within the book as well, no?
1330000	1331000	Exactly. Yeah.
1331000	1345000	Yeah, the idea that power flows from the bottom and you're organizing local assemblies and these local assemblies elect a deputy or delegates to higher levels instead of power flowing or downward.
1345000	1352000	That's the idea of basically libertarian socialism. It has some common ground with broader socialist thought.
1352000	1360000	That's basically the idea that I'm arguing against and that I contrast Republican socialism with.
1360000	1373000	And also another thing I might add, because I thought it was a nice feature of the Republican socialism that you described, is that the Constitution is not set into stone,
1373000	1382000	because that's something I was always wondering that if you have a constitution and like upcoming generations are born into this system,
1382000	1389000	they would have a kind of prefixed system in which they would have to interact.
1389000	1401000	And so you kind of introduce a temporal layer to this by saying that in every generation you would have to at least once debate and deliberate over the Constitution as well.
1401000	1409000	So I think maybe every 25 years, the whole society is saying, all right, how did it work out so far?
1409000	1413000	Do we like the Constitution or not? And maybe let's change something.
1413000	1430000	Exactly. So one of the reasons that I prefer constitutionalism and in that sense the rule of law is that the codes of conduct are transparent and in principle universal.
1430000	1435000	So that sort of checks the tendency towards a majority win.
1435000	1438000	So that's another element why I prefer Republicanism.
1438000	1451000	And then once you make that step, you have the risk, I suppose, of a Constitution that binds multiple generations to a single document.
1451000	1466000	And for that reason, I prefer it to see, and it's not a new idea, the Constitution as a living body and generation as being their own sovereign over their constitutional order.
1466000	1486000	But I elected to approach that by having each generation basically revisit the Constitution and allowing room for contemplative reflection on what sort of constitutional rights and duties do we want to live by.
1486000	1495000	And yeah, so it doesn't become sort of a mindless repetition of rights and duties. That's the basic idea.
1495000	1512000	And just because I'm curious, since I'm maybe a little bit more cautious when it comes to the role of the state, and I'm also interested in different approaches towards what you call the rule of law.
1512000	1523000	I'm just curious whether or not you ever came into contact with something like a law without force. In Germany, it would be a Recht ohne Gewalt.
1523000	1530000	Daniel Leuk is working on that. And since he's in Amsterdam, you might know his work. I'm not sure.
1530000	1541000	So I'm just curious whether or not you're engaged with these kind of different traditions, so to speak, that still engage with things that are very much important to you as well.
1541000	1546000	But from a very different angle. So there's anarchist constitutionalism, for example.
1546000	1570000	And there is, as I said, an approach towards law that tries to avoid the inherent violence within law and tries to kind of frame it, not frame it, but approach it from a different perspective in which it is not already a given that this violence is somehow justified or an inherent feature of law as such.
1570000	1580000	Well, my exposure to anarchist principles of law is basically mainly through Tom Holtermann, a Dutch scholar.
1580000	1588000	So I sort of engaged with him a little bit, but I'm not familiar with this principle of law without violence.
1588000	1593000	I haven't engaged with that particular variety of anarchist law.
1593000	1605000	Still, after considering the merits, I personally come to the conclusion that the Republican system is less vulnerable to arbitrary decision making and violence.
1605000	1614000	So that's where I end up in my argumentation and my engagement with anarchism is through Tom Holtermann.
1614000	1622000	Yeah, so he's an exponent also of libertarian constitutionalism, as he calls it, and voluntary law.
1622000	1629000	So there might be some overlap, but I'm not familiar with your particular principle of law without violence.
1629000	1635000	It's not mine. It's Daniel Leuchts, but this sounds interesting. I have to check out Tom Holtermann for sure.
1635000	1642000	OK, so I mean, I do have some questions relating to this setup as well,
1642000	1653000	but I think we can engage with them after we go through the planning mechanism because it kind of overlaps and touches upon questions of the subject and stuff like that.
1653000	1659000	So maybe let's take a deep dive first into the planning mechanism that you propose.
1659000	1672000	Could you outline the institutional framework and the core mechanisms and organizing principles you propose in what you call general planning and parametric control or short GPPC?
1672000	1682000	And maybe let's have an outline of the basic setup first and then we'll go through the different steps of what an actual planning process might look like.
1682000	1688000	So what are the different institutions and layers of planning in GPPC?
1688000	1700000	Yeah, so general planning and parametric control, by lack of a better term, to be honest, I struggled a little bit with a useful way to reference it.
1700000	1702000	This is what I came up with.
1702000	1717000	Well, I mean, I think it kind of worked because I had to think of David Leipman's multi-level iterative democratic coordination, which is kind of also a similar way to approach the naming question.
1717000	1740000	Yeah. But anyway, in terms of substance and not the name, there is a central planning board, which is authorized by the main legislative assembly and it determines the share of investment and therefore the share of consumption.
1740000	1752000	The division between how much do we accumulate and how much do we consume immediately and is responsible for setting prices according to the cost of production.
1752000	1761000	It has the responsibility of determining the relative price levels of different items, different resources, different assets.
1761000	1766000	It's not the responsibility of the markets or of producers.
1766000	1776000	Producers do determine cost but not prices, basically, and it's responsible for setting parameters to which producers respond.
1776000	1785000	So that includes and extends to the price levels themselves, which are parameters and production norms, basically.
1785000	1794000	So it might be norm of productivity, which sets benchmarks to compare and evaluate performance.
1794000	1799000	So that's the main responsibility of the central planners.
1799000	1814000	And to help the central planners, there's some intermediary bodies like planning offices that might be responsible for controls and audits or taking on some of the local and regional responsibilities of the central planners.
1814000	1830000	And, of course, production units themselves. So that would be mostly cooperatives and basically work collectives that produce output and use inputs and whose activities are shaped by the central norms.
1830000	1835000	That's the brief outline of this model.
1835000	1843000	OK, so how does the central planning board come about? Who's making the decisions there and why?
1843000	1852000	So this is the central planning board is ultimately authorized by the highest legislative assembly.
1852000	1868000	And so it's accountable to the main legislature and it's staffed by economists and specialists because it deals with highly technical tasks and functions.
1868000	1875000	So these decisions are mandated by the political authorities.
1875000	1884000	So it will give instructions to set the sharing investment, to set the parameters.
1884000	1894000	And these are further influenced by the social priorities that are formulated politically by this main legislature.
1894000	1907000	So if they decide that we are going to transition from one energy source to another, then the central planners have to take that into account when they set prices, for example.
1907000	1911000	So that is roughly the way that it would work.
1911000	1928000	And since prices seem to have a very important function within your proposal, how do the prices that the central planning board basically offering as parametric control?
1928000	1931000	How do these prices come about?
1931000	1938000	Well, I'm a little agnostic on the issue of where they come from exactly.
1938000	1952000	For instance, if we go by Marxist orthodoxy, then they would be set ultimately according to the cost of the reproduction of labor and I suppose the productivity of labor as well.
1952000	1963000	To be honest, I didn't really want to delve deeply into that subject matter because of the time constraints in dealing with this book itself.
1963000	1969000	To me, the priority was to give an outline of a feasible socialism.
1969000	1991000	And the determining of prices to me is feasible, even if it depends on whether we price according to the cost of labor or perhaps if we have some other idea of where prices come from, if that makes sense.
1991000	2000000	I don't know, to be honest, because I mean, that's kind of the central one of the central questions at stake.
2000000	2018000	I would say the question of how do prices come about, because that's basically what an important function of what markets provide is that they do provide a form of evaluation and valuation through the market.
2018000	2021000	And the medium of prices.
2021000	2031000	And so if we want to overcome markets, of course, the question of how prices are being formed is a very crucial one, I would say.
2031000	2041000	And I'm always curious whether or not people do think that there is a form of what might be called naturalized price.
2041000	2057000	Because I think that's kind of one of the fallbacks for many socialists is that they act as if there was a completely objective way of determining what then might be called a natural price.
2057000	2074000	I think that might tend towards this direction where they act as if accounting in labor time would be able to provide a naturalized objective price.
2074000	2087000	I'm always curious how people position themselves when it comes to this question, since it's kind of a central mechanism within any of these proposals and models, so to speak.
2087000	2095000	So that's why I'm kind of trying to push a little bit further when it comes to this aspect of the whole thing.
2095000	2115000	Well, in broad strokes, there are some considerations that the entire consumption cannot exceed the output of society, that we have to take into account the subsistence level of consumers.
2115000	2123000	Prices have to be set in relation to these factors, as well as the natural availability of resources.
2123000	2131000	But as I say, I'm a little bit agnostic about how marxistically we can approach the issue.
2131000	2141000	So I elected to not get bogged down into that discussion and leave that for some other time or some other place.
2141000	2152000	For the purpose of this book, I was satisfied with it saying we need to look at the cost of production and the relative cost and then anchor prices to those costs.
2152000	2164000	And maybe then let's get into the question of unit of account, which is, of course, related to that, because now we're talking about prices.
2164000	2171000	But I mean, the listener might imagine prices in fiat money if we talk about prices.
2171000	2174000	So that's not the way that it goes within your proposal.
2174000	2188000	So if you talk about prices, you talk about something entirely different, or at least maybe some might argue it's not entirely different, but you talk about different forms of units of accounts, so to speak.
2188000	2195000	Yeah. So in this model, there is basically an artificial point system.
2195000	2204000	So it's not currency that is being transferred from producer to producer or certainly not from consumer to producer.
2204000	2221000	The purpose of these points is to calculate the cost of certain assets or inputs, the relative scarcity, perhaps, and the benefits to households or consumers.
2221000	2237000	So let's say when a consumer decides to use their consumption points to acquire a certain item, the points are not transferred to the producer, which then uses it to acquire inputs.
2237000	2257000	Instead, the consumption is recorded as a score which tracks the performance of this producer in relation to their performance index, which includes how productive they are, whether they have an excess of supply or too much demand.
2257000	2263000	And it helps to keep track of those success indicators.
2263000	2270000	It's not the case that these points are then transferred and used as money to purchase inputs.
2270000	2283000	So that's the nuance and difference in pricing on this sort of model and regular prices as we know them today.
2283000	2296000	So I don't know how the prices come about within the central planning board, but they should kind of reflect the relative scarcity and the cost of production.
2296000	2313000	The central planning board announces these prices, which are, I think, prices not, of course, for an end product, but for intermediate goods, for production factors, factors of production.
2313000	2322000	They are announced in production points to the different socialist enterprises.
2322000	2342000	And what happens then? They then kind of bid against each other on how much they are willing to pay in terms of production prices for a given intermediate good, or is it the other way around?
2342000	2354000	I think it's the other way around, isn't it? It's that they say how much they can produce given a fixed price of a final product that they aim to produce, right?
2354000	2365000	Yeah, yeah. So initially the prices are given or announced, and then they formulate a plan and say, look, this is how productive we can use this asset.
2365000	2372000	And if it's more productive than some other alternative use, they will acquire them first.
2372000	2385000	And in the process of bidding, you might get adjustments based on those relative scarcities because the level of demand might call for an incremental increase in price.
2385000	2399000	So that's roughly how they would use their score, their rating, how well they performed and how well they say they're going to perform to acquire inputs.
2400000	2407000	OK, this I think we would have to explain to the audience because we didn't really get into this.
2407000	2428000	So there is a what you call score, which should express a certain type of efficiency within a given enterprise in terms of how effectively they are able to use the resources in order to produce a certain outcome.
2428000	2431000	So how does this come about, this score?
2431000	2447000	Well, yeah, if we take a small step back, then we have all these economic units, all these producers in the economy, and they formulate a plan in response to certain production norms.
2447000	2465000	These norms are set by the central planners, basically, and the important norms include the norm of net output so that you want to produce more stuff using fewer resources.
2465000	2473000	Ideally, this norm sets the benchmark for a sector, so it establishes a baseline of productivity.
2473000	2486000	It should be achievable, so the producers come up with a plan, and if it's a very ambitious plan, then it should at least be achievable.
2486000	2493000	So if by the end of the year it hasn't been achieved, they don't receive a good score, basically.
2493000	2504000	This is basically the Leibman reward function, which I've lifted from Leibman's multi-level iterative democratic coordination model.
2504000	2520000	And in it, there's a symmetrical penalty for over-fulfillment and under-fulfillment, because even over-fulfillment can be enormously disruptive if we end up with lots more stuff that we have to store and transport.
2520000	2527000	Unlike in Soviet socialism, if you over-fulfill, you receive a negative score, basically.
2527000	2545000	So according to such norms, the different enterprises, if you like, receive a rating that forms the basis also of their bonuses and possibly is tied to how much resources they can acquire.
2545000	2551000	Could you explain this last bit? So in which way is it tied to how much resources they can acquire?
2551000	2565000	So if they have a plan that is more productive compared to some other alternative use, then they get basically first priority, and they are able to acquire resources that others might not.
2565000	2575000	Some other enterprise that is inefficient might be discontinued entirely if they can't make productive use of their assets.
2575000	2578000	But this goes across sectors.
2578000	2596000	So this form of comparison in terms of how efficiently one was able to use resources should be a comparison that can be made between very different sectors and very different types of products that people are producing.
2596000	2601000	So it applies to identical products within a certain sector.
2601000	2614000	And the investment fund, the share of investment is channeled to different sectors where it's being allocated and distributed among different producers.
2614000	2620000	So there has to be an element of comparability as well.
2620000	2634000	Yeah, I mean, we're now kind of knee deep in technical questions, but I would still kind of try to push you a bit more on this one, because this would mean that actually the whole thing is kind of based on an idea of perfect competition, no?
2634000	2659000	So you would have to have a form of ideal competitive scenario in which socialist enterprises that are all producing the same product within a context that is the same, like the same machinery and the same amount of labor and stuff like that,
2659000	2676000	that you would have to have such an imagined ideal state of, I would say, maybe a bit provocative, perfect competition in order to then kind of derive what you call an average of productivity, so to speak,
2676000	2685000	which would then be able to serve as an evaluation mechanism against which the performance of a given enterprise can be measured.
2685000	2697000	So this, I think, is not very much a real life scenario, I would say, because the enterprises do have very different setups.
2697000	2701000	They have kind of different contexts in which they operate.
2701000	2709000	There might be a lot of reasons why a given enterprise might not be able to achieve the average compared to another one.
2709000	2729000	So I think it's not realistic to kind of derive the measurement, the value of measurement against which my performance is measured from this idea of an average, because you do not really have this perfect average to measure against, I would say.
2729000	2741000	Well, you don't obviously have producers with purely identical output, but you do have producers, at least some producers have the same types of output.
2741000	2751000	And you could, in that sense, make comparisons and even have sort of relative ranking over time.
2751000	2765000	So that is similar to, I suppose, what Kolesky proposed in relation to profit, so the change of profit over time and the change in the relative ranking over time of a certain enterprise.
2765000	2786000	So that then deals with the different contexts which producers find themselves in, meaning that if they have a technologically inferior workplace, then it's possible to track perhaps their relative position in these rankings of their sector.
2786000	2798000	So if they improve, that means that they have been more beneficial to society compared to where places that have improved less or even lowered in ranking.
2798000	2820000	But this is self-reported, isn't it? So the whole thing is based on the idea that there is not a hardcore mechanism of surveillance in place, but that the level of ambitious internal planning is defined by the enterprise itself.
2820000	2828000	That's something I really find curious about David Leibman's, what he actually calls collective morale function.
2828000	2837000	And I think the morale aspect of it that you kind of ditched in your phrasing of it is quite important for David, I think.
2837000	2852000	And I think there's the crux, so to speak, because the enterprises themselves define what is for themselves an ambitious goal, so to speak.
2852000	2863000	And if you do not want to kind of surveil whether or not they are providing this ambitiousness truthfully, so to speak, you would have to have a different kind of indicator.
2863000	2879000	That's why you introduced the averages, I think, no? And so if you have instead of the averages, a kind of comparison over time, then you would then fall back to the problem or quote unquote problem that this is self-reported.
2879000	2893000	So I can then kind of start with a very easily achievable ambitiousness and then make it easy for me to achieve the reported goals, isn't it?
2893000	2904000	Yeah, I suppose that because you inherent your position from the previous period that that effect is limited, though that is, I suppose, speculation.
2904000	2913000	It is self-reported. Obviously, the achievement itself is being tracked by a logistical control system.
2913000	2925000	And the reason I say relative ranking is because that if you have a relative ranking, it is different, I suppose, than if you have simply an absolute improvement or not.
2926000	2935000	Just to give you some background, I wrote a book chapter because I'm co-editing a book with Christoph Zorc on democratic planning.
2935000	2942000	And so I wrote a book chapter and in the book chapter, I also take a look at David Ledman's collective morale function.
2942000	2946000	That's why I kind of push further on that front, you know?
2946000	2947000	Yeah.
2947000	2964000	I think for the audience in order to get a bit more of a macro perspective on the whole thing, it would be important to sketch out what you describe as the three public sectors, because I think that's very relevant for the whole picture.
2964000	2972000	So you have these sectors which are called the collective sector, the administrative sector and the cooperative sector.
2972000	2984000	And each of them have different functions and they are also kind of organized in different ways and along different types of organizational principles.
2984000	2990000	So maybe you could kind of sketch what these sectors are and how they are being approached.
2990000	3000000	Yeah, so the names are only loosely connected to the industries that fall under this umbrella.
3000000	3007000	The collective sector includes basically public utility and infrastructure.
3007000	3015000	So there might be energy and things that are considered natural monopolies.
3015000	3029000	These have to be managed differently compared to, let's say, a cooperative bakery because it deals with a natural monopoly that has to be run directly for the benefit of society.
3029000	3053000	So that means that if we place it under the care of a workers council, they might sort of enrich themselves at the expense of society by producing less output or basically increasing the cost of maintaining their operations without also increasing the benefit to society.
3053000	3071000	So as a result, I propose that this should be managed as a sort of co-determination scheme where there is a workers council, but it's not the primary decision maker and there's more direct public accountability.
3071000	3081000	The same principle applies to the administrative sector, which includes public education and administrative overhead, so civil service as well.
3081000	3096000	And the key difference is that for the public utilities, there might be some nominal fees involved, whereas primarily in the administrative sector, services are free at the point of use.
3096000	3108000	The third sector, the cooperative sector, is basically where production is geared for individual household consumption, and that might be the easiest way to explain it.
3108000	3127000	And there the prices are connected to the cost of production and producers are supposed to recoup these costs on behalf of society, so they're not free at the point of use, and it involves basically individual household consumption.
3127000	3148000	And those are basically three sectors, and within the cooperative sector, the workers councils are primary decision makers, so they have direct influence over the course of their activities and within the parameters of the central planners basically.
3148000	3162000	And I was, to be honest, a little bit shocked to see that their care sector is missing, so there's no mentioning of the care sector in total, so to speak. So how would this be approached?
3162000	3183000	Well, the care sector would fall under the umbrella of administrative sector, so care branch falls under the administrative sector. Administrative meaning has more to do with the way it's being governed, I suppose, and the type of services that fall under it.
3183000	3188000	So different care, child care, health care is included in the administrative sector.
3188000	3213000	All right, so we will get to the question of remuneration later on, but that means that if the care sector is a part of what you call the administrative sector, and if you have schemes of remuneration in actually the whole model as a basic form of how you set up the question of
3213000	3232000	labor and maybe even subsistence. So if there is some form of remuneration within the cooperative sector, then of course the question arises if people are being remunerated for care work, which would take place in the administrative sector.
3232000	3258000	Yeah, there's remuneration in all sectors. There's no fundamental difference between sectors in that respect, so care work would be remunerated. I don't deal with it directly, but I would prefer that to a large extent it would be collective, so that even extends to child care, child rearing, being for a large part not exclusively collective and remunerated.
3258000	3274000	Now we have this setup of the three public sectors. There are different forms of how these sectors are being approached. So this gives us a total picture, so to speak, of the, let's say, resource throughput as well.
3274000	3294000	And then, of course, since we are all aware of environmental questions and problems that are imminent, would there be a cap in terms of total energy throughput or resource throughput, and how would this be kind of evaluated and enacted?
3294000	3321000	Yeah, I think ultimately it depends on the political priorities that citizens themselves decide upon. I think the benefit of having that decided by means of political instruments is that you first ask what the fundamental preferences of people are in relation to resource throughput or energy consumption.
3321000	3343000	Instead of, you know, compared to capitalism or currently where people make primarily decisions based on private considerations and from day to day. So you first ask them to sketch broadly their social priorities in legislative assemblies, and then ask them to make private decisions within that framework.
3343000	3370000	So the benefit of this should be that it generates more, for instance, ecologically inclined decision making and decision outcomes. And ideally that would include some cap on consumption of resources based on some estimation of their, of the amount available and
3370000	3374000	and substitutes that might become available in the future.
3374000	3389000	So there would be a political process that defines these caps, and then there's also a political process that decides over how many of these resources are being allocated towards which sector, isn't that right?
3389000	3405000	Yeah, so you first determine the share of investment, given the availability of resources, which might be artificially capped for ecological concerns, and then the share of investment is channeled into different sectors.
3405000	3431000	Yeah, right. Okay. And maybe also to get a sense of what this would mean in terms of my individual life within these settings. I mean, since you have these different sectors, and you also already mentioned that the administrative sector is basically free on use.
3431000	3444000	So I think here the question also arises if there is something like universal basic services and how far you imagine those to go if they exist.
3444000	3467000	So is there a form of unconditional existential security, so to speak, that is there for everybody to enjoy? And then on the basis of that, some form of remuneration and bonus scheme is being developed? Or do you imagine it otherwise?
3467000	3486000	I think your broad outline is correct. The services would be freely available with the minor qualification that enough resources should be available for the level of demand. So there might be a nominal fee, if that is preferred compared to rationing, right?
3486000	3504000	If there's a shortage of good services, you either ration them, or you introduce some nominal fee, or maybe a little bit of both. But they should be freely available. So that concerns the care services, education, and so on.
3504000	3532000	And remuneration, because it's a different sector, it's not tied to productivity per se. You might, if that is necessary, have that works amongst each other, elect someone for a special program that might be new consumer items that are being introduced, or perhaps bonus payments, because it's not the same sort of productivity and bonus scheme that you would have in the cooperative sector.
3532000	3560000	So you mentioned care sector, but is it that all of my existential needs are covered unconditionally? So do I have housing? Do I have food? Do I have public transport? Do I have internet? Do I have all these kinds of things that are in today's world, a part of what I need in order to take part in society in a meaningful way?
3560000	3565000	Do I have this on an unconditional basis?
3565000	3590000	I think some of those might fall under the collective sector. I think, for instance, housing even should be guaranteed. It should be guaranteed by means of pouring in enough resources to build housing for everyone and to have them available at a price that is affordable to everyone.
3590000	3618000	However, because there's such a difference in preferences and needs, I think it would still be better to have it under the collective sector. So there should be some fee in the housing sector to allow people to say, well, you know, I prefer to pay a little less on housing and to live a little bit smaller so that I can consume more of some other item that I prefer more to allow these preferences to be expressed in this way.
3618000	3629000	So personally, I would say housing plays that under the collective sector and then have education and health care freely available.
3629000	3658000	Okay, I'm also asking because forms of incentive schemes and bonuses and stuff like that play quite a crucial role within your model. And of course, the question of how much pressure, to be honest, lies behind these schemes is very much tied to the question of whether or not there is an unconditional universal basic service that takes care of all my existential needs or not.
3658000	3685000	And I think it quite crucially creates a different form of compulsion when you kind of withhold existentially needed elements of subsistence, so to speak, in order to more or less pressure people into work. So I'm kind of pushing towards this aspect and question of the whole thing. Is there a compulsion to work?
3685000	3708000	Yeah, I would say there is a there is a compulsion. I think, you know, in the book, I labor under the assumption that this is the first generation of people living under socialism. And the idea of these bonuses include that well, there's another assumption of labor, including mundane tasks.
3708000	3725000	So necessary labor that has aspects that are mundane or perhaps not very pleasant. And that's on account of inheriting the technology, the level of technology and productivity of the current world, basically.
3725000	3753000	And on that account, it would be necessary, in my estimation, that people who are willing to contribute to the greater good, to the greater whole, who are one to harness sort of innate motivation to further reinforce those motivations by material means or by compensating them for basically their sacrifice or their efforts in contributing to society.
3753000	3774000	So in that respect, there is a compulsion that you should supply labor to society in order to consume if you are able. And that is simply because we cannot consume more than we produce. So there should be some pressure to contribute to social production.
3774000	3803000	Okay, so far, we have learned that there is a like political mandate, the political mandate kind of defines the scope of how much is being produced in total. So you have then different sectors, you have three sectors, one is a public sector, one is a administrative sector, and one is the corporate sector.
3803000	3823000	They have different logics inscribed with them. And the planning mechanism that you describe is mostly focused actually on the cooperative sector. So that's more or less the main focus that you have within your book when it comes to this planning mechanism.
3823000	3843000	Maybe before we look at how these plans come about, do you think that focusing so much on the cooperative sector, it relates to the kind of percentage of how much of the total throughput is going into this sector?
3843000	3865000	So is it in that regard, like the most important one or in terms of throughput? Or is it just that the other logics kind of are more easily described than the one that you go for with the cooperative sector is a bit more complicated. So you will need to have more time distilling the organizational paradigm behind that, so to speak.
3865000	3894000	Yeah, most of it has to do with, to a large extent, we know how to run public education without profit motive. And there's different approaches, obviously, that have been tried or being tried in healthcare and how to measure success or productivity, much more in Natura by looking at how many patients you've treated and so on.
3894000	3915000	So for me, it was more interesting and more complicated to look at how we could have an efficient cooperative sector or to replace basically private sectors. So that was the main reason, not so much the throughput being, I think might be evenly distributed, in fact, among these sectors.
3916000	3941000	Okay, so maybe then let's take a closer look at the planning process. There are different elements to this. Of course, there are different plans. There are one-year plans, there are five-year plans, there are long-term plans. And then there is an inherent logic that you try to apply towards this cooperative sector, which makes it, in your view, kind of unique in this way.
3941000	3962000	And this is an idea of, I would say, full-cost accounting, which you call Costa Ratchett. And this idea of full-cost accounting is being applied to the cooperative sector. So maybe let's start by laying out these different plans, and then we can go into why you think that Costa Ratchett is the right way to go.
3962000	3985000	So to give a brief overview, producers or the workers councils would make some combination of inputs based on the cost of their production and in reference to the production norms that are supplied by the central planners. We mentioned some of them previously.
3985000	4012000	So based on that, they formulate a production plan for a year. The cost of their inputs, at least some of them, will be influenced by the political priorities about, for instance, energy consumption, because if we use less energy, then it will be more costly and it's more prudent that we use energy efficiently in the interests of society and that we don't waste it and so on.
4012000	4033000	So these input prices are influenced by the political priorities and then producers formulate a production plan of the amount of equipment, labor, and so on that they will use. And it's the task of the central planners to anchor prices to cost of production.
4033000	4051000	And in this way, the producers are supplied with basically independent parameters that they can use to estimate what it costs to society to produce a certain item and what the benefit to society is.
4051000	4071000	So that's the basic idea. And these production norms are the norm of net output, that it's better to produce more using less, that it should be achievable, and that there shouldn't be an excess of supply or demand.
4071000	4094000	That would be wasteful as well. And given these basic success indicators, we can track the performance of producers using modern digital technologies and logistics and control, can track the flow of resources and obviously make adjustments from there.
4094000	4110000	Both producers and central planners might make adjustments based on this new information, so sort of a cybernetic element to it. And yeah, as I mentioned, the pricing also has to do with the political priorities.
4110000	4127000	So if we increase the share of investment that influences the price of certain investment goods, for example, so this is how the annual plans and the larger political priorities come together. So it's by means of this sort of price mechanism.
4127000	4156000	And I mean, an aspect that is really important for you, you also mentioned it before, is this idea of responsibility. So it's very important for you that you have these cooperatives, these socialist enterprises to be responsible for their actions in order to not engage in, I don't know, wasteful behavior and kind of use the resources.
4157000	4181000	Efficiently that they are using. So in order to bring this idea of responsibility about, you refer to this idea of Kosrachet. Maybe you could describe to us what this means, where you got it from and how people can and should, in your opinion, can and should stick to Kosrachet.
4181000	4210000	Yeah, yeah, it's basically a Soviet term. So Kosrachet, the best translation is not a direct translation, I believe, it's basically full or cost accounting. And it comes from the early Soviet period. And basically, the reason that I use this term instead of just cost accounting is to emphasize that we are dealing with abstract reality, but reality, nonetheless, is not a direct translation.
4211000	4233000	In the sense that these were real dilemmas faced by real people in certain real circumstance of constructing socialism. So I just like to use that term to emphasize this idea. Yeah, that is a real challenge hidden within this debate about constructing socialism.
4233000	4252000	And more substantively, it means that each economic unit has a cost account, so it's responsible for the cost that they make, that these costs are recorded and available, and that we can compare their costs to the results of their activity.
4252000	4272000	And then finally, that we can have responsibility for these costs and these results. So if we lack any of these factors, it would not be possible to assign responsibility and ensure that workers are invested in the outcome of their activities.
4272000	4290000	So that's for me is why it's so important that we want workers to be invested in the outcome being beneficial to society, and not for them to consume resources without adding anything useful to their community.
4290000	4307000	So on that account, I found it important to emphasize this point, as well as that it's a dilemma that has already been faced previously, and that we need to take, obtain these lessons and digest these lessons for the future.
4307000	4334000	What was really interesting to me is that, I mean, when it comes to the political sphere, you kind of go a different route, more or less, because there you also argue that it would be important for people to kind of identify themselves with the collective aspects of society and not only retreat into an individualism, so to speak.
4334000	4345000	If one would want to be polemic, then one might say that in the public sphere, you use education and in the economic sphere, you use a form of diamond punishment.
4345000	4360000	So the way in which you try to achieve that people are not only being quote unquote selfish, but do consider the collective aspects of a societal organization, so to speak.
4360000	4369000	So the mechanism within the economic sphere is very much oriented towards this idea of economic punishment and incentivation.
4369000	4375000	So I was wondering why focus so much on this aspect?
4375000	4390000	I would even say this is more or less the only tool that you use within the economic sphere in order to provide for this identification with the more macro and collective aspects.
4390000	4403000	And I would be curious if you thought about alternative ways through which this identification with the collective aspects of my own doing could be brought about.
4403000	4425000	Because I'm personally actually quite skeptical of the idea that these types of mechanism design that ultimately treat the subjects through a very primitive mechanism of diamond punishment will result in what you intend it should result in.
4425000	4447000	Well, it's not not purely the only mechanism is an important, I suppose, mediating factor, but the production norms are also used to ensure that workers of different collectives or production units will basically negotiate the setting of output targets amongst each other.
4447000	4452000	So it's not to compete for a market for the largest market share.
4452000	4459000	So there is an element of the production norms encouraging a larger, broader outlook.
4459000	4464000	Sorry to interrupt, but how? I don't actually see it.
4464000	4481000	How are the different enterprises in your model incentivized to really coordinate horizontally with each other and kind of share information and work with each other towards a shared goal?
4481000	4486000	Well, they one element is that their plans have to be realistic.
4486000	4502000	So they have to communicate to each other their productive capacity and their ability to absorb, let's say, increase in demand, because if they fail to do so, then a plan that seems realistic might not be.
4502000	4511000	So there's this mutual interest to share reliable data on your productive capacity on your plans for output.
4511000	4524000	So that creates an incentive to share information about changes in plans and whether it is even possible for some production units to increase production if they lack the inputs of another manufacturer.
4524000	4533000	So there is an incentive there to share information in addition to production plans being publicly available.
4533000	4539000	So in addition to having their own innate incentive, there is also public scrutiny itself.
4539000	4546000	Yeah, so that's, I think, the main, main, main way that you could achieve cooperation in those areas.
4546000	4552000	So setting of output targets to prevent overproduction.
4552000	4566000	So if they estimate that demand for a certain group goes up, they have to coordinate, say, well, we can each increase production by this amount to absorb the increase in demand rather than just decide for themselves.
4566000	4571000	We're going to carve out the largest market share and aggressively coin in the market.
4571000	4575000	So there is the element of horizontal coordination there.
4575000	4591000	Okay, interesting, because, I mean, this I can see, and I really like the idea, actually, that you aim for overcoming a certain idea of competition between horizontal actors as well.
4591000	4594000	But there seemed to be an element of competition nonetheless.
4594000	4599000	So I would be interested in getting into that as well.
4599000	4612000	So, I mean, one example would be that I was asking myself that if a socialist enterprise finds a good way of producing a given use value more efficiently,
4612000	4621000	then what would be the incentive for this socialist enterprise to share this information with the other enterprises that are also producing this specific use value?
4621000	4631000	Because if they didn't share it, it would be much easier for them to fulfill the average within this specific industry sector.
4631000	4636000	So that might be an incentive not to cooperate and not to share this information.
4636000	4647000	So I was quite curious on this relationship between competition and corporation, because it seems as if both kind of seems to have a place within your model, no?
4647000	4656000	Yeah, yeah. So there's an element of horizontal cooperation, as I mentioned, dealing with output targets.
4656000	4664000	When we're talking about productivity and being more efficient, then there's an element of competition.
4664000	4674000	And the reason why there's an element of competition is because we don't know, from a central vantage point, we don't know the real production possibilities, right?
4674000	4684000	It is the basic problem of central planning. So then competition becomes the element by which we might gauge the benchmark of productivity.
4684000	4696000	And the way that it would deal with your example depends a little bit on how this work collective has managed to increase their productivity.
4696000	4706000	If it's purely by changing the organizational form, it would be difficult to sort of compel them or impel them to share that publicly.
4706000	4716000	But on the other hand, if they use a certain type of equipment, then that would be publicly available information.
4717000	4734000	So you might not prevent there's some strategic approach to increasing your own score, but you can sort of check it, at least in the area of using certain equipment, because you can see the combination of inputs that they use.
4734000	4743000	In addition, Leibman, I think, suggests that you could encourage these producers to share the information, their best practice, and reward them for it.
4743000	4772000	So that might be another option. And it might be possible if they can't figure out how they've grown so productive, it might be possible to send out a research team subject to the observation effect, which you wouldn't prevent it entirely to have strategic decision making like this, where you sort of conceal some of the strategic information, but you can minimize it, I suppose.
4773000	4786000	So we would have a central planning board that mainly operates through parametric control in the form of fixed prices.
4786000	4798000	So this is more or less the framework in which highly autonomous, but not fully autonomous socialist enterprises operate.
4798000	4813000	They do not have the ability to change prices, but they do have the ability to change the amount of output they are able to net output they are able to produce on the basis of these prices.
4813000	4828000	So this is this might be fluctuating. These enterprises are being evaluated in terms of how much net output they are being able to produce, given a certain set of inputs that they can attain.
4828000	4852000	And this is measured against a type of average within their own sector, so they can be given a certain score of success, so to speak, which is able to show how well they have done in terms of an efficient use of resources tied to this score.
4852000	4867000	They will get a form of bonus if they did well, and they will get a, I don't know, maybe let's say normal remuneration that does not provide a bonus if they did not so well.
4867000	4876000	If they just did something, if they did it really, really, really bad, it might be that they will not get any resources the next time.
4877000	4890000	So that is kind of the overall setup, so to speak. You have a vertical axis where you have mainly fixed prices as a parametric control.
4890000	4900000	You have horizontal coordination between the different enterprises that is both based on cooperation as well as on competition.
4900000	4918000	So you will have both of these elements, and there is a certain type of pressure, so to speak, that is on the shoulders of the enterprises that they should do kind of reasonably well in their production.
4918000	4927000	Otherwise, they will go down basically. So something that is sometimes called hard budget constraints, I think.
4927000	4940000	So that would be kind of the overall sketch, and then we saw that there are one-year plans which are mostly done through the enterprises.
4940000	4956000	So there is a kind of bottom-up planning element to this where based on these parametric information, the prices, the fixed prices, so the enterprises devise one-year plans where they announce what types of resources they will need.
4956000	4971000	There is also an aspect of a more detailed one-year plan, I think. If I remember correctly, at least for the upcoming month or something, you would have to provide a more detailed aspect.
4971000	4987000	But there are also five-year plans which are, correct me if I'm wrong, politically negotiated, so to speak, and which kind of provide an orientation in terms of general outlook of the economy.
4987000	4998000	Do we want to go into green energy more? Do we kind of have less energy throughput overall and stuff like that?
4998000	5010000	So this is kind of handled politically, so to speak, and then you would have really long-term planning as well, which I think we didn't really touch upon yet, no?
5010000	5013000	Are you satisfied with my sketch?
5013000	5021000	Yes, certainly. Yeah, we skipped a little bit the month-to-month planning and also a longer term as well.
5021000	5030000	Yeah, even the five-year plans are guidelines. It might be a little bit too much to say that they're plans as such.
5030000	5044000	They form guidelines within which plans are formed and even longer perspective plans are moving average of those plans, basically. So they're given sort of a long-term orientation.
5044000	5057000	Obviously, the more long-term you plan, the less reliable it becomes. So it's just a point of orientation for policy making and political decision making.
5057000	5070000	But related to that, I mean, this would be something different than, for example, the notion of investment steering within the model of Pat Devine, for example.
5070000	5090000	Because I remember in your book, you kind of say that you think that the idea of political control over investment is not what you aim for, but that this should still be the responsibility of the semi-autonomous enterprises.
5090000	5105000	If I understand you correctly, then there would be an element of direct control of investment where it relates to the collective sector, especially obviously the administrative sector as well.
5105000	5120000	An energy transition would require a more hands-on approach by public authorities. So then I suppose there would be more direct control of energy infrastructure as well, if I understand your question correctly.
5120000	5137000	Yeah, maybe let me rephrase this, put it a bit more clearly. Of course, for the public sector and for the what you call administrative sector, it's clear to me that you do have political control over investment in these spheres.
5137000	5156000	But then there's the cooperative sector and within other models, for example, within Pat Devine's model, he stresses very much that a political control over investment would be an important way of steering the direction of the economy, so to speak.
5156000	5173000	So what in your model is mainly done through fixed prices and parametric control would in his model be done through very decisive political decisions over investment allocation.
5173000	5196000	But if I understand it correctly, that in your model within the cooperative sector, the enterprises themselves would decide over these questions of investment and there would be a, so to speak, cumulative aspect to this idea of where investment should go or where it shouldn't go.
5196000	5200000	So this is a difference to the other models, so to speak.
5200000	5227000	Yeah, I think so. I think your assessment is correct in that. I think the best way to achieve that in an incentive compatible way is more indirectly via parametric control by reshaping sort of the infrastructure or the parameters rather than directly and direct negotiation or direct decision making.
5227000	5245000	Okay, so we have a picture of some of the macro elements, but I think it would be good to relate it to questions of similarity and difference to a capitalist mode of production.
5245000	5261000	Because what I really liked about the way that you approach it is that you aim to overcome certain aspects of a capitalist mode of production, namely things like the profit motive and the value form, stuff like that.
5261000	5278000	But at the same time, hearing about the model, one might say, okay, there's still remuneration, there's still a compulsion to work, there are still ideas of the separation of a sphere of production, a sphere of reproduction.
5278000	5297000	So many of the elements that we see today and that are also being criticized, for example, coming from a feminist perspective, but also coming from other perspectives, for example, value form theory, who are very much pushing towards overcoming certain central elements of capitalism.
5297000	5302000	So other elements you do not overcome within your model.
5302000	5325000	And I was wondering how you reflect upon this, I don't know, this kind of gradual or maybe gradual overcoming or this necessity to engage with certain structural logics that we see today and that should arguably be overcome.
5325000	5336000	Yeah, so it has to do, I think, with my primary priority being flashing out socialism that is feasible now.
5336000	5353000	In addition to abstracting away certain discussions and themes in the interest of time, I was also focused on those issues, which I thought would first emerge when you start to construct a post capitalist society.
5353000	5374000	So for me, those questions of attaining efficiency and ensuring that at least partially selfish people can be rendered into service of the public interest and socialism, how we can design mechanisms that fulfill these tasks.
5374000	5388000	For me, that was the priority. So to an extent that explains this particular focus, as I mentioned, it's the idea that this would be the first generation living on socialism.
5388000	5405000	And so you do inherit certain tendencies and a separation of certain spheres. And the idea is to overcome some of these barriers and figure out as well along the way, the best way to approach those things.
5405000	5422000	So talking about the separation of leisure and production, I think it's basically best to leave those issues for a later stage of development and for now focus on what we can achieve within a single generation.
5422000	5445000	I mean, I think one of the inherent questions that come up with such an approach would be that it sounds as if it might run the risk of by reproducing certain logics of government, so to speak, certain logics in which the subjects are being addressed.
5445000	5459000	By reproducing these logics, you kind of inhibit that which is needed in order to overcome what you think of as a first stage or whatever.
5459000	5483000	So you might not come to the later stage if you approach it through such a paradigm, because it basically doesn't succeed in stepping out of addressing people in a certain way that is suspicious of their ability, basically.
5483000	5494000	But at the same time, the whole thing would kind of strive towards basing itself on this ability.
5494000	5516000	So there's an inherent contradiction in terms of how the model makes use of certain mechanisms and how it articulates a goal that lies beyond these mechanisms themselves and the logic that is inscribed within them.
5516000	5532000	Yeah, I think there is such a risk in the sense that by abstracting away this potential future stage, you sort of materially reinforce those tendencies that you want to curb in effect.
5532000	5554000	And again, that is basically the consequence of the focus that I elected to adopt, basically to test the waters of, given the assumption of soft egoism, what are the necessities that arise when you construct a model of socialism.
5554000	5573000	And it's certainly something that, you know, in further interrogation and scrutiny, one would have to address if it's possible for these sort of mechanisms of material reinforcement and bonuses if they wither away or if they reinforce these tendencies.
5573000	5587000	But for now, again, my focus lies with testing the waters of what is feasible now under these assumptions, and later possibly we can reevaluate those assumptions as well.
5587000	5593000	And would you say that these assumptions are assumptions of economism and productivism?
5593000	5616000	Well, to an extent, I think the assumptions are at least partially valid. So for instance, it is productivistic, this approach, but I think that that is a necessary element also of trying to have a society that is more efficient because ultimately you don't want to produce fewer things with more effort,
5616000	5629000	which goes at the expense of leisure and quality of life, because you're not just talking about useless stuff with also medical equipment and tools for improving the welfare of people.
5629000	5643000	So in that sense, I do want to defend a little bit those assumptions that lead to this sort of productivistic approach, that it is important to have a high degree of efficiency and so on.
5643000	5649000	Yeah, so to that extent, I do want to defend those assumptions at least.
5649000	5663000	Yeah, I mean, I guess at the end, it might be a question of what you prioritize. So I'm quite sure that none of the people engaged in the planning debate would argue that efficiency is irrelevant.
5663000	5684000	So that's something everybody's kind of aware of, of course, also with regard to the ecological question and that we should not kind of excessively blow our resources into the air, whatever, or consume them senselessly.
5684000	5705000	So efficiency, of course, is an aspect that we need to consider, but maybe the role it plays or how much you kind of build your whole model or system around the optimization of efficiency might be up for discussion.
5705000	5724000	And there might be different approaches that at the end might lead to results that could be equally compatible with the reproduction of our ecosphere, so to speak, but do not start from a perspective of efficiency as the highest priority.
5724000	5743000	So I think there are different modes that one could devise and different also modes of relating to these questions that are not coming primarily from questions of efficiency, but still are able to lead to desirable outcomes, so to speak.
5743000	5761000	I would like to also get into the question of the subjects that you imagine, because this was really a crucial element within both the political aspect of your model, as well as the economic aspects of your model.
5761000	5773000	And I was kind of a little bit irritated by this notion of the subject because it has a very, very strong normative notion to it.
5773000	5782000	And it to me seemed to be a very small corridor that is being allowed as a quote unquote good subject.
5782000	5787000	So there is a certain idea of what an ideal political subject is in republicanism.
5787000	5798000	And this is also a very active subject and a subject of participation, a subject of self mastery, I think you call it at some point.
5798000	5827000	And this was kind of irritating to me because for me at least a polity or a demos should consist of a whole variety of different subjectivations that do not necessarily need to conform to such an idea of self mastery and activity in order to be resourceful for the community as a whole.
5827000	5849000	I would argue. So it's not just these active subjects that do contribute to society, but subjects that have very, very different qualities than this ideal republican subject, at least in my books, very much of worth for the community as well.
5850000	5864000	So I was kind of struck by this very, very idealized subject that you aim for in the political sphere and as well in the economic sphere, because it comes up there as well.
5865000	5882000	Yeah, it's certainly something that I've inherited, I think, from republicanism, the idea that humans are in that sense a social animal, require participation in public life to acquire those tools of self mastery through active participation.
5882000	5908000	And I think that's, I should say, a bit of a strong normative commitment to make, although I would admit that being resourceful and being active in public life allows for a huge variety in itself, whether you participate in a recreational club or something else, or whether you serve public office.
5908000	5917000	So even this sort of active participation in public life would allow for a variety of ways to, I suppose, participate in public life.
5918000	5928000	So it is a strong normative commitment, but I don't think that the corridor is as narrow as you say. There's a variety of ways that you can participate in public life.
5929000	5936000	Underlining this is the idea that social animals, it is important that we participate in public life.
5936000	5952000	And I mean, there's a kind of fishy aspect to it as well when it comes to the question of how you think that this could be achieved for everybody.
5952000	5962000	So, I mean, my argument would be that not everybody conforms to this ideal and for a good reason.
5963000	5969000	And if your argument is, well, everybody should, then my question is, how do you get them to do so?
5969000	5986000	Well, I suppose it begins with the institution of public education and collective child rearing, where people are socialized in norms, not even necessarily directly.
5986000	6001000	It doesn't have to be specific values, just participating in class and so on with the provision of full employment to have the expectation that everyone was able to contribute to social production.
6002000	6014000	And that sends you harness the, I suppose, the innate want of most people, I suppose, with some exceptions to be sociable and to contribute to a greater whole beyond themselves.
6014000	6030000	And again, that might assume a variety of forms, including that it might extend to religious participation or whatever else that they might prefer is allowing them the resources to participate in collective life from very early on.
6031000	6035000	Yeah, I mean, if you stated that way, I think we're not that far apart.
6035000	6046000	Because if the premise is that you should give people the resources to take part in collective life, then of course I'm on board.
6046000	6067000	So that's a good thing. I guess the difference might be in nuance when it comes to how much I would push people towards this very specific idea of activity and participation and how they should act in accordance with Republican values.
6068000	6073000	I would allow for more slack, I guess, when it comes to that as well.
6073000	6083000	Well, I think there is a sort of pessimism also in what I expect, the amount of people I expect to participate in political life, for instance.
6083000	6090000	So it's not entirely that I have a strict sense of what an idea of Republican citizen is.
6090000	6105000	And there should also be some option to opt out even of work, although I think there should be some moral obstacles in the way of that.
6105000	6116000	Oh, but that's interesting because one could also frame it coming from a very different perspective, stating that in order for your Republicanism to work,
6116000	6130000	you need a certain amount of a specific type of human material, so to speak, and therefore you kind of need to bring about these individuals in order to make the whole thing work.
6130000	6135000	And it's coming, but this is coming from the opposite direction.
6135000	6149000	That's not coming from the direction of the individuals, but it's coming from the direction of an ideal, abstract ideal of what a political community should look like.
6149000	6157000	And then it goes to asking what kinds of subjects you need in order to make this ideal work.
6157000	6161000	So that's a bit of a funny take.
6161000	6163000	I suppose, I suppose.
6163000	6178000	OK, so you focus very much on the theoretical development of Republican socialism in order to provide a better idea of what it is that the socialist movement, at least in your opinion, should strive for.
6178000	6182000	How does this relate to our praxis today?
6182000	6194000	And how can these two be brought together, this idea of a socialist Republicanism or Republican socialism and our contemporary present?
6194000	6197000	So how do you think about the transition, basically?
6197000	6200000	Well, I haven't fleshed it out in detail.
6200000	6214000	I hope to in the future have some time to contemplate this a little bit more deeply, so I can only tell by broad strokes how I would approach the transition.
6214000	6218000	And I think it would proceed from broad coalition.
6218000	6231000	So to have some reformity within the broader socialist movement that might appeal to different segments of the working population.
6231000	6242000	So that stems then from an entirely different approach of what we might call neogrammatism, that there's not necessarily unitary interest of the working class.
6242000	6246000	So we need to appeal to different layers and segments in different ways.
6246000	6259000	And one of them being Republicanism and appealing to those elements within the working population that might be, I suppose, open to those ideas.
6259000	6274000	So just to have a broad palette of flavors, I think that is probably how I think the issue should be approached of building a counter movement, basically.
6274000	6281000	And Tim, there's a last question that I ask all of my guests, and it is, if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
6281000	6293000	It makes me joyful. Well, I suppose in the area of politics is the opening up of this debate.
6293000	6302000	The reason that I decided to delve deeply into this subject was sort of the lack of debate on the issue.
6302000	6308000	There were some, obviously, but I'm noticing, and maybe it's because I'm participating myself,
6308000	6312000	but I'm noticing more people becoming involved and interested in these questions.
6312000	6331000	So in that area, certainly is optimistic, cautious, cautiously optimistic, because it is a very difficult subject and will require a lot of work and fleshing out before we have maybe a satisfactory model in full.
6331000	6337000	But I suppose that that would be my source of joy in that area.
6337000	6341000	Perfect. Tim, thanks so much for being part of Future Histories.
