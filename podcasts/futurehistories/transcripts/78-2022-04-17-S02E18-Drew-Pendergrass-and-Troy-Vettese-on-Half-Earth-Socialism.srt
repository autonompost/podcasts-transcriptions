00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,840
Welcome to Future Histories.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,400
My name is Jan Groos,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,800
and it is my great pleasure to welcome

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,620
Troy Witteze and Drew Pendergrass in today's episode.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,840
They are the authors of the newly released book,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,080
Half-Earth Socialism.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,440
And since Troy and Drew do see democratic economic planning

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,920
as an integral part of what they propose

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
as Half-Earth Socialism, I was intrigued to read it.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,740
And it has been an interesting read for me, I have to say,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,180
because there are quite some elements in it

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,360
that I kind of stumbled over, I would say.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,620
And this is, of course, always great for a good interview

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,440
and an interesting discussion.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,620
We didn't really touch the veganism aspect

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,020
of their proposal in detail.

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,060
I'll leave that to others to discuss.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,020
But we did go into planning, of course, in quite some detail.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,760
And I think it made an interesting exchange.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,920
I certainly enjoyed talking to Troy and to Drew,

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,840
and I hope you will enjoy listening to it.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,240
Before we start, I would like to thank David, Fabian,

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,960
Lucas, and Wilfried for their donations.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,760
And I would like to welcome BjÃ¶rn, Manuel, and Gereon

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,640
as patrons of Future Histories.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,320
Thank you so much.

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,120
If you want to support Future Histories,

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,720
but you do not have the monetary resources to do so,

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,080
then first of all, thank you too.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,420
It's highly appreciated.

31
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,900
And then there is an absolutely brilliant way

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,860
to support the project in non-monetary form

33
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,060
by transcribing your favorite episode.

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,980
There's a collaborative transcription project

35
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,060
that has formed around Future Histories,

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,060
and I want to thank everybody who has already contributed.

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,160
So if there's an episode you like,

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,520
and you see a value in providing a transcript of the episode,

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,760
and I would argue there are many benefits from a transcript,

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,700
then please find a link and a contact email

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,980
in the show notes.

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,800
So go for it, and thank you.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,920
But now please enjoy today's episode

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,360
with Drew Pendergrass and Troy Wieteser

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,160
on Half-Earth Socialism.

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,320
["Half-Earth Socialism"]

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,280
Welcome, Troy.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,840
Welcome, Drew.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,560
Thanks for having us.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a pleasure.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,520
Let's start with the definition.

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,280
What is Half-Earth Socialism?

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Half-Earth Socialism is a kind of socialism

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,320
based on the recognition of ecological limits,

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,640
but also the limits to our understanding

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
of the natural world.

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,520
And therefore, we're saying that the environmental crisis

58
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,700
can only become overcome by socialism

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,840
because it is only socialism that humans can decide

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,960
to manage economic growth,

61
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,640
which is impossible under capitalism.

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,640
And then we're also saying that socialists

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,880
have to be environmentalists

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,480
because they have to realize

65
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
that total control over nature is impossible

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
because the more we intervene in nature,

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
the more risks we take,

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
such as pandemics or climate change.

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,240
So Half-Earth Socialism is that in a nutshell,

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,960
and it's also arguing for noiratian,

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,360
no conscious control of the economy.

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,580
And we propose rewilding half the planet,

73
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,260
which is the Half-Earth component,

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,100
and having energy quotas and veganism

75
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,620
to reduce our impact on nature

76
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,140
while also ensuring a good life for all.

77
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,420
I actually know if I have anything to add.

78
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,820
Troy, you did a very good definition.

79
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,660
Thanks.

80
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,900
And before you set out to describe your ideas

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,800
about how to address climate catastrophe in the book,

82
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,020
you dissect some other approaches,

83
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,660
three approaches actually,

84
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,420
that are brought forward by others.

85
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,860
And those are bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration,

86
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,140
it's short B-E-C-C-S, nuclear power,

87
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,640
and the idea of Half-Earth itself, actually,

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,860
because the origins of this idea of Half-Earth

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,700
are not quite innocent.

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,580
And there are strands tied to this concept

91
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,540
that have, I think, some quite Malthusian ring to it,

92
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,940
as well as some nativist tendencies, if I'm not mistaken.

93
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,620
So these are three approaches that you dissect

94
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,160
before you lay out your own proposal within the book.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,220
Maybe let's take a look at these three approaches,

96
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,600
and maybe you can tell us what the shortcomings

97
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,180
of these quote unquote solutions are.

98
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,500
Yeah, so you're describing here our kind of look at

99
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,780
the sort of half solutions on offer

100
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,700
by sort of mainstream environmental slash modeling.

101
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,260
So we can take them in turn.

102
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,460
So the first option, BEX,

103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,340
is an interesting kind of modeling artifact.

104
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,780
So the idea with bioengineering

105
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,500
with carbon capture and storage, or BEX,

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,260
is that you have plantations of probably trees,

107
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,100
and then you cut these down,

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,740
you burn it for energy, for electricity,

109
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,280
you capture the carbon emitted from the trees,

110
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,220
and then you bury that carbon underground.

111
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,900
And the idea is that this is a carbon negative energy source

112
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,820
because the carbon released by the trees,

113
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,620
the trees capture carbon, they grow,

114
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,660
capture that carbon, you put it underground.

115
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,900
And this is, believe it or not,

116
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,220
integral to pretty much all of the intergovernmental panel

117
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,780
on climate change, IPCC's 1.5 degree models.

118
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,740
So limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees,

119
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,500
and even a lot of the two degree models,

120
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,660
the idea is that they're trying to model

121
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,260
how you might do this energy transition.

122
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,020
It's very hard to do a massive transition very quickly.

123
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,940
So a lot of the models have overshoot

124
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,940
or emit too much or something,

125
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,620
and you need to have negative emissions

126
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,420
to push you back down.

127
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,020
They're often very large amounts of negative emissions.

128
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,700
So the models produce,

129
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,220
these are models that are running blindly.

130
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,820
They're just neoclassical models

131
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,460
with a climate model attached.

132
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,500
And they kind of blindly are like,

133
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,580
okay, let's take three India's worth of land,

134
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,980
plant some tree plantations, burn it.

135
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,140
Let's make some nice assumptions

136
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,540
that this is a carbon negative,

137
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,660
like that there's not an unintended consequence

138
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,660
by like say, soils control a lot of the biosphere's carbon.

139
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Maybe by doing this, we might mess up the soils

140
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,500
and the soils might start emitting carbon,

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,700
bracket all that.

142
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,260
And then if you do this, okay, you have a nice solution.

143
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,100
You can have your energy transition

144
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,820
with a lot of fruit to spare.

145
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,860
And the bottom line is this is sort of

146
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,060
obviously never going to happen.

147
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,060
It's a massive project with no movement behind it.

148
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,020
It's just, it's a modeling artifact.

149
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,540
And if anything, it's harder to do the energy transition

150
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,820
than these models make it sound

151
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,580
because BEX is so integral to many of these models.

152
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,180
Now there are models that don't involve BEX

153
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,700
and they involve a much more rapid energy transition.

154
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,580
And that's more aligned with what we are talking about,

155
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,980
things like large amounts of energy use reductions.

156
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,140
The second proposal that we talk about is nuclear power.

157
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,460
And we're more specifically talking to a specific strain

158
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,740
of environmentalists who wants to build

159
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,180
like a nuclear power plant a week or something like this,

160
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,380
or maybe even more.

161
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,980
There's two nuclear power plants a week,

162
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,860
Troy is telling me.

163
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,540
Yeah, so the idea is,

164
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,020
we build up this massive electricity capacity

165
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,380
and then together with a big electrification project,

166
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,060
you solve the climate crisis

167
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,220
by putting everything on this big nuclear power grid.

168
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,860
But this is also seems a little bit ridiculous.

169
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,700
For one thing, nuclear power plants are very hard

170
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,420
and expensive to build and very complex machines.

171
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,780
And we said in the book that

172
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,020
even if nuclear power plants are safer now,

173
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,700
there's still a pretty high risk

174
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,540
of something like a Fukushima like disaster,

175
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,180
even with our current number of nuclear power plants.

176
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,980
So if you add a bunch more, that risk goes up.

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,980
We still haven't solved the nuclear waste problem.

178
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,220
The fact that nuclear power is connected

179
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,500
to nuclear weapons in an intimate way

180
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,420
is also another existential threat to worry about.

181
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,500
And then also the fact that

182
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,580
if you build this many power plants,

183
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,420
you are manning a lot of uranium.

184
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,660
Uranium is a pretty nasty thing to mine.

185
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,300
It gets impure pretty quickly

186
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,060
once you mine out of the good, I guess,

187
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,300
the high quality ores.

188
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,660
And then you end up with some problems

189
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,900
and propose solutions to do different kinds of reactors

190
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,620
like fast speed reactors have problems

191
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,260
because they use sodium as a coolant

192
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,420
and sodium explodes when exposed to air.

193
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,620
And that's just, so we just don't think

194
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,820
that this is a plausible plan.

195
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,380
And then the final one we talk about is the half earth.

196
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,660
And many on the left are familiar

197
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,060
with the difficulties of the conservation movement,

198
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,340
the quite nasty side of it.

199
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,980
And we don't hold any punches here.

200
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,140
So the half earth idea comes out

201
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
of an intellectual tradition

202
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,940
that has pretty nasty relationship

203
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,260
with indigenous peoples and this sort of thing.

204
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,900
And E.O. Wilson, who ends up taking it on

205
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,020
and popularizing it in a 2014 book,

206
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,940
he is better than some of these conservationists,

207
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,900
but that's not saying much

208
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,060
because he is quite notorious for his sociobiology

209
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
is sort of determinism on the basis of genes

210
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,300
and that sort of thing.

211
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,820
So pretty antithetical to what we believe on the left.

212
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,100
But while interrogating this tradition,

213
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,420
what we think is important is that mass extinction,

214
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,020
the ongoing sixth mass extinction in earth's history

215
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,540
is something that we on the left need to care about.

216
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,220
So the sixth mass extinction is going on now

217
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,020
driven by human activity.

218
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,700
There have been five previous mass extinctions.

219
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,940
They are disastrous for life on earth,

220
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,740
not just because we should care about other species

221
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,980
on this planet, but in terms of...

222
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,700
In science, we call it ecosystem services.

223
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,060
So nature does things for us, like keep the water clean,

224
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,180
pollinate our crops, make sure that disease is kept at bay,

225
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,860
all sorts of vital functions.

226
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,060
And if this ecosystem functioning and also carbon capture,

227
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,500
like half of the carbon we've emitted has been captured

228
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
by either the oceans or the land.

229
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
Some of that's inorganic,

230
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,140
but a good bit of it is through life on earth.

231
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,060
So these are just parts of the planet

232
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,700
that we can't afford to lose.

233
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,180
And the thing that drives mass extinction,

234
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,060
perhaps the most is habitat loss.

235
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,300
So we need to take seriously the idea

236
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,020
that habitat loss is a problem.

237
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,060
It's driving a major environmental crisis.

238
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
It's a crisis that will affect all of us

239
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,860
that affects our prospects of having a good life.

240
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,660
And it affects other species on this planet

241
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,100
that we should care about too.

242
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,020
So basically we shouldn't throw the baby out

243
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,460
with the bath water, but we shouldn't like maybe

244
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,220
not interrogate the bath water, I guess,

245
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,020
to use this metaphor badly.

246
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,620
So we talk about how biodiversity is higher

247
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,820
in indigenous managed lands than nature preserves

248
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,980
in many cases.

249
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,180
So there's no need to inherit these nasty sides

250
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,260
of conservation, but we still need to take seriously

251
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,100
the need to protect nature.

252
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,020
Okay, that's interesting because now you kind

253
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,020
of implicitly already answered a question I had regarding

254
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,300
why you stick to this concept of half earth,

255
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,300
because to me it felt as if maybe because of this history

256
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,220
that this concept has and the line of thinking

257
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,980
that underlies it, which has a, in some parts,

258
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,500
slightly semi-authoritarian touch, I'd say.

259
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,340
It begs the question how to avoid including

260
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,180
these highly problematic aspects of the concept

261
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,060
of half earth, because it's not just the ignorance

262
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,900
towards indigenous knowledges and different other problems

263
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,900
that this conservative conservationist movement has,

264
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
but also, at least to me, when reading the book,

265
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,180
you will always come into a position where if you start

266
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,180
by having a very concrete idea of how things should be

267
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,580
in the beginning, you will come into the position

268
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,300
where you will kind of have to construct a system

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,700
that necessarily, quote unquote, forces people

270
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,700
into what you believe is the correct answer to the problem.

271
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,860
And so there's a specific line of argument,

272
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,620
a line of reasoning underlying this whole idea

273
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,820
that kind of brings you in the territory

274
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,020
where you will have to confront the question

275
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,020
of, in this case, also central authoritarian tendencies.

276
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,500
But I don't think we're naive liberals here

277
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,980
where we think that, oh, it's just a matter

278
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,860
of individual choice that's gonna solve any of these problems.

279
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,660
I mean, we don't use, we don't think this way

280
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,980
when it comes to fossil fuels.

281
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,380
I think socialists are comfortable enough saying

282
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,860
we have to get rid of fossil fuels quickly,

283
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,260
and that's going to require how we live,

284
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,980
and it's gonna force how a lot of people

285
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,180
who use a lot of fossil fuels to change how they live.

286
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,060
And that's, we're also quite comfortable saying

287
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,940
we want equality, that means no more rich people.

288
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,180
I mean, we're happy saying all these things,

289
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,460
but when it comes to meat or the animal question in general,

290
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,700
then people say, oh, hey, you can't say that.

291
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,300
And I think on the left, we need to have a real discussion

292
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,300
about what is a socialist ethic towards animals

293
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,900
and what is the relationship we want with animals.

294
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,660
And this book tries to push that forward.

295
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,180
But we make clear in the book that our approach

296
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
or what we're arguing in the book

297
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,700
is really two separate things.

298
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,700
One is a way to think about what socialism is and practice.

299
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,300
And this is where we draw Noirat.

300
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,780
He's saying it's important to have this utopian tradition

301
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,260
where people come up with total plans

302
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,860
or what he calls like social engineering,

303
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,780
and then people compare these utopian future plans

304
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,740
and then vote on them and they decide upon them.

305
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,020
And versus, and the second part would be

306
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,060
what we think those future plans should be.

307
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,780
We offer our own future plan.

308
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,500
But we say quite clearly,

309
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,420
also because at some level we have no power,

310
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,820
we can't force anyone to do anything.

311
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,820
But we say, if you don't agree with us, that's fine.

312
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,860
But then we have to make trade-off somewhere.

313
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,180
We have to say, okay, we're happy to have

314
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,860
synodic disease and mass extinction, and that's okay.

315
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,700
Or we have to live with more nuclear power plants.

316
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,900
And it's, you know, maybe as we can't produce enough energy

317
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,060
for easily high energy quotas or whatever it is,

318
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,220
but we need to have this discussion

319
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,380
about what kind of life we want.

320
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,020
And to kind of keep the veil over this future society

321
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,780
is not proven to be a successful strategy.

322
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,500
And I think it also is missing the key insight of Noirat,

323
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,300
which is socialism is this collective decision

324
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,260
over our future, and to keep it obscure

325
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,460
is actually quite a neoliberal move.

326
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,420
Like only the market can know something as complex as this.

327
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,620
So again, the book is doing two things,

328
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,740
and we like to think we make a good case

329
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,980
for vegan rewilding,

330
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,580
but we want to have more debates

331
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,500
about what this future should be.

332
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,460
Yeah, democracy is a very big theme in the book,

333
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,860
and it's a major part of,

334
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,500
in the portion of the book that's dealing with planning,

335
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,980
because we kind of take that,

336
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,340
the magnitude of changes required

337
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,820
to do the energy transition alone,

338
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,980
let alone address other parts of the climate crisis

339
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,100
is simply a massive task for planning.

340
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,500
And the question is, how can you plan

341
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,900
in a way that is democratic

342
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,700
and doesn't concentrate power in the hands

343
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,500
of maybe a small bureaucracy or some bureaucracy

344
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,180
that's unaccountable to the rest of humanity?

345
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,740
So we take this problem very seriously,

346
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,580
and I was sort of saying,

347
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,540
we have this idea of these total plans

348
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,340
where you might have a plan that involves

349
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,580
higher use of fossil fuels

350
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,780
with solar geoengineering to cool the climate,

351
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,100
and that would come with huge amounts of risks

352
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,980
and maybe many disasters caused,

353
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,500
but perhaps that would be the one that wins out

354
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,260
in our imagined parliament,

355
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,420
and the intro would just be unhappy in the opposition,

356
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,860
but that's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.

357
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,980
But the hope would be that we make a clear choice

358
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,900
about what's going on,

359
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,300
because right now we're fumbling blindly into the future.

360
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,020
People aren't aware of the trade-offs of decisions,

361
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,180
like having a massive animal industry

362
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,700
causes huge amounts of land to be used

363
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
in a very inefficient way,

364
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,820
burning down the Amazon to make new pastures for cattle.

365
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,900
It's not exactly a great planning choice,

366
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,900
and I think these things are talked about blindly

367
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,740
in an isolation, but when they're combined together

368
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,820
and the trade-offs are more apparent,

369
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,860
that's sort of when democracy can really begin

370
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,340
and when kind of a more sensible,

371
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,980
I don't know, control of the planet can start.

372
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,100
Before we get to the planning part,

373
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,020
and this will be, of course,

374
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,940
a big part of our conversation today,

375
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,420
before we get to the planning part,

376
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,340
maybe you could say some words about your position

377
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,940
towards epistemic groundings of this proposal

378
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,940
in terms of planning,

379
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,060
because I think what is very much relevant

380
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,540
for the whole concept that you propose

381
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,500
and relevant for also a lot of the questions I had

382
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,660
after reading the book is,

383
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,340
what information do you think we need,

384
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,180
and how much can we actually know?

385
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,620
Because in the book,

386
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,700
you make use of certain types of modeling.

387
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,460
You propose that we can use modern modeling technology

388
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,220
in terms of climate modeling.

389
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,340
We could repurpose it for questions of planning,

390
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,340
and also when it comes to the question

391
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,220
whether or not a maybe more decentralized version

392
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,620
of planning would be interesting or a central one,

393
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,020
again, the question of epistemic assumptions

394
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,980
about what knowledge can somebody have

395
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,380
and where can it be located comes up.

396
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,980
So I would be interested in what was the epistemic grounding

397
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,180
when you were thinking about how this planning procedure

398
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,020
could be sketched out.

399
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,460
So one of the foundations for the book

400
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,500
from the very beginning is this dialogue

401
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,140
with the neoliberals, with Hayek and von Mises.

402
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,420
And what the neoliberals use,

403
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,220
and Troy, you can jump in a little bit

404
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,380
and talk more about your favorite baddies,

405
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,260
but what the neoliberals say is basically

406
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,740
that markets are information collecting machines.

407
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,380
They're machines for information

408
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,100
where the price acts as a decentralized signal

409
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,420
that allows everyone to respond in concert to changes,

410
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,860
and they don't need to necessarily know

411
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,780
why the price is that,

412
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,380
but it allows them to make according plans.

413
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,940
And a big part of the idea here

414
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,460
is that human intervention in the market

415
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,020
will always be misguided

416
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,420
because the market is sort of beyond human.

417
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,380
It's a machine that is too complex

418
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,300
and important to mess with,

419
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,380
and therefore we should leave it alone

420
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,660
and let it go about its information business.

421
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,900
And we should add markets in as many places as we can,

422
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,780
even where there aren't markets already.

423
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
So it's an epistemic argument.

424
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,420
It's an argument that we can't know about the market.

425
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,260
And interestingly, they use a lot of natural metaphors,

426
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,820
biological metaphors to back up this claim.

427
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,220
So they use biology as a metaphor for the economy

428
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,380
rather than the neoclassical metaphor of physics

429
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,700
to understand making equations, right, to model the economy.

430
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,180
What we point out is that the obvious point

431
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,100
that if you're using nature as a metaphor

432
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,620
for how complex the economy is,

433
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,500
well, surely nature is more complicated than that.

434
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,460
And we talk a lot about how complex nature is

435
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,100
and how it evades attempts of management,

436
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,940
many attempts of management.

437
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,420
We talk about the ozone hole, right,

438
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,740
where the chlorofluorocarbons were used

439
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,020
to replace dangerous refrigerants.

440
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,340
And these were supposed to be completely non-reactive,

441
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,460
like all chemistry up to that point,

442
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,340
we're like, yeah, you know, these are tightly bound.

443
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,940
Nothing's gonna break these molecules apart.

444
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,620
It turns out that in this stratosphere

445
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,100
under certain conditions over Antarctica

446
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,460
and to some extent over the Arctic in the winter

447
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,660
and in the spring, you know,

448
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,540
you can get this breaking apart

449
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,700
and then you can get chlorine radical cycles

450
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,180
just completely eviscerate the ozone layer.

451
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,500
And we just got lucky with this.

452
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,740
We got lucky that it only destroyed

453
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,980
the ozone layer of Antarctica.

454
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,660
If the rate constants were different,

455
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
then maybe it would go all over.

456
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,820
So it was just lucky.

457
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,780
This was an intervention

458
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,420
that had all the kind of basis behind it,

459
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,940
all the kind of research behind it.

460
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,620
And so it's just kind of a lesson

461
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,020
that interventions into the environment are risky.

462
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
They, it's a very complex place.

463
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,780
We also use the metaphor biosphere two,

464
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,820
which was an attempt to make

465
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,020
an artificial closed ecosystem

466
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,740
with like an artificial coral reef,

467
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,900
a bunch of different biomes,

468
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,140
like in a little dome

469
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,380
and have some humans inside and be supported.

470
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,700
And it completely collapsed rather quickly

471
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,540
because of unintended consequences

472
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,460
like the concrete reacted with the oxygen

473
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,340
and they needed to pump in more oxygen

474
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
so people wouldn't die.

475
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Most of the species died

476
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,340
but the invasive cockroaches thrived.

477
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,900
It was a disaster.

478
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,700
And it's a lesson in how complex ecosystem services are.

479
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,020
So we point out that basically the question comes down to,

480
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,380
are you going to plan nature?

481
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,900
Basically, are you going to use geoengineering?

482
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Are you gonna, for example, spray sulfur

483
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,940
into the stratosphere to cool the planet

484
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,620
and make the world safe for markets

485
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,980
to continue to go about their business?

486
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,300
Or are you going to step in

487
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,620
and say that humans must plan our own activities,

488
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,620
the economy and not attempt to plan nature

489
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,780
more than a certain amount described maybe by a vote.

490
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,020
We obviously have to intervene in nature to like grow food

491
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,380
and to supply ourselves with the resources we need.

492
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,620
But we argue that we should set

493
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,300
some conscious limits there

494
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,820
so that we allow nature to have its continued functioning.

495
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,100
I definitely agree with what Drew said

496
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,020
and Drew can speak more about the technical aspects

497
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,460
of how do you relate a global plan

498
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,340
to a series of regional and local plans?

499
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,620
How do you use linear programming

500
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,700
to plan the future as well,

501
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,820
which is one thing Kantorovich worked on.

502
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,740
But what I'm gonna say is relating more

503
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,300
to this neoliberal question of what can be known.

504
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,260
And we can be engaged quite a bit with neoliberals

505
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,620
because we think they really raise an interesting point,

506
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,620
which is economics is where is a question of knowledge.

507
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,300
And we think socialists haven't dealt very well with this

508
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,220
or at some level, a lot of the market socialists

509
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,380
just say Mises was right and Noyrat was wrong.

510
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,500
And therefore, you need markets under socialism.

511
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,020
And we still think Noyrat's critique

512
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,140
of pseudo rationality holds true

513
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,340
where if you have markets based on some kind

514
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,060
of universal metric, this labor time, chits,

515
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,420
or is it energy or what have you,

516
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
it would eventually lead to irrational outcomes.

517
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,060
And the only way to rationally manage ourselves

518
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,100
as a species is to recognize

519
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,140
that they're incommensurate units.

520
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,740
And we have to judge the totality,

521
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,740
which is again, what Noyrat argues.

522
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,900
And we're not saying this is gonna be easy.

523
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,380
We're not saying that it's gonna work perfectly.

524
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,260
I mean, we get into Cornyn and this idea

525
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,940
that socialism leads towards shortage often.

526
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,180
And at some level, we're saying we have to make a choice

527
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,660
between do we want restraint and shortage

528
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,900
or do we want excess and disaster

529
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,540
and excesses that we don't want as well.

530
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,580
The other thing I would say is that I think it's true

531
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,580
at some level what socialists and neoliberals point out.

532
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,020
I mean, I think at some level it's true

533
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,940
that it's hard to make up for or compensate

534
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,900
for or replace tacit knowledge

535
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,580
as the person on the ground will have a better view

536
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,580
of things than the planner far away.

537
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,900
That is true, but there is also a value

538
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,260
to having an attempt to see the whole.

539
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,420
And the problems that we're facing now,

540
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,700
I think are better faced with the latter,

541
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,340
with attempts to grasp the whole

542
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,540
than with attempts from a point of view of a single person.

543
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,140
And that's the wager we're making.

544
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,700
That's very interesting.

545
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,380
And we will come back to this

546
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,220
because I have some follow-up questions

547
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,900
regarding exactly that.

548
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,180
But before we do so, I think it would be important

549
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,340
for listeners, for the audience to maybe take a step back

550
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,180
and like cautiously get into the planning stuff

551
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,340
because you argue actually for a synthesis

552
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,140
of different approaches, including,

553
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,700
as you already mentioned, in Natura calculation

554
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,780
as proposed by Otto Neurath.

555
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,740
But you also include Kantorowicz's linear programming,

556
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,940
cybernetics in the form

557
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,940
of Stafford Beer's viable systems model.

558
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,380
What elements from these different approaches

559
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,020
do you think should be incorporated

560
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,740
in contemporary eco-socialist planning?

561
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,860
And how does the resulting planning mechanism

562
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,900
actually look like?

563
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,820
Yeah, so to do a high-level overview,

564
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,540
the basic idea is to have,

565
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,100
we kind of imagined sort of roughly

566
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,620
that you would have some set of total plans,

567
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,340
so visions that are coherent for the future

568
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,660
that are then made available for a vote

569
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,020
and then are produced in turn also with lots of input

570
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,060
from people and various interests.

571
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,420
And so how you would devise these sort of,

572
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,820
you would call them maybe blueprints for the future.

573
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,180
And you might use many different methodologies

574
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,780
to produce such a blueprint.

575
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,500
One important historical algorithm

576
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,540
that is still very important today is linear programming,

577
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,060
which is a way of doing constrained optimization.

578
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,100
So if you have a set of constraints that you propose,

579
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,780
like we have only this many people working this many hours

580
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,220
and we need to produce these goods,

581
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,820
what's an optimal solution

582
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,460
or an optimal way of distributing this work?

583
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,820
And this is used all the time in corporate planning.

584
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,780
This is used all the time

585
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,100
in designing renewable energy systems.

586
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,820
It's a very commonly used algorithm,

587
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,500
but there are of course many other ways,

588
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,340
many other tools that one can use.

589
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,180
The idea is to make like kind of a rough draft,

590
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,500
no need to go into super deep detail

591
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,860
and it's not even probably possible,

592
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,940
but to give people an idea of like, okay,

593
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,300
if we have a high energy use future,

594
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,580
this is the sort of resources we'll need.

595
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,780
This is the amount of maybe mining labor,

596
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,660
this is the amount of XYZ

597
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,220
and these are the natural risks,

598
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,140
the risks of climate change,

599
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
the risks of geoengineering,

600
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,220
the risks of XYZ involved in this plan.

601
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,300
And then you might have another plan

602
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,340
that's more in line with what me and Troy are proposing.

603
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,380
So you give up a meat

604
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,780
and maybe there could be variations of how much meat

605
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,500
and animal products are given up.

606
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,900
And then you can talk about the benefits

607
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,340
and the sacrifices involved.

608
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,460
And then hopefully you come to a vote

609
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,420
and you come up with a particular path forward.

610
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,340
And then from there,

611
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,460
you have to go to day-to-day management.

612
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,300
And this is where we draw on more of the Stafford beer.

613
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,700
Yes, Troy.

614
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,940
I just wanted to point out

615
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,980
that Drew has already made a model,

616
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,060
a very basic linear programming model

617
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,140
with these constraints between energy use

618
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,500
and land use and extinction rate and all that.

619
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,540
And we use that in the book and we say,

620
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,260
okay, well, what if we want this quota for energy

621
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,380
or what if we want to protect this much land?

622
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,660
And then we test the constraints

623
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,620
and see if that plan is viable.

624
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,820
And again, this is a very basic model

625
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,980
but it's already more complex

626
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,140
than Nordhaus' DICE model, right?

627
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,100
And this is not hard to do,

628
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,340
to have like a very basic discussion about what's possible.

629
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,460
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

630
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,020
Very basic model, but the idea is basically being like,

631
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,820
okay, if you assume a certain amount of electrification,

632
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,540
how much, what would your energy mix look like?

633
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,660
That sort of thing.

634
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,860
But from there, you have to go to day-to-day management.

635
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,900
So we talk a little bit about the Cybersyn experiment

636
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,860
in Salvador Allende's democratic socialist experiment

637
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,380
in Chile in the early 1970s.

638
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,820
And the idea here was that the Allende government

639
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,780
was bringing in industries into the state controlled sector

640
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,340
and they needed to basically organize and plan

641
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,220
this rapidly growing sector of the economy.

642
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,620
And so some Chilean engineers brought in Stafford Beer

643
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,780
who was a British cybernetics person.

644
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,660
And Beer had this model that he had been working on,

645
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,540
this kind of management model that was hoping

646
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,740
to your earlier point,

647
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,940
try and balance the appropriate amount of centralization

648
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,900
to make sure that resources are being allocated sensibly

649
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,820
with enough decentralization

650
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,260
to prevent any irrational outcomes

651
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,460
or violations of the democratic socialist principles

652
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,860
that Allende's revolution was built on top of.

653
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,340
So both kind of making use of sort of tacit knowledge

654
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,420
of closer to a particular circumstance

655
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,620
and also preventing any unjust

656
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,060
or undenocratic bureaucracy from emerging.

657
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,380
And it's a lot of detail to get into,

658
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,340
but the basic idea of the viable systems model is there's,

659
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,620
you can kind of let say a factory manage itself

660
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,460
most of the time, kind of letting higher authorities know

661
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,060
its inputs and outputs.

662
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,500
Although Stafford Beer would hate me saying higher authority.

663
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,380
He considered this whole thing level,

664
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,380
but like letting a more central information managers

665
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,700
knowing inputs and outputs,

666
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,100
and then emergent skills could be bumped up

667
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,980
to higher levels of coordination.

668
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,020
And again, Stafford Beer would hate me saying higher,

669
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,020
but this proves its metal in a CIA backed strike

670
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,940
against the logistic sector, against the trucking sector.

671
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,940
So basically the entire transport of materials breaks down

672
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,700
in Chile and they had some loyal trucks left.

673
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,140
And the question was, how can we make sure everyone gets food

674
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,020
and how can we make sure that the economy

675
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,380
continues to function?

676
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,220
And this sort of system allowed basically people

677
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,940
on the ground to kind of almost in dialogue

678
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,460
with the center, direct resources in the most wise way.

679
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,020
So like mapping out where this truck should be driving.

680
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,740
So it was this very remarkable evenness

681
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,220
between kind of people out in the field

682
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,620
and people in the center where all this information

683
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,540
was kind of coming in and being distributed,

684
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,660
where these scarce resources are being allocated reasonably

685
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,940
and the country was able to make it

686
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,060
through the strike successfully.

687
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,660
So it's a really interesting kind of management experiment

688
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,900
that did use technology,

689
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,260
but not as much as I think it has a reputation for.

690
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,780
These were like primitive fax machines, right?

691
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,980
That was required.

692
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,580
The computer itself was important, but not hugely.

693
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,100
And then we bring in some more modern ways

694
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,300
of fusing information with modeling from climate science.

695
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,500
So climate science and weather are,

696
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,780
I think something that we should be talking about

697
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,380
because what the weather system is,

698
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,540
what the weather kind of prediction system is,

699
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,060
is a truly global system of information.

700
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,260
So we have weather models, which are models of physics,

701
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,340
but the weather system is chaotic.

702
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,260
People have heard of the butterfly effect, right?

703
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,380
Butterfly flaps and swings,

704
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,900
and then all of a sudden there's a hurricane.

705
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,260
And the basic idea is that if you have slight changes

706
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,460
in your initial conditions,

707
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,180
days later you have a totally different weather system.

708
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,740
It's a chaotic system.

709
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,340
So you need your initial conditions

710
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,180
to be as close to accurate as you can

711
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,980
so that your forecast is accurate.

712
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,700
And the reason why weather forecasts have improved

713
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,460
is because we have better initial conditions.

714
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,620
We have better initial conditions

715
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,820
because we have a global network of sensors, monitors,

716
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,900
and information.

717
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,060
We have satellites, we have buoys in the ocean,

718
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,580
we have ships, we have aircraft,

719
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,540
we have monitors on the surface.

720
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,180
In fact, during the COVID pandemic,

721
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,620
weather forecast got slightly worse

722
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,180
because you didn't have as many planes flying

723
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,260
and you didn't have that kind of mid-atmosphere input

724
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,700
into your weather model.

725
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,900
It's a truly global information system.

726
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,340
And the algorithms designed to run this system

727
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,020
views the sort of model of like

728
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,180
what you think should be going on with what's in the world.

729
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,900
And if there's divergence between what the model says

730
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,740
and what the world says,

731
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,940
there are optimal ways to combine those.

732
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,620
So if you have a plan for how the economy should work,

733
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,420
that plan will obviously fail because, you know,

734
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,940
things will not work out the way you assumed,

735
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,900
but it should be relatively accurate

736
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
because it is what the plan is.

737
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,140
And so you can update that plan on the basis of, say,

738
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,420
like a factory not receiving its steel shipments,

739
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,780
and you could maybe go in and see where the problem is

740
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,300
and be able to intervene in a way that's sensible,

741
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,780
but that also makes sure that autonomy is preserved

742
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,340
to as great of an extent as necessary,

743
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,660
but also make sure that everyone's working towards

744
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,220
common, coherent goals.

745
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,460
So it's a balancing approach.

746
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,060
And these are really remarkable algorithms.

747
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,540
I think there needs to be more conversation about them.

748
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,980
They're very powerful tools that are already being used

749
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,660
to do a form of global information management.

750
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,420
And I'm very sorry, Drew,

751
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,780
but I have to pick up on the question of higher authority

752
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,260
because you rightly point out

753
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,340
that I would be skeptical of this phrase,

754
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,980
but when I read specifically the narrative part

755
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,580
at the end of the book,

756
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:05,580
there is a sense of quote unquote higher authority

757
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,980
in terms of the like central planning board.

758
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,180
And as far as I understood it, at the end,

759
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,180
the model that you propose will end up in kind of calculating

760
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,500
optimal plan or the best variety of plans

761
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,780
that all try to be as efficient as possible

762
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,780
and then propose these plans to the public to decide over,

763
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,700
but then you will always come into the situation

764
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,860
where people will have to enact this plan.

765
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,380
And this might lead to a situation

766
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,940
where those people who will have to enact the plan

767
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,020
will perceive this plan as external from themselves,

768
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,980
depending on how much they were involved

769
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,900
in creating the plan, of course,

770
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,380
but still, at least for me,

771
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,700
when reading the narrative part at the end of the book,

772
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,740
there was a certain sense of this

773
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,140
like detached planning commission,

774
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,860
which seemed to be a bunch of experts, quote unquote,

775
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,340
that calculates this optimal plan

776
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,340
that we are now forced to bring into being into practice.

777
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,980
So there is this element of higher authority coupled to,

778
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,300
I would say the concept of central planning per se.

779
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,460
And I would be interested

780
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,380
how you conceptualize this in your model.

781
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,620
I got the feeling as if your main point would be,

782
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,420
it's urgent, we need to fucking do something.

783
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,860
This is the only way we can do it.

784
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,460
That's the kind of vibe I got more or less,

785
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,180
I have to be honest.

786
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,300
I mean, I'll start,

787
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,740
Drew is definitely the more the mathematical whiz

788
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,020
of the two of us by far.

789
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,660
But I think I just want to point out that,

790
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,220
what's nice about linear programming

791
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,420
is that the math, as Drew's saying, is not so complex.

792
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,940
So I think we imagine at some level

793
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,700
that everyone would be taking linear programming

794
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
in school and anyone could make a global plan

795
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,780
or anyone can use the modeling tools

796
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,500
that one puts out to make a plan

797
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,740
and one could make their own plans.

798
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,500
And this is the very Noiratian approach to socialism

799
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,540
where you are showing the working class

800
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,420
what the economy is, let them see it through isotype,

801
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,020
make it as visually easy to understand

802
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,700
and appealing as possible.

803
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,140
And they'll set up museums

804
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,220
and get hundreds of thousands of people

805
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,660
to see what the Austrian economy looks like.

806
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,460
And then you can imagine taking it over.

807
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,180
And I think with this kind of mathematics,

808
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,940
people would see a relation between their own work

809
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,180
and what kind of world they want.

810
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,740
And I think this is an important part

811
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,060
of what socialist democracy would be.

812
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,380
And that's not to say that people are always gonna get

813
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,900
the plans that they vote for,

814
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,180
but that they want, right?

815
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,420
But I think it would be one important way

816
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,300
to overcome maybe any kind of reluctance or disagreement.

817
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,300
I mean, again, humans are always gonna disagree.

818
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,460
I don't think that's going to go away,

819
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,060
but there's also a reason why it's important for us

820
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,100
to have a more nuanced relationship

821
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,020
between local and central planning.

822
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,860
And I think a lot of debates on the left

823
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,020
are just like, oh, we'll just have a tiny little communes

824
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,820
that are extremely inefficient,

825
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,020
but they'll be autonomous and that'll be fine.

826
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,980
Or we'll have some gigantic tanky solution,

827
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,140
like a super plan.

828
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,020
And I think what Kantorovich and Bjerg get into

829
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,900
is a much more nimble relationship.

830
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,900
It's important to have some things centralized

831
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,900
where you can, I guess, not efficient for everyone to make,

832
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,820
I don't know, their own high grade aluminum

833
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,860
or something like that.

834
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,460
It's better to do in some areas than others.

835
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,780
But we also want to,

836
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,660
we also will have problems with information.

837
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,980
That's why you will have a central plan

838
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,660
that is relatively vague,

839
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,100
and then you get down to finer detail the lower you go.

840
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,340
But of course, if a planning bureau

841
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,020
or the parliament that we imagine that we put in La Paz

842
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,300
votes to have mandatory veganism or something like that,

843
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,900
well, I'm sure lots of people won't like that,

844
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,100
no matter how strong the animal rights movement

845
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,020
has become by 2040 or whatever it is.

846
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,340
I mean, there still would be opposition,

847
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,700
but I think that's just what politics is.

848
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,260
And socialism would be at some level

849
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,700
of the politicization of everything

850
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,420
because that is what democratic control of the economy is.

851
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,780
I don't think we should be afraid of that.

852
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,660
And that's where I think market socialists

853
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,020
escape back to the market.

854
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,420
I think they come close to seeing what socialism looks like,

855
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,340
which is what Neuert tells us in 1919,

856
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,300
and then they withdraw because it's too terrifying,

857
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
it's too much conflict.

858
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,700
But I think this is a mistake.

859
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,140
Yeah, I think the environmental crisis

860
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,860
throws a wrench into a lot of things.

861
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,140
And I think it's just important to remember

862
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,580
how challenging the questions facing us are.

863
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,660
Like they're more challenging,

864
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,780
as we talked about earlier,

865
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,260
than the IPCC 1.5 degree report that's on

866
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,460
because that report assumes so much facts.

867
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,500
For example, this is an extremely hard problem,

868
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,500
making sure that the dream of socialism that I have

869
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,820
is that everyone on the earth has the resources

870
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,820
for a good life, there's equality,

871
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,780
everyone has the things they need,

872
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,620
and we have a planet that's able to sustain this.

873
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,460
That's a hard goal.

874
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,420
And it's a goal that requires coordination.

875
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,740
And we do try really hard in the book to make sure,

876
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,220
to emphasize how if this is not democratic,

877
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,780
it will fail, right?

878
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,060
There's no way that we imagine this working,

879
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,380
that the democracy is not just like a value,

880
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,780
it's just like a functioning.

881
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,700
Like if you're going to basically get rid

882
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,820
of the capitalist engine,

883
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,340
which is saying that if you don't work, you'll starve.

884
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,980
If you're getting rid of that,

885
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,980
then you're going to have to have buy-in,

886
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,900
and democracy is how you get buy-in.

887
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,900
So it has to be democratic to work.

888
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,020
I don't know if this is convincing to you.

889
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,860
Yeah.

890
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,420
No, no, but I would say your democracy part

891
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,060
is also important because Kantorovich comes up

892
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,860
with linear programming in the 30s,

893
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,460
and he talks to God's plan in the 40s,

894
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,460
and it doesn't go anywhere because God's plan

895
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,420
gets all its power from,

896
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,020
and let alone all the ministries and the government,

897
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,060
get their power from powers of distribution.

898
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,740
And if you had people voting on a plan,

899
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,140
and then people carrying out the plan,

900
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,420
that would take away this power from these ministries

901
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,660
or planning bureaus.

902
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,620
So therefore you needed democracy

903
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,220
to actually have linear programming.

904
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,660
That's why the Soviet Union never did it at scale,

905
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,460
because it would undo the power

906
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,100
of this authoritarian regime.

907
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,020
Well, but the way that the plans would come about

908
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,540
in your proposed scheme of things

909
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,860
is not through mere linear programming,

910
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,100
as you rightly state in the book.

911
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,100
This is maybe a tool for certain types of questions.

912
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,420
It might be useful,

913
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,420
but it is not that people could use linear programming

914
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,620
at home to make a plan on their own,

915
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,940
because the plans that the central planning board,

916
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,980
quote unquote, would produce

917
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,220
would have so much more components included in them,

918
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,620
from like high level modeling

919
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,620
that was repurposed from climate modeling,

920
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,740
to like data from, I guess,

921
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,620
billions and billions of sensors throughout the world,

922
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,380
and so on and so forth.

923
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,540
So it is not that people could,

924
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,220
through this playful participation,

925
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:27,220
really take part in this planning in a meaningful way.

926
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,260
So my question would be,

927
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,260
how is this interrelationship between central and decentral

928
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,260
really working out in concrete terms

929
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,100
when it comes to A,

930
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,420
the question of how these plans come about,

931
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,420
and B, how people are rightfully so perceiving it

932
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,380
as a democratic act of participation within this process?

933
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,860
So we finished this book a year ago, right?

934
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,180
Maybe even a little more.

935
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,020
But we've kept thinking about these issues

936
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,980
because you're pushing on the right pressure points here.

937
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,420
So we've been thinking about some other literatures

938
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,780
and thinking about some older papers and ideas

939
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,260
that revolve around this idea of iterative planning

940
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,900
or multi-level planning.

941
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,900
And the idea here is that you would have some rough draft

942
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,660
from the middle that might say something

943
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,460
like some rough estimates.

944
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,220
Then you kind of give that out to stakeholders.

945
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,340
And in the original papers,

946
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,380
this is not overly concerned with democracy,

947
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,020
but we would want it to be democratic.

948
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,940
So you give it to stakeholders,

949
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,740
you'd be like, okay, to this factory,

950
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,020
do you think this is a reasonable like kind of downscaling

951
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,460
what the implications of this plan would be?

952
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,700
Do you think this is reasonable?

953
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,220
Do you need more of X or more of Y?

954
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,660
Is this just way too much work?

955
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,500
Is this too much food to expect from this piece of land

956
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,460
given X amount of pesticides are going to be used

957
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,060
or not used, that sort of thing.

958
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,900
And then is this going to cause harm

959
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,420
to this environmental region or these practices here?

960
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,220
And then you get the feedback and then use that to refine

961
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,740
and then maybe you cohere the feedback in some way.

962
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,820
So try and make coherent these things

963
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,340
and produce a new kind of rough idea of the future.

964
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,500
You propagate back down, get more feedback.

965
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,860
And hopefully after a few cycles of this,

966
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,540
of these sets of inputs,

967
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,940
you would have a set of coherent plans

968
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,140
that are plausible at a local level.

969
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,660
And then of course, when the plans are enacted,

970
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,100
you would have of course,

971
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,100
wide leeway on a local level on how to enact them.

972
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,300
It would be that the sort of central goals

973
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,300
are much more about,

974
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,940
are we going to cross planetary boundaries

975
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,900
and are we going to make sure

976
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,980
that everyone gets the raw amount of energy

977
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,980
or food that they need for a good life?

978
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,500
Is there going to be enough grain production?

979
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,940
Is there going to be enough energy production

980
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,780
in the right ways?

981
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,980
Are our grids stable?

982
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,660
Is the key ecosystems being managed well

983
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,260
by whoever's managing them?

984
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,260
That sort of rough idea of things.

985
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,460
Then when the plan is enacted,

986
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,260
you would have a more local manager.

987
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,020
So that's how we've come to imagine

988
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,580
from more engagement with these questions,

989
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,020
how you might produce these plans

990
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,220
in a way that has more democratic input.

991
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,540
And there've been some experiments

992
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,460
with participatory planning out there.

993
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,140
They're often very short-lived or partial.

994
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,020
I think there's a way to make it work

995
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,940
that's necessary both for the construction of the plan,

996
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,140
a fair bit of information and input,

997
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,340
but also in making sure that there's democratic.

998
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,980
There was an experiment in Kerala, India

999
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,540
in the 1997 to 2002 five-year plan,

1000
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,780
which was basically an attempt to

1001
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,860
have these participatory planning meetings

1002
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,860
and hundreds of thousands of people got involved.

1003
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,460
The idea was to have this input go into the plan.

1004
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,340
The problem was that there wasn't,

1005
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,060
this sort of iterative process didn't happen.

1006
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,740
So you had a lot of great ideas

1007
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,260
that didn't quite get adhered into something cool.

1008
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,940
So there were some cool things about like pollination.

1009
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,820
Like some people knew about how pollination worked

1010
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,220
in their fields and they were able to get that incorporated.

1011
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,420
But it was more like tweaks rather than like a dialogue,

1012
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,380
which is what we would imagine being an ideal.

1013
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,620
So this is an inspiring experiment.

1014
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,300
But I mean, obviously you're pointing out

1015
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,860
this is a challenging problem, right?

1016
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,420
Like we don't feel this job, but like, yeah.

1017
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,700
True, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

1018
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,060
but I think the idea is you would have these

1019
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,940
linear programming models as a rough draft

1020
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,980
that people could examine and vote on and all that.

1021
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,300
And also the linear programming models would relate

1022
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,500
from like a central, like a global plan

1023
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,860
down to a regional and local plan in various ways.

1024
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,140
For example, if you vote globally,

1025
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,780
okay, everyone gets 2,000 Watts

1026
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,380
and they have 2,500 calories.

1027
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,660
And then like the region will say,

1028
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,220
okay, where are we going to get this energy from?

1029
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,700
And then make another plan and say, okay,

1030
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,180
it's more efficient getting it from solar versus wind

1031
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,340
and we'll put things here and there.

1032
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,340
And then you have that kind of relationship

1033
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,020
of being specific more and more

1034
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,220
as you go down to the local,

1035
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,100
but with parameters set by this larger model.

1036
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,500
But it's not like you just vote once on a plan

1037
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,860
and then you have the data assimilation,

1038
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,660
the cybernetics kind of run the plan for infinity.

1039
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,940
The way we're imagining is you would have a series of plan,

1040
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,100
maybe like a five-year plan or whatever timeline you want.

1041
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,500
And then people can say, go to parliament and say,

1042
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,620
okay, what are we going to do

1043
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,700
in the next five or 10 or 20 years?

1044
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,860
What are our plans for that?

1045
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,380
And that can be voted on.

1046
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,620
So I think the linear programming is a guide

1047
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,340
and the cybernetics is how you implement these things.

1048
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,820
But I don't think it's once you've allowed cybernetics

1049
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,300
to suddenly becomes undemocratic.

1050
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,020
It's just a tool.

1051
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,620
Well, I'm so sorry, but I have to disagree.

1052
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,460
Please, please.

1053
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,780
It's not just a tool.

1054
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,300
Yeah, I'm very sorry.

1055
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,300
Because I mean, I think at least two points within the book

1056
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,180
where this idea of just being a tool comes up

1057
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,940
with regard to linear programming.

1058
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,740
And now Troy, you just mentioned it

1059
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,780
with regard to cybernetics, but it is not just a tool.

1060
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,140
Let's take the case of cybernetics.

1061
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,860
It is founded on a functional equalization

1062
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,220
of humans and machines as information processing systems.

1063
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,420
And by looking at the situation from such a perspective,

1064
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,180
one will find very different solutions to problems

1065
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,300
compared to someone who looks at the problem

1066
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,340
informed by a different paradigm, so to speak.

1067
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:03,340
So these are not neutral tools or neutral theories,

1068
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,860
but they incorporate a certain perspective on things

1069
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,580
and that carries along certain assumptions

1070
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,100
about the things that are addressed within the models,

1071
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,060
so to speak.

1072
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,660
And I mean, at least as I understood it

1073
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,300
in the case of linear programming,

1074
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,700
the way that you build up your idea

1075
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,420
of synthesizing different approaches towards planning,

1076
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,020
as far as I read it, it more or less said,

1077
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,660
all right, we have this idea of linear programming.

1078
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,260
We have this as a mode of approaching certain problems

1079
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,020
where it might be adequate,

1080
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:48,020
but you cannot adapt to constant changes very well.

1081
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,460
And because of that, trying to approach planning

1082
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,180
merely through the perspective of linear programming

1083
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,220
is insufficient, and I would totally agree.

1084
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,060
And because of that, you go on to take a look

1085
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,540
at different other approaches, one of them being cybernetics.

1086
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:10,220
But that does also mean that what you just tried

1087
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,220
to describe, Troy, that we would all be kind of able

1088
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,220
to understand or maybe even reproduce this process

1089
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,660
would not be possible, because as I said before,

1090
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,420
linear program is just one piece

1091
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:32,260
within a very complex system of producing different plans

1092
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,740
that will then be decided upon.

1093
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,300
I'm not sure where this is leading me

1094
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,540
because it's not really a question,

1095
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:47,060
and I stated this before, it's just that I think for me,

1096
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:51,460
it was a bit difficult to get to grips

1097
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,620
with this directionality

1098
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:59,620
and this emphasis on a center that has at the end

1099
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,620
the knowledge that is needed in order to compute these plans,

1100
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,820
and because there are so many problems

1101
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,620
that go along with this, because it is also not innocent

1102
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,980
to have five or 10 or 50 or 100 plans,

1103
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,700
because by choosing, by pre-selecting the different plans,

1104
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,740
you already enact such a huge power,

1105
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,180
because you kind of present the field

1106
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,260
upon which the further game will be played,

1107
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,060
and this is such an immense power,

1108
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,060
and it is not that these are merely neutral technocrats

1109
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,300
that are just kind of doing this for the sake of humanity,

1110
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,500
even if they do, it would be problematic

1111
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,500
on epistemic grounds and on grounds of question of power

1112
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,100
and stuff like that.

1113
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,100
So I think I was kind of arguing with myself

1114
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:07,660
with this type of constellation between the individuals

1115
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,940
and the center, and then, of course, the question comes up,

1116
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,380
how do you get people to do this?

1117
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:20,380
If you have this plan, how do you get them to enact it?

1118
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,900
So if there are no monetary incentives,

1119
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,100
which I absolutely loved about the model,

1120
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,340
you do not want to force people into doing anything,

1121
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,260
and you want to give them a very high level

1122
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,660
of existential security,

1123
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,660
which I absolutely loved about the model,

1124
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,780
and this is absolutely right, the way you approach it,

1125
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,980
but there are so many questions that come up after,

1126
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,340
came up for me after reading this constellation,

1127
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,340
which for me, at least, kind of tended a bit too much

1128
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,660
in the direction of central planning,

1129
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,740
because I'm absolutely convinced as you are

1130
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,380
that both is needed.

1131
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,060
We do need central elements,

1132
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,460
we do need decentral elements,

1133
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:09,260
but from my kind of understanding,

1134
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,580
there were so many open questions

1135
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,900
after reading the proposal,

1136
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,820
and most of it came out of A,

1137
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,020
the high level of centrality,

1138
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,020
and B, like implicit assumptions about knowledge

1139
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,980
and where the knowledge can actually be

1140
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,380
brought together at the end.

1141
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,500
And this, yeah, this was just something

1142
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,300
I ended up with at the end.

1143
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,860
This is not really a question.

1144
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,620
Well, thank you for expressing this.

1145
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,620
This is a sort of an early stab, a first attempt here,

1146
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,780
and we don't claim that our modeling here,

1147
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,580
it's certainly not been the pause of our thought.

1148
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,220
We continue to think about these issues.

1149
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,820
We've continued to read new stuff,

1150
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,620
think new stuff, think about new models.

1151
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,620
So, I would really love to read more of other people's

1152
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,780
thinking about how we might build a non-monetary economy

1153
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,780
an economy that does manage to navigate

1154
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,980
the very difficult challenge of the environmental crisis

1155
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,740
and the amount of coordination that involves

1156
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:24,740
without the undesirable consequence of over-centralization

1157
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,900
or of our current system,

1158
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,300
which is complete and blindly walking into disaster

1159
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,860
that, and everyone is blind to the full picture

1160
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,460
or not everyone, but like that we're all making

1161
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,660
small decisions based on small incentives

1162
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,580
and it's creating a force that just leading us to ruin.

1163
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,340
So obviously we need a middle ground, right?

1164
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,860
How does that middle ground get constructed?

1165
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,340
And what we've tried to do,

1166
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,140
and so I guess I'll respond to a couple of the comments.

1167
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,820
So about technology never being neutral,

1168
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,540
this is of course true.

1169
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:06,540
And about technocracy never being neutral is of course true.

1170
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,940
True.

1171
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,140
What we tried to do is try and,

1172
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,380
but we also think that there needs to be some,

1173
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,220
I guess, administrative division of labor.

1174
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,020
We don't want everyone coming into meetings every day

1175
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,900
to plan things, I guess.

1176
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,420
So there's some amount of administrative division of labor.

1177
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,380
So we imagine still a parliament sort of system.

1178
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,940
So we have this sort of elected official sort of thing

1179
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,020
going on, which is already a compromise.

1180
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,460
We all know how representative democracy has its failings.

1181
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,820
And so there's all these compromises we're trying to make

1182
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,540
along the way to try and balance

1183
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,980
all these different tendencies.

1184
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,300
And that technology is never neutral,

1185
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,340
it's an important one, but that technology is,

1186
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,220
that the tools that we have developed

1187
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,860
to think about the world system,

1188
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,740
the earth system scientifically,

1189
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,740
seem to have promise in balancing environmental constraints

1190
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,900
is also there.

1191
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,860
And the question is, can we use this technology

1192
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:16,860
in a way that is democratic and is able to be just?

1193
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,980
I guess we're optimistic.

1194
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,900
Yeah.

1195
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,660
But I don't know, I'm sort of trailing off here, Troy.

1196
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,500
What do you want to say?

1197
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,340
Yeah, it's true.

1198
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,460
I think you can see too much.

1199
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,780
I mean, yeah, and I would push you to formulate

1200
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,900
your questions or your criticism more clearly.

1201
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,500
I mean, are you saying like, okay, no,

1202
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,980
there's no one mind with all the knowledge in the world.

1203
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,100
And I mean, it's kind of Hayekian argument.

1204
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,420
And you're like, okay, sure, I agree.

1205
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,340
But I mean, and this is why, again,

1206
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,460
we're talking about having these layered plans.

1207
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,220
Like the central planning, the global planning bureau

1208
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,060
will set fairly loose guidelines

1209
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,180
according to these planetary boundaries

1210
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,260
and orders boundaries for a good life.

1211
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,260
Like how many calories or energy does a person need?

1212
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,100
And then how to actually carry that out

1213
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,220
will be left up to regional and local government.

1214
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:16,220
And so I think there's that aspect.

1215
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,380
So I would agree with that,

1216
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,220
but we don't make this claim of having total knowledge.

1217
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,420
And then of course, technology isn't neutral.

1218
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,980
I mean, sure, but I also would say that cybernetics

1219
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,780
being some kind of like wicked military form of thinking

1220
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,380
is also a too simple critique.

1221
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,500
Not that I'm saying you're saying that,

1222
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,980
but some people are of course,

1223
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,140
are very skeptical of cybernetics for this reason.

1224
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,900
I mean, Beer was a huge hippie.

1225
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:48,380
Wiener himself was incredibly antagonistic

1226
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:52,100
to the military after the war as well.

1227
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,220
I mean, I think it's, and we're not proposing,

1228
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,780
yeah, merely, okay, we'll just see a bunch of experts

1229
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,620
to figure things out.

1230
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,100
That's not what we're saying.

1231
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,180
And again, we're trying to make this

1232
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,060
much more Noiratian point of you have to get

1233
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,300
as many people involved and as many people

1234
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,860
to understand what the economy is.

1235
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,380
And will that be perfect?

1236
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,300
Or will everyone have complete knowledge?

1237
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,180
No, but I think one should try.

1238
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,180
And then how exactly does one organize socialist democracy?

1239
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,660
Do we have referendums?

1240
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,300
Like, do we have a parliament?

1241
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,700
I mean, these are things we should be thinking about,

1242
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,980
but I think the alternative to say,

1243
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,260
oh, these things are too difficult.

1244
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,460
And therefore we have to do a market socialism

1245
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,300
and then rely on a market mechanism

1246
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,580
will not suffice to solve the problems we need to solve,

1247
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,700
which again, you know, mainly environmental problems.

1248
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,780
If we need to have us agree at the species,

1249
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,580
okay, we want to have only this much carbon emitted.

1250
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,660
We want to have only this much land deforested.

1251
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,580
If we want to stop climate change or the sixth extinction,

1252
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,260
if only part of us agree,

1253
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,980
then it doesn't really matter what the rest of us do.

1254
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,420
So I mean, again, maybe if you could reformulate

1255
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,980
what your critiques are, I'd be interested to hear it.

1256
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,100
Yes, absolutely.

1257
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,620
But first of all, I neither said that I think

1258
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:19,620
that cybernetics is just some form of military wishwash

1259
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,660
or anything as such.

1260
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
I just pointed out that it is not,

1261
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,900
that all these theories are not neutral in any way,

1262
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,940
but that they do imply some pre-assumptions

1263
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,260
that make a difference.

1264
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,700
I'm absolutely pro, including cybernetics,

1265
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,620
100% into our thinking.

1266
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,740
So I'm not actually stating that.

1267
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,100
Neither am I in any way, shape or form a market socialist.

1268
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,300
So if you pose it like either we do it your way

1269
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,220
or people are market socialists,

1270
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,420
then this is also an inadequate description

1271
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,380
of the situation between the three of us right now,

1272
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,980
because I'm not in favor of market socialism.

1273
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,460
So just to make that clear.

1274
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,900
And then maybe I can make it a bit more clear

1275
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,220
when it comes to the question of detail,

1276
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:09,220
because right now you stated that the central planning board

1277
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:14,340
would only kind of give out some like broad guidelines

1278
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,020
or something like that.

1279
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,820
And this would be something very different.

1280
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,980
And when I read the narrative part at the end of the book,

1281
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:27,980
and this is the part that maybe created this sense

1282
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,180
of over-centrality the most, I guess,

1283
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,500
there were some points within this narrative

1284
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,100
where people were like, all right, okay,

1285
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,020
because of the central board deciding

1286
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,420
that this labor should be allocated over there

1287
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,100
and people should do X, Y, that over there,

1288
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:54,980
we will now have to kind of try to enact it.

1289
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:57,260
And so there was a very clear sense

1290
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:01,700
of this directionality coming from the center

1291
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,420
in terms of the center has computed some kind of ideal plan.

1292
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:11,180
And I'm being polemic here a bit just to make the argument.

1293
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,540
There was this sense of there is this central board

1294
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,980
computing this ideal plan.

1295
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,980
And now we will have to find ways to enact it.

1296
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,940
And this kind of directionality is important, I think,

1297
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,380
because it will decide over the question

1298
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,860
whether or not people do experience

1299
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:35,700
democratic plant economies as democratic plant economies

1300
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,260
in terms of democratic in all caps,

1301
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:48,380
because this, as you rightly stated before, Drew,

1302
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,180
this is essential to actually making this work,

1303
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,140
because if they do not, and you do not have any types

1304
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,100
of monetary incentives or other forms of coercions,

1305
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,620
then this whole thing will not work out.

1306
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:07,580
To me, it seems as if the way it is set up right now,

1307
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:11,180
this form of over-centralization leads to a point

1308
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:16,180
where the plan maybe by being too detailed

1309
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,500
is first assuming epistemic aspects

1310
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,140
that I guess I would not share in terms of

1311
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,620
can this knowledge actually come together at this point?

1312
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,940
And Troy, you were rightly so,

1313
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,860
I think pointing towards tested knowledge

1314
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,380
and the question of how to handle this one.

1315
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,820
So this is the first one.

1316
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,820
And then if it is too detailed,

1317
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,500
and not only in the framework of like loose,

1318
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,780
not loose, but broad guidelines,

1319
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,820
you will come to a point where it will be experienced

1320
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,540
as external by the people who will have to enact it.

1321
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,180
Those are the two things.

1322
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,580
And this makes a very big difference,

1323
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,100
because if you, for example, look at models

1324
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,820
where questions of economic planning are handled

1325
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:09,820
through like prices for central categories of production,

1326
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:16,100
then you will have a very broad set of indicative prices

1327
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,140
that then kind of indirectly lead to a form

1328
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,700
of coordination within the system in a very loose way.

1329
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,460
But I had the sense that within the proposal

1330
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,180
that you are bringing forward,

1331
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:36,180
this type of detail in terms of what is planned

1332
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,660
and what is not planned and who is involved

1333
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:43,140
in which aspects of planning is a very different one.

1334
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,660
So I hope this is a little bit more clear.

1335
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,140
Yeah, no, this is nice.

1336
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:52,020
And this is actually, this is a really good place

1337
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,900
to be talking about the appropriate level of detail.

1338
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,900
And I definitely think that this is,

1339
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,380
I think the right area to be focusing on,

1340
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,900
what is the appropriate level of detail

1341
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,260
at each level of the plan, right?

1342
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,220
We're imagining some sort of kind of federative, right?

1343
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,020
Like structure right where that,

1344
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,860
and then the concreteness goes down.

1345
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:14,500
And I think what we're trying to get out with the narrative,

1346
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,140
and I think is insufficiently clear,

1347
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,820
is that the planning and sort of the central valley

1348
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,740
of Massachusetts would be done in terms of like,

1349
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,780
how many, like we have these factories

1350
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,540
and these farms here, here, and here,

1351
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,740
and how much labor is required for each.

1352
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,980
And then if someone puts in an application for work

1353
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,340
and they wanna live here,

1354
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,500
like these are the options to choose from.

1355
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,540
That level of detail would be at that kind of county

1356
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,980
to city level, I guess.

1357
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,180
And so this would not be set up by the US

1358
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,340
or the Eastern US or the North America

1359
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,020
or the global level, right?

1360
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,580
It would be more like we need,

1361
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:56,900
we think we want some vegetables, right?

1362
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,620
And then we can grow some amount here, right?

1363
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,380
But that was sort of what we were going for.

1364
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,020
So we don't imagine that that,

1365
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,060
we imagine that that detail is more local.

1366
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,260
From there, we can have a conversation

1367
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,860
about whether that's too much or too little detail.

1368
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,220
And I think that would be a really,

1369
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,740
that's the sort of, I think,

1370
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,460
really nice conversation that I would love to have

1371
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,380
in this sort of discussions of how we might do planning.

1372
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,220
And the question of,

1373
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,980
do you, quantities, do you do indicative prices?

1374
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,820
Do you do, what is your mechanism for doing this?

1375
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,380
We've been talking about sort of in the Torah units.

1376
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,220
So like, we, I guess, have been leaning more

1377
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:38,540
on the sort of quota such quantity side of planning,

1378
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,820
but perhaps there could be a case

1379
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:43,060
that in for playing certain aspects of things,

1380
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,420
an indicative price and then allowing things to do this

1381
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,460
in some controlled way might be a reasonable way

1382
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,060
of doing local planning or something like this.

1383
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:53,620
I think we kind of intentionally leave it a little vague

1384
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,020
about how these plans are carried out.

1385
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,100
So I think,

1386
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,820
I don't actually think we disagree very much,

1387
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,660
which is of course a classic thing for me to say,

1388
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,140
but I think, I don't actually think we,

1389
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:06,500
I think this is the sort of detail

1390
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,220
that we kind of didn't flush out too much in the book,

1391
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,460
maybe to our own detriment.

1392
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:13,460
The book is quite short, just for listeners to know.

1393
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,980
We cover a lot of ground at a very high level,

1394
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,940
which might get us in trouble.

1395
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,820
But I think,

1396
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,100
I think that this is a good conversation.

1397
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,420
I would be nice to build up a more detailed model

1398
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,620
to like answer all these questions

1399
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,820
and try and think about like,

1400
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:27,940
what the right level of detail is,

1401
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,820
what planning tools might be used at different levels?

1402
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,140
What is the appropriate level of detail at different levels

1403
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,540
in terms of both information gathering

1404
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,460
and in terms of both experiencing it

1405
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,980
as a non-coercive system?

1406
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,460
I don't know if that was coherent,

1407
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,820
but those are my thoughts to what you just said.

1408
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:47,580
Yes, and I mean, I just want to point out

1409
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,140
that there were a couple of things

1410
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,500
that I really liked about reading all of this.

1411
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,460
So that it's not that I was reading

1412
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,460
and it was constantly thinking,

1413
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:01,460
oh my God, this is too authoritarian central planning.

1414
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,860
There were quite some elements that I really enjoyed.

1415
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,500
For example, this whole engagement

1416
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,260
with the question of modeling

1417
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:14,500
and how this could be a nested way of modeling

1418
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,180
in order to kind of avoid this idea

1419
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:22,220
of just having one central point

1420
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,180
where the data comes together.

1421
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,620
Because as you state in the book,

1422
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:29,740
in the case of climate modeling and weather modeling,

1423
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,380
this could never be accurate

1424
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:36,340
because you will have to have a form of nested approach

1425
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,500
in order to get to a point

1426
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:43,500
where you will be able to more or less get a picture

1427
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:48,100
and an idea of a very, very dynamic system

1428
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,780
that you are trying to get an idea of.

1429
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,540
So I thought this was really interesting

1430
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,860
and I immediately thought,

1431
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,340
okay, well, this would be interesting

1432
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,180
to get into contact with some people

1433
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,340
who are actually doing this

1434
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:06,860
and how this could be then re-appropriated

1435
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:11,860
to kind of use this Neurethian innatura approach

1436
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:16,500
that you obviously like very much.

1437
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,860
And since this was a really big question mark for me,

1438
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:25,860
how would this innatura calculation actually look like?

1439
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:30,860
I didn't really immediately had an inner image or idea

1440
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,060
how this would be approached in concrete terms

1441
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,140
because of course there are so many things

1442
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:40,100
that a modern economy is made up of

1443
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,660
that comparing everything innatura, of course,

1444
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:48,260
kind of brings you in a difficult spot as well.

1445
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,300
And since I was very much interested

1446
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,380
in how to approach actual innatura calculation

1447
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,420
in modern economies, and on the other hand,

1448
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,100
you were pointing towards these types of modern modeling,

1449
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:03,580
I was very much intrigued in how this would go about

1450
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,420
or how do you think about this pair

1451
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,100
which I was perceiving as an interesting fit actually.

1452
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,500
I suppose like the next step for this kind of project

1453
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,980
would be to think more seriously

1454
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,740
about making like a world model, right?

1455
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:24,740
And then, or work with people on regional or local model.

1456
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,780
Let's just assume the global model says this,

1457
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:33,340
and how would, let's say, Austria figure it out

1458
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,620
and what would Vienna look like based on those constraints

1459
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,100
and kind of work it out.

1460
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,660
I think this is, again, the Neurathian part

1461
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:44,060
where socialism is imagining these features

1462
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,180
and having discussions about how we should live.

1463
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:52,380
But you're right where I think the innatura

1464
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:58,140
parts of the plan would have to be a different radiance

1465
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:00,220
of detail, and I think,

1466
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,700
and I can imagine, you would just say,

1467
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,260
like how large is the chemical industry

1468
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:12,180
or how many fertilizer or pesticides do you want?

1469
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,220
And then, as in you could have some kind of way

1470
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,460
to group that, but then there would also be a way

1471
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,540
to zero in and say, okay, what does that look like

1472
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:25,060
in terms of phosphorus versus ammonia and so forth, right?

1473
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,060
And I think you want to have enough,

1474
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,420
less detail to look at these things in total,

1475
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,260
which again, we try to get into the book

1476
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,340
because we want people to really engage

1477
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:37,700
with these questions of energy and land use

1478
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,140
and the kind of nature we want.

1479
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:44,140
And then one can zero in if they want.

1480
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:49,620
Great, so at the end of every interview,

1481
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,220
I ask my guests, if you think about the future,

1482
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,900
what makes you joyful?

1483
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:00,100
I think writing this book has been a joyful experience

1484
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:04,620
because at some level, I think it's possible for us

1485
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,220
to overcome the environmental crisis

1486
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,020
and to overcome capitalism

1487
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,940
and to ensure the good life for all

1488
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,580
without sliding into some horrible dictatorship.

1489
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:18,460
I think it's not beyond humanity at some level.

1490
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:22,820
And we just want to convince more people

1491
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:23,860
that this is the case,

1492
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,380
because otherwise there's too much doom and gloom.

1493
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,220
Yeah, I think in writing this book,

1494
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,260
we've encountered people who are thinking very hard

1495
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,860
about issues like the practical details

1496
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,260
of transcending capitalism

1497
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,220
rather than simply critiquing, critiquing, critiquing.

1498
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:44,020
It's easy to critique, but as soon as you offer something,

1499
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,980
then people can come after you,

1500
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:48,300
which is good because it helps us refine our ideas.

1501
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,380
But it's being introduced to all these people

1502
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,740
thinking about these issues has been really, really wonderful.

1503
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:58,460
And it makes me very excited that we can hammer out

1504
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,380
the details in an appropriate way

1505
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:04,420
that we are able to walk these many tight ropes

1506
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:07,620
that we'll need to walk to build the future we all want.

1507
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,100
Great, and I hope you didn't get the sense

1508
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,020
that I was coming after you because I wasn't.

1509
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,780
I really enjoyed that you were putting out

1510
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,940
this concrete ideas on how things could be approached

1511
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,420
because I absolutely agree that we do need more

1512
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,740
of this type of engagement

1513
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:31,180
with how things could actually be done differently.

1514
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:37,020
No, no, I mean, this Think Tank podcast is amazing

1515
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,300
because there aren't that many that really get

1516
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,860
into the nitty-gritty of planning theory.

1517
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:46,180
And it's been a real joy to listen to your podcast

1518
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,340
and to have a place where we can really get into the weeds

1519
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,540
of some of the more obscure stuff in the book

1520
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:57,220
because not everyone wants to talk about Soviet mathematics.

1521
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:00,100
So thanks so much for having us.

1522
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,220
Thank you too.

1523
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,180
Yeah, this was really great.

1524
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,860
Yeah, it would be wonderful to talk even more

1525
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:10,620
and think more and maybe we have this iterative democracy

1526
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,980
thing for a Philip Dapricks conference

1527
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,300
in late June, early July.

1528
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,820
So maybe we could get more feedback there.

1529
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,620
So, I mean, we're still working and thinking.

1530
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,820
So, I mean, hopefully we can continue to talk

1531
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,460
and develop ideas.

1532
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,300
Perfect.

1533
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,420
