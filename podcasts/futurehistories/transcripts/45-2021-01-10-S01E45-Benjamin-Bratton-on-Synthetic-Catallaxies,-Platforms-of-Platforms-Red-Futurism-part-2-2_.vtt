00:00.560 --> 00:01.940
Welcome to Future Histories.

00:01.940 --> 00:05.360
My name is Jan Gross, and what you are about to hear today

00:05.360 --> 00:07.680
is the second part of an interview I did

00:07.680 --> 00:11.360
with Benjamin Bratton in the context of a guest lecture

00:11.360 --> 00:13.080
that I was invited to hold

00:13.080 --> 00:16.200
at the Goldsmiths College in London.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.440
Before we start, I want to thank Carmen, Florian,

00:19.440 --> 00:22.800
and David for their kind donations.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.560
But now please enjoy the second part of the interview

00:26.560 --> 00:30.440
with Benjamin Bratton on Synthetic Catalaxy's

00:30.440 --> 00:34.680
Platforms of Platforms and Red Futurism.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.600
With more than one of my guests, I have hit a wall

00:42.600 --> 00:45.400
when asking how post-human political constellations

00:45.400 --> 00:46.920
could actually look like.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.660
Your writing and thinking, as we just experienced,

00:49.660 --> 00:51.420
is very illuminating in that regard,

00:51.420 --> 00:53.740
and it absolutely confirms my suspicion

00:53.900 --> 00:56.740
that the idea of the individual in the strict sense

00:56.740 --> 00:59.180
needs to be overcome in order to really get

00:59.180 --> 01:02.720
to fundamentally different sociopolitical arrangements.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.180
You advocate for the disindividuation of the user position.

01:06.180 --> 01:08.220
Could you explain what you mean by that?

01:09.480 --> 01:10.320
Sure.

01:11.660 --> 01:14.700
So this also goes back to the interface layer discussion

01:14.700 --> 01:18.060
that we had about the ways in which the interface layer

01:18.060 --> 01:22.860
can be, is a kind of map, operates as a kind of map

01:22.860 --> 01:24.480
of the way in which the system works.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.060
And I don't mean to, it sounds abstract,

01:27.060 --> 01:30.340
but I mean it, again, just to remind your listeners

01:30.340 --> 01:32.460
in this very simple sense of,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.260
there's lots of things you can do with your computer,

01:34.260 --> 01:37.500
but the graphical user interface presents you trillions

01:37.500 --> 01:40.300
of things you could do, build a bomb, do whatever.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.020
But the graphical user interface presents you

01:43.020 --> 01:46.880
with this mechanism of several dozen menu options

01:46.880 --> 01:48.740
that you sort of pick and choose.

01:48.740 --> 01:53.740
So it's, part of it is that in this,

01:53.780 --> 01:57.460
a little bit has to do with the history of interface design,

01:57.460 --> 02:02.460
there is a presumption that is built into

02:04.140 --> 02:06.420
the interface structure that we're talking of,

02:06.420 --> 02:10.540
that the way in which the system should present itself

02:10.540 --> 02:15.540
to human users is one human user at a time.

02:15.700 --> 02:20.060
That the fact that our culture of interface design

02:20.060 --> 02:23.240
is built around this sort of individuated,

02:23.240 --> 02:27.220
psychologized, single-serving homo sapien user,

02:28.100 --> 02:31.980
separated from other single-serving homo sapien users

02:31.980 --> 02:34.500
in and of itself is not,

02:34.500 --> 02:39.240
is not, we take it as a highly naturalized condition,

02:39.240 --> 02:41.520
but it's not necessarily,

02:42.460 --> 02:45.020
it's not necessarily historically,

02:45.940 --> 02:50.400
it's a highly contingent kind of arrangement.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.020
We have lots of interfaces that are meant for plural,

02:54.020 --> 02:57.140
a plurality of users, like traffic signals.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.300
A traffic signal is an interface system

02:59.300 --> 03:01.580
that doesn't make any sense for one user,

03:01.580 --> 03:03.460
I mean, for users at a time.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.580
The whole thing, like it's green light for me

03:05.580 --> 03:07.540
because it's red light for you and yellow,

03:07.540 --> 03:11.180
and something that we all recognize that the way

03:11.180 --> 03:13.420
in which the street interface is presented to me

03:13.420 --> 03:15.580
is conditional in relationship to other users.

03:15.580 --> 03:20.580
And we are, once you sort of, when it's green light for me,

03:21.460 --> 03:23.460
I am a green light user of the street

03:23.460 --> 03:25.340
and you are a red light user of the street.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.300
And therefore I know what you're going to do

03:27.300 --> 03:29.300
because you're a red light user.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.340
And we're all in a way interpolated through this interface

03:33.340 --> 03:37.020
as being red light, green light drivers in this sort of way.

03:37.020 --> 03:40.340
But also we understand and can negotiate the relationship

03:40.340 --> 03:43.140
with each other in this differential.

03:43.780 --> 03:44.620
If it's made clear.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.180
So the traffic again is a kind of simple example

03:47.180 --> 03:50.460
of what a plural interface would be.

03:50.460 --> 03:55.100
Now, in a stupid sense, Facebook attempted to make,

03:56.300 --> 03:58.620
in a way attempted in social network software,

03:58.620 --> 04:01.140
attempts to make interfaces

04:01.140 --> 04:03.540
that are meant for pluralities of users,

04:04.620 --> 04:07.740
but do so in a way that I think are actually,

04:07.740 --> 04:11.860
that actually concretizes and refortifies

04:12.420 --> 04:15.700
the fiction of the autonomous individual

04:15.700 --> 04:17.940
in relationship to those, in relation to the kind of thing.

04:17.940 --> 04:21.220
It produces a subjectivity.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.100
And in our society, as I mentioned,

04:23.100 --> 04:26.020
subjectivity and agency are utterly conflated.

04:26.020 --> 04:29.540
And within the kinds of interpolations of the user

04:29.540 --> 04:31.220
that you see in social media software,

04:31.220 --> 04:33.580
that this conflation is not only re-emphasized,

04:33.580 --> 04:38.580
but there's a construction of a social subjectivity,

04:38.580 --> 04:43.460
of a social subjectivity of this individuated user

04:43.460 --> 04:46.540
as this kind of encaps, self-encapsulated,

04:48.660 --> 04:52.300
sort of piloting creature of its own data

04:52.300 --> 04:56.420
and its own presentation of self-identity

04:56.420 --> 04:58.700
in relationship to this.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.700
One of the arguments that I sometimes make,

05:02.700 --> 05:07.380
find myself making arguments against the,

05:07.380 --> 05:11.900
making arguments against those whose primary concern

05:11.900 --> 05:14.340
with the social function of planetary's computation

05:14.340 --> 05:16.300
is in terms of surveillance.

05:17.940 --> 05:21.100
And the argument that I make is basically twofold.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.620
One is that,

05:26.900 --> 05:28.260
one is ultimately,

05:28.260 --> 05:30.260
I mean ultimately comes down to the term surveillance

05:30.260 --> 05:32.060
has been overinflated to describe

05:32.060 --> 05:34.500
so many different kinds of ways in which we would sense

05:34.500 --> 05:36.540
and model and construct images of the world,

05:36.540 --> 05:38.060
that it's beginning,

05:38.060 --> 05:39.540
that we have a kind of a surveillance,

05:39.540 --> 05:41.300
anti-surveillance bubble.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.980
That climate science and the way in which we would sense

05:43.980 --> 05:45.180
and model and structure the world

05:45.180 --> 05:47.260
is also a giant surveillance regime,

05:47.260 --> 05:49.020
if you really want to think about it this way.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.300
But the key point in relationship

05:51.300 --> 05:52.660
to what we're discussing is

05:54.100 --> 05:56.580
using planetary scale computation

05:56.580 --> 05:59.220
for the sensing, modeling and prediction

05:59.220 --> 06:01.940
of what individual homo sapiens

06:01.940 --> 06:05.140
are likely to wanna look at next and click on next

06:05.180 --> 06:07.620
in which kind of video or funny picture

06:07.620 --> 06:09.260
they're gonna wanna see next

06:09.260 --> 06:14.260
is incredibly tragic misuse

06:14.540 --> 06:16.740
of planetary scale computation as a whole.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.820
It goes deeper than the fact

06:21.820 --> 06:23.620
that these people are being surveilled, right?

06:23.620 --> 06:27.020
And so you think of the Shoshana Zuboff kind of critique.

06:27.020 --> 06:31.340
The problem is not just that you have these individual people

06:31.340 --> 06:34.180
are constructed and are being observed and tracked

06:34.180 --> 06:35.540
and surveilled and manipulated

06:35.540 --> 06:36.660
by these large scale platforms.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.660
This is a problem.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.220
This is a tragic misuse of the apparatus.

06:40.220 --> 06:43.740
The deeper problem is that society is,

06:43.740 --> 06:46.340
is it through this individuated interpolation

06:46.340 --> 06:48.500
of the user as the user as this figure

06:49.540 --> 06:52.900
is that society is being defined and constructed

06:52.900 --> 06:57.620
as the aggregation of these atomic individual subject,

06:57.620 --> 07:00.780
agent, actors in the first place.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.420
It's a misrecognition of what a society is.

07:04.420 --> 07:08.420
It's a misorganization of how it is that the relations

07:08.420 --> 07:12.940
between a social species such as humans is constructed.

07:12.940 --> 07:17.420
It is absolutely 100% predicated, I believe,

07:17.420 --> 07:22.420
upon the kind of self-congratulatory self-atomizing logics

07:25.460 --> 07:29.460
of liberal individualism and legal subjectivity,

07:29.460 --> 07:32.700
which of course is why someone like Shoshana Zuboff

07:32.700 --> 07:34.700
can't make this critique at that level

07:34.700 --> 07:39.700
because as someone from the world of the law,

07:40.340 --> 07:44.700
this formulation of society as an aggregation

07:44.700 --> 07:47.100
of self-transparent and self-sufficient

07:47.100 --> 07:50.780
atomic liberal individualisms is a sacred concept.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.980
And so the only thing that she's able to do is to say

07:54.980 --> 07:59.100
that these sovereign individuals have been

07:59.540 --> 08:04.540
manipulated into forming improper contractual relationships

08:05.940 --> 08:07.020
with these institutions,

08:07.020 --> 08:10.020
these manipulated contractual relationships,

08:10.020 --> 08:15.020
and that we need to resolve this jurisprudence

08:19.180 --> 08:21.180
to make these contractual relationships

08:21.180 --> 08:23.500
between these sovereign individuals and these platforms,

08:23.500 --> 08:25.740
in fact, more fair and more transparent.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.420
And I'm arguing is that, no,

08:27.420 --> 08:29.820
it's this hyper-individuation of society

08:29.820 --> 08:31.260
through that usually that's the problem

08:31.260 --> 08:33.300
and that's a much deeper problem.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.820
This is something I think that Ghani and I also agree on,

08:35.820 --> 08:37.860
I think, in terms of some of the things

08:37.860 --> 08:39.060
that he's written about Zuboff.

08:39.060 --> 08:43.500
I think it's that we probably have a common interest

08:43.500 --> 08:48.500
and common point about that as well.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.580
So part of the question then,

08:52.580 --> 08:55.300
to your question of this multiplication of the user layer

08:55.300 --> 08:56.140
here has to go with,

08:56.140 --> 09:00.900
is also an understanding of ways in which we can learn

09:00.900 --> 09:03.180
to think about our subjectivity and our agency

09:03.180 --> 09:04.580
in relationship to these systems

09:04.580 --> 09:09.100
that is not through this lens of this kind of figure.

09:09.100 --> 09:13.580
Now, the other thing I should say is two points on this,

09:13.580 --> 09:16.940
I think, examples that I think will kind of specify

09:16.940 --> 09:19.180
what I mean as possible alternatives here.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.500
One is, and I just finished this book on the pandemic,

09:24.500 --> 09:25.940
which I just wrote for Verso,

09:25.940 --> 09:28.140
which will be coming out in June.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.260
It's a book called The Revenge of the Real,

09:30.260 --> 09:32.460
post-pandemic politics.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.380
And one of the things I talk about in this book

09:34.380 --> 09:37.300
is what I call the epidemiological mode of society.

09:37.300 --> 09:41.020
That is one of the things that we learned from the pandemic

09:41.020 --> 09:45.860
was to see society the way epidemiologists see society.

09:45.860 --> 09:48.100
Epidemiologists don't see society

09:48.100 --> 09:53.100
as a bunch of atomic monads

09:54.620 --> 09:56.500
that happen to once in a while

09:56.500 --> 09:59.500
enter into contractual relationships with one another.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.620
They see society as a kind of landscape of organisms,

10:03.620 --> 10:06.020
each of which is a medium

10:06.020 --> 10:08.140
for the transmission towards one or the other.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.700
But they see it in terms of a kind of

10:10.700 --> 10:13.900
aggregate biological population scale

10:13.900 --> 10:16.940
that indeed is, I think, a good lesson for us to learn.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.740
It's a conceptualization of society

10:21.740 --> 10:23.380
that we should bring forward with us

10:23.380 --> 10:26.220
into a post-pandemic world,

10:26.220 --> 10:29.820
and I think is one that is more accurate,

10:29.820 --> 10:32.620
more social, and more viable

10:32.620 --> 10:37.620
than the kind of atomic individual version of this.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.260
The other point in terms of the plurality of interfaces,

10:40.260 --> 10:42.380
part of the longer term, what now,

10:42.380 --> 10:44.340
what should we do next question is,

10:45.580 --> 10:47.580
it's not enough to take back our data,

10:48.900 --> 10:51.020
because the data that we would be taking back

10:51.060 --> 10:52.500
is not the data we need.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.300
Because something like Facebook,

10:56.300 --> 10:58.060
and this is also where Zuboff and I

10:58.060 --> 11:00.420
would depart from each other,

11:00.420 --> 11:02.460
it's not enough that Facebook,

11:02.460 --> 11:05.980
because Facebook has mismodeled society so tragically,

11:05.980 --> 11:08.820
that its model of society as this aggregation

11:08.820 --> 11:12.820
of acquisitive atomic individuals

11:12.820 --> 11:16.180
is such an inaccurate model of society,

11:16.180 --> 11:20.140
that I could say, here you go, you got it all.

11:20.300 --> 11:24.220
Here is all of the information on all of the Facebook users,

11:24.220 --> 11:26.660
all four and a half billion of them or whatever,

11:26.660 --> 11:29.140
all the likes and all the cat videos

11:29.140 --> 11:32.020
and all the conspiracy memes and all the rest of this.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.860
Here it is, you have it.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.300
The government of whatever, EU, take it all.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.140
You've got it.

11:38.140 --> 11:41.060
Now use this to solve climate change.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.580
Go.

11:42.580 --> 11:44.860
You can't, it's the wrong data.

11:44.860 --> 11:49.860
Data about what it is about this model of society

11:50.460 --> 11:52.860
is not the data that we need.

11:52.860 --> 11:54.860
And this is kind of the other,

11:54.860 --> 11:58.860
so taking it back from Facebook is useless.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.100
What we need is to produce the right data.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.580
What we need is to actually understand

12:03.580 --> 12:05.620
what data would we need

12:05.620 --> 12:08.060
in order to actually enter in these transformations.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.580
And so simply think is that to simply,

12:10.580 --> 12:14.620
again, to reclaim the property of the data

12:14.620 --> 12:17.300
that Facebook has produced about us

12:17.300 --> 12:22.060
isn't enough because in essence it's the wrong data.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.940
So anyway, those are some thoughts on this question

12:23.940 --> 12:27.820
about the user position, the necessity for its plurality,

12:27.820 --> 12:29.660
the problems of its over-individuation

12:29.660 --> 12:32.660
and where my thinking sort of aligns and differentiates

12:32.660 --> 12:35.660
from some other people who have thought about it.

12:35.660 --> 12:36.740
Super interesting.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.500
And I will skip the question on the UBI,

12:39.500 --> 12:42.220
which would be a kind of riddle

12:42.220 --> 12:44.620
on how to actually apply it on.

12:44.660 --> 12:47.340
I can say something real quick about it if you like.

12:47.340 --> 12:50.300
So because it connects with the catalaxy idea.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.140
Part of, I think the more convincing argument

12:52.140 --> 12:53.540
about universal basic income

12:53.540 --> 12:55.940
also has to do with a kind of distortion.

12:56.940 --> 13:00.260
And I think it's a distortion in the value

13:00.260 --> 13:03.620
that society gets from its own participants,

13:04.900 --> 13:06.740
that there is a distortion in this.

13:06.740 --> 13:09.300
And I don't know if you call it a price distortion.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.900
I think that might be a bit awkward,

13:10.900 --> 13:14.340
but it is a distortion of value at the very least.

13:14.340 --> 13:19.340
When you have a comp lit PhD making coffee

13:20.140 --> 13:23.660
because that's the best job that she can get,

13:23.660 --> 13:28.500
even though the contributions that she could make to society

13:28.500 --> 13:33.500
are so much greater than the provision of cups of coffee,

13:34.500 --> 13:36.020
there's a distortion at work.

13:36.020 --> 13:40.220
Or when you have a genius,

13:40.220 --> 13:45.220
some genius kid doing other kinds of menial work

13:45.660 --> 13:48.140
because they need to support themselves,

13:48.140 --> 13:51.740
because the provision of basic food, shelter,

13:51.740 --> 13:55.740
healthcare or whatever is only available to them

13:55.740 --> 14:00.740
because they are trading most of their working hours

14:01.020 --> 14:03.540
for the provision of these basic things.

14:03.540 --> 14:07.180
Society as a whole is not getting from them

14:07.180 --> 14:09.340
what we should be getting from them.

14:09.340 --> 14:14.340
That there is an entire second economy worth of value

14:16.780 --> 14:21.660
that is being suppressed by the under participation

14:21.660 --> 14:26.180
of people doing things that are trivial

14:26.180 --> 14:30.740
compared to their real talents and capacities to contribute.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.460
And so I see this in some ways,

14:32.460 --> 14:35.420
you could see this in a way as a distortion

14:36.060 --> 14:40.220
of social value that is much greater

14:40.220 --> 14:41.660
than anything high equity side

14:41.660 --> 14:43.340
with the socialist pricing problem

14:43.340 --> 14:45.340
of how much the bananas should cost.

14:46.340 --> 14:49.700
This is trivial compared to what we're missing out

14:49.700 --> 14:52.980
from a lifetime of work of people doing something

14:52.980 --> 14:56.460
that quite easily could be done by machine

14:57.340 --> 15:00.460
if we were allowing them to do so.

15:00.460 --> 15:04.420
And I think when I think about the long-term value

15:04.420 --> 15:07.300
of something like UBI in terms of how to measure this,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.660
how to price it or kind of something like this,

15:11.580 --> 15:13.420
this is the sort of the bigger picture

15:13.420 --> 15:16.020
that I'm trying to keep in mind

15:16.020 --> 15:19.180
is not having to do with does it cost more or less

15:19.180 --> 15:21.540
than some other kind of welfare policy?

15:21.540 --> 15:22.700
Does it cost more or less

15:22.700 --> 15:23.980
in the relationship of this as well?

15:23.980 --> 15:26.180
But rather that in the long-term,

15:26.180 --> 15:28.180
what does the world look like

15:28.180 --> 15:33.140
when the true social catalaxy is possible?

15:33.140 --> 15:36.780
When it's actually possible for people to contribute

15:36.780 --> 15:39.140
to the production of society one with the other

15:39.140 --> 15:42.180
in ways in which half their time is not being produced

15:42.180 --> 15:44.980
on something idiotic and trivial and depressing.

15:46.860 --> 15:47.740
In order to get there

15:47.740 --> 15:50.460
and you touched up on it before already,

15:50.460 --> 15:52.460
we need different kinds of data.

15:52.460 --> 15:55.900
And so let's talk about data governance

15:55.900 --> 15:58.540
since this is actually essential to more or less

15:58.540 --> 16:00.700
all of the topics we discussed today.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.220
If I understand it correctly,

16:02.220 --> 16:04.780
you state that on a very fundamental level,

16:04.780 --> 16:08.580
there's basically always a kind of Potemkin ontology at work,

16:08.580 --> 16:10.180
which, and I quote you here,

16:10.180 --> 16:14.140
attempts to reduce reality to the level of complexity

16:14.140 --> 16:17.660
that the control system is capable of thinking with,

16:17.660 --> 16:18.500
end quote.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.620
You touched upon this already before

16:21.620 --> 16:24.060
quite at the beginning of our talk.

16:24.060 --> 16:27.100
I'm asking myself if this leaves us with a battle

16:27.100 --> 16:29.500
around the agency of different models

16:29.500 --> 16:32.140
that are used to interpret data

16:32.980 --> 16:37.100
and I'm also asking myself if and how one can successfully

16:37.100 --> 16:39.980
incorporate the reductiveness of one's model

16:39.980 --> 16:43.380
into the way the model is being applied.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.220
Sure.

16:46.220 --> 16:47.060
Yeah, good question.

16:47.060 --> 16:51.300
So there's a kind of a philosophical approach to this

16:51.300 --> 16:53.740
and more of a practical approach to this

16:53.740 --> 16:56.300
and maybe they can converge at some point,

16:56.300 --> 16:59.100
but just to sort of restate the question

16:59.140 --> 17:01.900
in a different way that,

17:03.620 --> 17:04.780
first of all, I should say that,

17:04.780 --> 17:07.260
I think part of the way in which approach this

17:07.260 --> 17:09.900
is to think of data not as something that's extracted,

17:09.900 --> 17:11.260
but as something that's produced.

17:11.260 --> 17:14.260
Data is produced about a phenomenon.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.940
Data doesn't exist out in the wild like strawberries

17:16.940 --> 17:19.420
where you can go and pick it and bring it back.

17:19.420 --> 17:20.780
It is produced in such a way

17:20.780 --> 17:24.420
that you can have 10 data scientists

17:24.420 --> 17:26.620
approach the same strawberry field

17:26.620 --> 17:28.140
and ask them to make a model of it

17:28.140 --> 17:30.780
and you get 20 different models of the strawberry field,

17:30.780 --> 17:33.940
each one of which might be statistically,

17:33.940 --> 17:36.420
scientifically accurate based on the questions

17:36.420 --> 17:37.980
and preconditions that it's asking

17:37.980 --> 17:39.900
and what it's looking for.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.220
And it's not necessarily one is more true than the other

17:43.220 --> 17:47.460
anyway more than like, you can say the word strawberry,

17:47.460 --> 17:50.540
you can say the phrase strawberry field in English

17:50.540 --> 17:53.020
and French and German and Dutch and Italian

17:53.020 --> 17:55.100
and they're all true.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.660
It's not that, obviously English is more true

17:57.660 --> 17:59.060
than all of the other ones.

17:59.940 --> 18:02.980
I'm joking, but none of the languages are more,

18:02.980 --> 18:05.260
the ontologies of the language are none of them

18:05.260 --> 18:06.300
are more true than the other.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.140
They are sort of producing a symbolic differentiation,

18:09.140 --> 18:10.420
a symbolic reference of this one.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.460
This is how I think about quantification as well

18:13.460 --> 18:14.500
in a certain sense,

18:14.500 --> 18:17.660
though that there are ways obviously then

18:17.660 --> 18:22.660
that the value of the model works

18:23.660 --> 18:28.660
not only in terms of its capacity for rhetorical rhetorically

18:28.780 --> 18:32.420
but also for its value in terms of realism

18:32.420 --> 18:37.420
and direct mimetic relation to the described.

18:38.180 --> 18:42.260
This is why we have things like astronomy and so forth.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.100
So what I mean by that is this,

18:44.100 --> 18:46.020
there's at least three different kinds of models

18:46.020 --> 18:47.300
that we want to be talking about here

18:47.300 --> 18:49.060
in terms of governance.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.340
There are descriptive models, predictive models

18:51.340 --> 18:53.220
and projective models.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.900
And they have different social functions,

18:54.900 --> 18:57.020
they have different epistemic functions

18:57.020 --> 18:59.140
and they have different political functions

19:00.100 --> 19:01.780
and scientific functions.

19:01.780 --> 19:04.700
A descriptive model basically is a model

19:04.700 --> 19:09.340
that's value is produced according to its correspondence

19:09.340 --> 19:11.500
to a mind external reality.

19:12.340 --> 19:16.100
In that heliocentrism is a reductive model

19:16.100 --> 19:19.060
of the solar system that it can be described

19:19.060 --> 19:22.260
by a series of styrofoam circles.

19:23.140 --> 19:25.380
It's a highly reductive model of the solar system

19:25.380 --> 19:27.660
but it's one that is more accurate

19:27.660 --> 19:31.820
in its representation of the solar system

19:31.820 --> 19:36.340
than a geocentric model of the solar system is in this way.

19:36.340 --> 19:39.540
Its correspondence to the real is the basis of its value.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.060
And that there's a politics of this

19:44.060 --> 19:45.740
in the sense to which it obviously has to do

19:45.740 --> 19:47.220
around the issues of climate science

19:47.220 --> 19:49.460
and our ability to, for example,

19:49.460 --> 19:54.380
is to produce a model at planetary scale

19:54.380 --> 19:58.820
of planetary material ecological processes

19:58.820 --> 20:01.540
that we believe to be accurate in the same way

20:01.540 --> 20:03.580
in which heliocentrism is accurate

20:04.620 --> 20:08.860
that would therefore give us confidence

20:08.860 --> 20:11.260
for acting recursively on its behalf

20:12.900 --> 20:16.500
because we have confidence in its representational capacity.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.580
But importantly, it's also one that,

20:18.580 --> 20:20.700
as I've mentioned before, that that model,

20:20.700 --> 20:24.060
just the way in which heliocentric astronomy

20:24.060 --> 20:25.180
could never have been produced

20:25.180 --> 20:27.740
without the technical abstraction of the telescope,

20:29.100 --> 20:32.980
the concept of climate change and planet earth science

20:32.980 --> 20:36.540
and that capacity for us to understand those processes

20:36.540 --> 20:40.780
with a realist model at any degree of sophistication

20:40.780 --> 20:43.180
is also dependent upon the technical abstraction

20:43.180 --> 20:44.860
of planetary scale computation.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.340
That's in fact, again,

20:47.340 --> 20:49.820
what planetary scale computation is for.

20:49.820 --> 20:52.020
There's also then a predictive model.

20:52.020 --> 20:54.100
So predictive models have to do with the value

20:54.100 --> 20:55.980
of the predictive model is not necessarily

20:55.980 --> 20:58.620
in how much they correspond to the real,

20:58.620 --> 21:01.580
but in how much they allow you to anticipate

21:01.580 --> 21:03.020
what is likely to happen.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.940
A simulation is to some extent,

21:05.940 --> 21:07.700
a kind of a blurring between the predictive

21:07.700 --> 21:09.420
and the realist model in this regard.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.140
It's particularly in terms of climate structures,

21:11.140 --> 21:14.540
but more stronger predictive model

21:14.540 --> 21:15.940
is more like what Wall Street does

21:15.980 --> 21:16.980
where they're trying to figure out

21:16.980 --> 21:20.540
what the likely price of Bitcoin is going to be next month

21:20.540 --> 21:23.740
or whether it's gonna make more sense

21:23.740 --> 21:28.740
to put money in Microsoft or Alibaba or something

21:30.060 --> 21:33.380
where the value of it has more to do

21:33.380 --> 21:35.260
with just the ability to predict

21:35.260 --> 21:36.620
what is likely to happen next.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.540
It's a kind of perspective heuristic.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.980
But then there's also then the projective model.

21:41.980 --> 21:45.900
The projective model is a normative model.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.380
It's a model that's not describing

21:48.380 --> 21:51.980
what is happening right now empirically.

21:51.980 --> 21:53.380
It's not a model that's describing

21:53.380 --> 21:55.460
what is most likely to happen.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.660
It's a model describing what should happen,

21:58.580 --> 22:00.980
what should happen, a drawing of what should happen.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.140
And so architecture, for example,

22:03.140 --> 22:06.420
most of its expertise is with the perspective model.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.420
It's you don't hire an architect

22:08.420 --> 22:11.020
to make a model of a building that already exists.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.580
You don't hire an architect to make a model

22:12.580 --> 22:14.820
of a building that's most likely to happen.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.540
You hire them to make a model of the building

22:16.540 --> 22:17.540
that should happen.

22:18.620 --> 22:22.140
And part of the role in I think both for politics,

22:22.140 --> 22:25.540
for design, even for political science

22:25.540 --> 22:30.540
is in the construction of projective models

22:30.700 --> 22:35.700
and prospective models based on descriptive models

22:35.700 --> 22:40.700
and grounded in descriptive models

22:41.220 --> 22:45.980
such that we have some ability not only to predict

22:45.980 --> 22:49.700
what is likely to happen in the case of climate catastrophe,

22:49.700 --> 22:52.620
but also to actually model what should happen.

22:52.620 --> 22:55.700
And so your question about where does governance

22:55.700 --> 22:57.940
and politics fit into this direction of data,

22:57.940 --> 23:00.180
I think there's at least three different answers

23:00.180 --> 23:03.140
to this question in relationship to the descriptive model,

23:03.140 --> 23:05.180
the projective model and the projective model

23:05.180 --> 23:09.180
that there's a logic for of how it is that we,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.420
for example, how it is that we might describe

23:12.380 --> 23:13.980
the planetarity that we want,

23:13.980 --> 23:18.980
describe what a viable planetarity is in a normative sense,

23:19.540 --> 23:22.660
in a projective sense, in an aspirational sense

23:22.660 --> 23:25.420
through the models, through its models

23:26.620 --> 23:29.060
that is also dependent upon the use of models

23:29.060 --> 23:34.060
to actually produce some kind of reliable description

23:35.060 --> 23:36.820
of the circumstance.

23:36.820 --> 23:41.260
And you can imagine, you can imagine,

23:41.260 --> 23:42.740
sort of skipping forward a little bit here,

23:42.740 --> 23:45.580
but you can imagine the ways in which this kind of,

23:45.580 --> 23:47.580
where algorithmic governance,

23:47.580 --> 23:50.300
which again would imply both how we govern algorithms

23:50.300 --> 23:53.060
and how we algorithms become part of the governing function

23:53.060 --> 23:56.260
more generally, how it is that algorithmic governance

23:56.260 --> 24:00.820
could become so ingrained in how it is that we function,

24:00.820 --> 24:03.820
how it is the city functions, how it is that states function,

24:03.820 --> 24:06.100
how it is the corporations function and so forth and so on

24:06.100 --> 24:09.100
that you can imagine something like a political party

24:10.060 --> 24:14.820
that is basically a software stack

24:14.820 --> 24:17.780
where you could imagine you've got four political parties

24:17.780 --> 24:22.020
all vying for being for the city government.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.780
And each one of these political parties

24:23.780 --> 24:25.620
is in essence running a simulation

24:25.620 --> 24:29.940
of what they think the city of the next few years

24:29.940 --> 24:32.260
is going to be based on the variables

24:32.260 --> 24:33.940
that they think is important

24:33.940 --> 24:36.900
based on what their political ideology is,

24:36.900 --> 24:39.580
running this in a sort of massive simulation

24:39.580 --> 24:40.980
of what this future would be.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.260
And then the voters decide,

24:42.260 --> 24:45.860
I'm going to like party number three wins the election.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.700
And once you win the election, your servers go live.

24:49.660 --> 24:54.660
And that in fact, and that becomes the basis of the city.

24:54.660 --> 24:58.860
I mean, this is one way of sort of thinking about that,

24:58.860 --> 25:00.660
thinking about that kind of dynamic.

25:01.580 --> 25:03.980
There's a bigger question though, again,

25:03.980 --> 25:06.980
around sort of the longer term arc of this

25:06.980 --> 25:10.780
of not just how it is that the data can be used

25:10.780 --> 25:13.260
within the existing political institutional structures

25:13.260 --> 25:17.860
that we already have, city governments, state governments,

25:17.860 --> 25:20.140
country governments, UN, whatever,

25:20.140 --> 25:24.140
but the ways in which that at a certain scale

25:24.140 --> 25:28.340
and at a certain point that it becomes a qualitatively,

25:28.340 --> 25:33.340
it constitutes and enables qualitatively different forms

25:34.300 --> 25:37.900
of governance per se that could not have existed otherwise.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.700
And that not only demand,

25:40.700 --> 25:44.860
but indeed already constitute other institutional forms

25:44.860 --> 25:45.860
in the first place.

25:45.860 --> 25:50.860
And it should be clear while I'm interested in the former,

25:52.780 --> 25:56.540
how would it, with my servers going live scenario,

25:56.540 --> 25:58.660
my longer term interest is in the latter.

25:58.660 --> 26:02.020
My longer term interest is in how planetary scale

26:02.020 --> 26:06.780
computation as a whole constitutes the basis

26:06.780 --> 26:10.140
by which it becomes possible, perhaps for the first time

26:11.740 --> 26:15.300
for an always already planetary scale human society

26:16.980 --> 26:21.540
to be able to produce reliable technical abstractions

26:21.540 --> 26:26.060
about its own processes at a scale commensurate

26:26.060 --> 26:27.700
with those processes itself,

26:27.700 --> 26:29.940
which is to say planetary scale,

26:29.940 --> 26:32.820
that would allow for a reorganization

26:32.820 --> 26:37.820
of some of the fundamentals of a economic, political

26:38.820 --> 26:42.820
and ecological circumstance.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.260
That is where I try to link this question

26:45.260 --> 26:46.500
of planetary scale compilation

26:46.500 --> 26:49.500
to some of the questions of planetarity per se

26:49.500 --> 26:52.420
that animates the work of people like Spivak or Mbembe

26:52.420 --> 26:55.060
and where they have an emphasis on literacy,

26:55.060 --> 26:56.860
which in my mind is a bit more numeracy.

26:58.020 --> 27:03.020
The bigger question of how it is that it's possible

27:03.820 --> 27:08.820
for collective reason to be made to manifest itself.

27:09.620 --> 27:14.180
How is it possible for society to compose itself?

27:14.180 --> 27:16.580
And I think one of the things we've seen in the pandemic

27:16.580 --> 27:20.820
in the West, the calamity of how the West has dealt

27:20.820 --> 27:25.180
with the pandemic is a dramatic example

27:25.180 --> 27:30.180
of how much the West is now unable to compose itself,

27:30.180 --> 27:35.180
unable for a society to organize itself in a kind of way.

27:35.980 --> 27:39.780
Certainly the United States and UK and Italy

27:39.780 --> 27:44.780
and Germany are some of the more tragic examples of this.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.140
But this is the real question

27:49.140 --> 27:52.780
of how can a society sense itself

27:53.740 --> 27:55.900
so that it knows what's going on?

27:55.900 --> 27:58.380
How can it model itself in different ways

27:58.380 --> 28:01.540
so that it can produce multiple and different conceptions

28:01.540 --> 28:04.100
of its own collective image?

28:04.980 --> 28:07.820
How can it simulate its possible futures

28:07.820 --> 28:11.620
so that it understands what its possible capacities are?

28:11.620 --> 28:14.060
And then how can these models of the future

28:14.060 --> 28:17.060
recursively act back upon that society

28:17.060 --> 28:19.900
so that it is able to manifest this capacity

28:19.900 --> 28:22.500
for self-composition and collective reason?

28:23.780 --> 28:25.340
That's what data governance is for.

28:25.340 --> 28:26.700
That's what data governance is, I think,

28:26.700 --> 28:27.860
to be in the long-term.

28:29.500 --> 28:33.020
Fantastic. Benjamin, I would like to leave some time

28:33.020 --> 28:34.540
for the students to ask questions,

28:34.540 --> 28:37.540
but there is one closing question

28:37.540 --> 28:39.340
I'd like to ask all of my guests.

28:39.340 --> 28:41.580
And that is, if you think about the future,

28:41.580 --> 28:43.180
what makes you joyful?

28:47.940 --> 28:50.380
I'll just give a simple answer.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.500
My son, my 12-year-old son,

28:56.500 --> 28:58.660
I have more the idea of thinking about

29:00.100 --> 29:04.020
just the process of watching him understand

29:04.020 --> 29:07.300
more and more of how the world works around him

29:07.300 --> 29:10.260
and seeing his interest and frustration

29:10.260 --> 29:11.100
in the rest of this.

29:11.100 --> 29:16.100
And so, probably the ability to think about

29:17.420 --> 29:19.740
the world that he will grow up in

29:19.740 --> 29:21.580
and the world that he will sort of go through

29:21.580 --> 29:23.300
and just sort of think about it on that arc,

29:23.300 --> 29:27.260
it kind of gives you, there's just a sense of,

29:27.260 --> 29:30.900
there's a sense of the stakes of what's at stake,

29:32.060 --> 29:33.540
what's at stake for the future

29:34.620 --> 29:37.420
and where, sort of, to mean.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.820
So, I mean, that's, I mean, it's a simple, stupid answer,

29:40.820 --> 29:42.220
but it's really, you know, like the most,

29:42.220 --> 29:44.860
that kind of like immediately honest one.

29:45.860 --> 29:47.460
You know, more philosophically,

29:47.460 --> 29:49.740
it kind of depends on what we mean by the future.

29:49.740 --> 29:51.820
You know, there's a, we have a problem

29:51.820 --> 29:52.940
of thinking about the future

29:52.940 --> 29:55.580
in terms of the scale of human lifespans,

29:57.540 --> 30:01.460
but, you know, the environments and ecologies

30:01.460 --> 30:04.420
in which we live operate on a different kind of scale.

30:04.420 --> 30:07.300
But, I don't know, there's more specific things,

30:07.300 --> 30:08.660
but I'll just sort of leave it,

30:08.660 --> 30:10.460
I'll kind of leave it at that, maybe.

30:11.460 --> 30:12.300
Fantastic.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.100
Benjamin, thank you so much for your time

30:14.100 --> 30:16.780
and thanks a lot for being part of Future Histories.

30:16.780 --> 30:17.620
My pleasure.

30:17.620 --> 30:18.900
Thank you for inviting me.

30:24.620 --> 30:25.940
Thank you so much for listening.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.340
This has been the interview with Benjamin Breton

30:28.340 --> 30:30.860
that I did in the context of my guest lecture

30:30.860 --> 30:33.540
at the Goldsmiths College in London.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.340
Thanks a lot to Mattia for inviting me

30:36.340 --> 30:41.340
and thanks a thousand times to Benjamin for taking part.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.180
I could not have imagined a better transition

30:44.180 --> 30:47.940
from 2020 into 21 than having Benjamin Breton

30:47.940 --> 30:51.020
as a guest in the last episode of 2020

30:51.020 --> 30:54.540
and then the second part as a start for this year,

30:54.540 --> 30:57.020
so I absolutely love it.

30:57.020 --> 31:00.220
You will now hear the discussion that took place afterwards

31:00.220 --> 31:03.260
and since we didn't have any consent from the students

31:03.260 --> 31:08.260
in terms of releasing their questions as the original audio,

31:08.460 --> 31:12.460
I will simply restate them in order to avoid any problems

31:12.460 --> 31:14.740
in terms of privacy.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.100
The first question comes from Mattia,

31:17.100 --> 31:19.620
so this one I won't have to restate,

31:19.620 --> 31:21.500
but then afterwards I will do so.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.940
Please enjoy.

31:22.940 --> 31:27.940
Perhaps I can ask one question that made all together

31:28.700 --> 31:30.940
what has been said in such detail.

31:33.900 --> 31:37.820
You presented very poignantly

31:37.860 --> 31:42.180
the problem of not thinking technology, politics,

31:42.180 --> 31:45.180
and subjectivity in the classic.

31:45.180 --> 31:46.820
I absolutely agree it is paramount

31:46.820 --> 31:48.980
that we look at these issues.

31:48.980 --> 31:50.620
You did say something at some point

31:50.620 --> 31:52.580
that seemed to me to go against the grain

31:52.580 --> 31:53.900
of the rest of what you were saying

31:53.900 --> 31:56.580
and probably just the way I heard it,

31:56.580 --> 31:59.500
but I think it's important to expand on it.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.420
At some point you said that your best guess

32:03.420 --> 32:08.420
or your look forward was that the superstructure

32:08.740 --> 32:11.620
would prevail over the base structure

32:11.620 --> 32:15.540
in terms of where agency and gravity are located.

32:15.540 --> 32:16.620
No, no, no, no, no, no.

32:16.620 --> 32:19.460
The other way that I was arguing,

32:19.460 --> 32:22.060
just on the point of cause and effect,

32:22.060 --> 32:26.300
I was suggesting that if we want to ask the question

32:26.300 --> 32:28.580
in the totally over reductive way

32:28.580 --> 32:29.860
or if I want to answer the question

32:29.860 --> 32:31.460
in this very over reductive way

32:31.540 --> 32:35.220
of whether or not the culture causes infrastructure,

32:35.220 --> 32:37.460
infrastructure causes culture,

32:37.460 --> 32:40.660
and where we should invest our time,

32:40.660 --> 32:45.220
I would argue I'm on team base causes infrastructure,

32:45.220 --> 32:46.300
base causes superstructure,

32:46.300 --> 32:47.460
base causes superstructure, right,

32:47.460 --> 32:50.900
so that the geotechnology causes geoculture

32:50.900 --> 32:54.060
was more where I was trying to come down on that.

32:54.060 --> 32:56.500
The first student question is,

32:56.500 --> 32:58.900
since you were talking about pricing the future,

32:58.900 --> 33:01.140
I was interested in how that applies

33:01.140 --> 33:04.540
to Shojana Zuboff's surveillance capitalism approach

33:04.540 --> 33:07.820
and how pricing the future could impact individuals

33:07.820 --> 33:10.460
and the kind of ethical implications of that.

33:11.940 --> 33:14.260
Right, so you're right.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.100
I think it's certainly correct

33:17.100 --> 33:20.700
that this question of pricing the future

33:20.700 --> 33:24.780
is something that already exists.

33:24.780 --> 33:26.540
It's not something that would be,

33:26.860 --> 33:31.860
it's already part of the way in which our economies work.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.340
Our economies in many respects are,

33:35.340 --> 33:37.340
whether that's the stock market

33:37.340 --> 33:41.580
or pricing the future attention of an individual user

33:41.580 --> 33:42.980
or something like that,

33:42.980 --> 33:46.980
that pricing the future is not something

33:46.980 --> 33:49.940
that would need to be introduced ex nihilo

33:49.940 --> 33:51.580
or invented from tabula rasa.

33:51.580 --> 33:54.540
It's actually already part of the system.

33:55.220 --> 33:59.980
And then what I'm suggesting then is that the recognition

33:59.980 --> 34:03.020
of this as a strategy and the recognition of this

34:03.020 --> 34:05.900
as something that we have already built a degree

34:05.900 --> 34:08.260
of sophistication and capability with

34:08.260 --> 34:11.140
is something that should not be overlooked

34:11.140 --> 34:15.940
if the goal of the deployment of that capacity

34:15.940 --> 34:17.900
is for something other than predicting

34:17.900 --> 34:19.540
whether or not a user is,

34:20.060 --> 34:25.060
the purpose of this is for rectifying the pathologies

34:25.340 --> 34:28.100
identified as part of the capless pricing problem

34:28.100 --> 34:31.540
as opposed to predicting whether or not a user

34:31.540 --> 34:35.140
is likely to look at this particular cat video

34:35.140 --> 34:36.860
or that particular cat video,

34:37.740 --> 34:41.420
that the relevancy of this technical capacity

34:41.420 --> 34:44.820
is being suppressed by the stupidity

34:44.820 --> 34:46.660
of the way in which we are using

34:46.660 --> 34:48.620
planetary scale computation.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.980
To underscore the point,

34:52.580 --> 34:56.220
one of the differences I have with Zuboff on this point is,

34:56.220 --> 34:59.300
whereas I think for Zuboff, the individual,

34:59.300 --> 35:02.100
the privacy and sovereignty of the individual

35:02.100 --> 35:05.540
as the core unit of planetary scale computation

35:05.540 --> 35:08.020
is not only left unquestioned,

35:08.020 --> 35:11.820
it's in fact re-fortified as the basis of something

35:11.820 --> 35:14.460
that needs to be re-privatized,

35:14.460 --> 35:17.300
that needs to be re-individuated,

35:17.300 --> 35:20.340
that needs to be further individuated

35:20.340 --> 35:24.260
from the supervisory manipulative molestation

35:24.260 --> 35:25.460
from the platforms.

35:28.980 --> 35:32.260
I think deeper and probably more fundamental critique

35:32.260 --> 35:33.940
of the way planetary scale computation works

35:33.940 --> 35:38.940
is that this unit of the self-sovereign private

35:39.300 --> 35:42.300
and privatized individual as the space unit

35:42.300 --> 35:45.340
is itself a kind of original sin

35:45.340 --> 35:47.660
for how we have organized planetary scale computation.

35:47.660 --> 35:52.100
And there is no solution, no kind of social dilemma,

35:53.780 --> 35:55.340
restructuring our privacy,

35:55.340 --> 35:58.660
re-fortifying our anonymity in relationship to one another

35:58.660 --> 35:59.940
in relation to the system

35:59.940 --> 36:02.580
that will ultimately solve that problem.

36:02.580 --> 36:06.780
I think in many ways it's actually re-fortifying that problem

36:06.780 --> 36:08.580
by re-conquering this idea.

36:08.580 --> 36:12.580
So saying the same thing in a few different ways,

36:12.580 --> 36:17.580
but the more fundamental point of the predictive capacity,

36:18.700 --> 36:20.460
the kind of preemptive logic,

36:21.580 --> 36:23.940
the pricing of preemption,

36:23.940 --> 36:27.380
even within planetary scale computation

36:27.380 --> 36:28.260
is something that exists

36:28.260 --> 36:30.460
both in terms of something we might admire,

36:30.460 --> 36:32.220
as in climate science,

36:32.220 --> 36:35.380
where we are preemptively simulating the future

36:35.380 --> 36:37.020
through scenarios,

36:37.020 --> 36:38.780
and something we might not admire

36:38.780 --> 36:40.660
in terms of the preemptive simulation

36:40.660 --> 36:43.620
of what individual users might click on.

36:43.620 --> 36:44.460
But you're correct

36:44.460 --> 36:47.300
that this capacity for preemption already exists.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.540
The next student question is,

36:49.540 --> 36:51.060
picking up on your last point

36:51.060 --> 36:52.700
of predictive, prescriptive,

36:52.700 --> 36:54.980
and projective models of governance,

36:54.980 --> 36:57.100
I was curious how well you think humans

36:57.100 --> 36:58.580
are even able to determine

36:58.580 --> 37:01.940
how well computers or algorithms are modeling.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.540
So when we move into global computation,

37:04.540 --> 37:06.780
or we've already been in global computation,

37:06.780 --> 37:08.420
how well we are actually able

37:08.420 --> 37:11.260
to evaluate models going forward.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.780
Taking chess or Go as an example,

37:13.780 --> 37:17.020
which are comparatively extremely simple systems,

37:17.020 --> 37:19.500
but we already struggle to evaluate

37:19.500 --> 37:21.420
how well computers model them.

37:21.420 --> 37:24.100
They play a lot of moves that we think look wrong,

37:24.100 --> 37:27.140
and only turn out to be effective much later on,

37:27.140 --> 37:29.820
or much further down the road at the end of the game.

37:29.820 --> 37:31.860
So I'm wondering from our perspective,

37:31.860 --> 37:33.780
how well we are able to evaluate

37:33.780 --> 37:36.180
how good the models actually are.

37:37.140 --> 37:40.740
Yeah, it's a really important question,

37:40.740 --> 37:42.460
and one that is doesn't have a,

37:42.460 --> 37:46.140
one that gets more complicated and more interesting

37:46.140 --> 37:51.140
the more you continue to ask it with greater specificity.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.260
So thank you for that.

37:54.260 --> 37:59.260
I think it has a bit of a question around,

38:01.100 --> 38:03.180
if we keep this differentiation as I proposed

38:03.180 --> 38:05.980
between descriptive, predictive, and projective models,

38:06.820 --> 38:09.420
we might have different ways of answering that.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.980
If that is a descriptive model,

38:11.980 --> 38:14.180
the function of which has the ability,

38:14.180 --> 38:17.180
is supposed to be a kind of reductive,

38:17.180 --> 38:20.380
a reductive approximation of a mind-independent reality,

38:20.380 --> 38:22.100
like heliocentrism or something,

38:22.100 --> 38:24.500
at least we have the experimental method

38:24.500 --> 38:26.620
to try to test the model over and over again,

38:26.620 --> 38:28.380
and to try to find out,

38:28.380 --> 38:31.500
to try to test the descriptive capacity of the model

38:31.500 --> 38:33.580
through its predictive capacity.

38:33.580 --> 38:36.980
That is, if this model is true,

38:36.980 --> 38:38.500
then it should be able to predict

38:38.500 --> 38:41.820
what is going to happen under experimental conditions,

38:41.820 --> 38:42.860
X, Y, or Z.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.180
And if under those conditions,

38:45.180 --> 38:46.580
it's not able to predict it,

38:46.580 --> 38:49.260
then we realize that its description might be a bit wrong.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.660
And so, you know, science marches forward

38:51.660 --> 38:56.420
through that kind of testing capacity.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.460
The projective models are ones

38:59.460 --> 39:01.780
that are a little bit more difficult,

39:01.780 --> 39:03.140
but it's also interesting to speak,

39:03.140 --> 39:05.580
since we're talking about temporality of models,

39:05.580 --> 39:06.900
you know, one of the interesting things

39:06.900 --> 39:09.460
about climate models is the way in which

39:09.460 --> 39:12.860
the future is validated against the past.

39:13.860 --> 39:16.140
And what I mean by that is this,

39:16.140 --> 39:17.500
the ways in which,

39:17.500 --> 39:19.340
and I'm sure you're probably aware of that,

39:19.340 --> 39:20.780
but I'll just mention the point

39:20.780 --> 39:23.140
in the context of this question,

39:23.140 --> 39:25.260
the way in which we have some degree of confidence

39:25.260 --> 39:27.660
in why it is that we think that the world

39:27.660 --> 39:30.580
will look a certain way in 2040 or 2050,

39:31.420 --> 39:34.860
given whatever ecological variables

39:34.860 --> 39:37.740
we wish to emphasize,

39:37.740 --> 39:40.780
is because you test that model against past data.

39:40.780 --> 39:42.380
And so, for example, you'll take,

39:42.380 --> 39:43.420
here's the model,

39:43.420 --> 39:46.180
what we think is gonna happen between 2020 and 2050

39:46.180 --> 39:49.060
in that 30-year arc based on these variables.

39:49.060 --> 39:51.060
Let's take that model and try to predict

39:51.060 --> 39:54.460
what would happen between 1820 and 1850

39:55.340 --> 39:57.260
based on what that model should tell us

39:57.260 --> 39:59.660
what would likely happen.

39:59.660 --> 40:03.060
And then you go back and look at what did happen in 1850.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.980
And if the prediction turned out to be true,

40:05.980 --> 40:07.500
if the prediction of the future

40:07.500 --> 40:09.780
turns out to be able to predict the past,

40:09.780 --> 40:11.820
then you have a degree of confidence

40:11.820 --> 40:16.140
in the way in which it would work.

40:16.140 --> 40:17.820
Now, your question, though,

40:17.820 --> 40:20.340
about the kind of the patterns within this,

40:20.340 --> 40:22.300
and I think a lot of it has to do with

40:22.300 --> 40:23.980
the way in which models allow us

40:23.980 --> 40:28.500
to deduce and abstract patterns.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.700
And as I've said a few times,

40:29.700 --> 40:32.460
this capacity for technical abstraction

40:32.460 --> 40:34.300
of collective technical abstraction

40:34.300 --> 40:37.740
is one of the important epistemological functions

40:37.740 --> 40:39.460
of planetary scale computation.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.460
And I'll just emphasize the point here.

40:42.580 --> 40:44.940
There is, in many ways,

40:44.940 --> 40:47.660
the arguments I'm making have as much to do

40:47.660 --> 40:49.220
with the way in which the technologies

40:49.220 --> 40:50.620
function instrumentally.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.700
That is, what are we able to do with them?

40:52.700 --> 40:54.820
But equally importantly, if not more,

40:54.820 --> 40:57.220
is the epistemological function of the technologies.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.660
How is it that through using of these technologies,

40:59.660 --> 41:01.060
we're able to know things

41:01.060 --> 41:03.500
that we wouldn't have been able to know otherwise?

41:03.500 --> 41:04.340
And in many cases,

41:04.340 --> 41:05.780
it's the epistemological function

41:05.780 --> 41:07.820
of planetary scale computation that's most important,

41:07.820 --> 41:10.700
that's more important in the long run, I think.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.020
But your examples of AlphaGo and the chess

41:13.020 --> 41:15.060
and the rest of this bring up an important point,

41:15.060 --> 41:18.580
and that is, in theory,

41:18.580 --> 41:20.980
the function of something like an AI

41:20.980 --> 41:25.380
would be that it is able to see patterns in the world

41:25.380 --> 41:26.620
and patterns in the data

41:26.660 --> 41:29.060
that we would not be able to intuit on our own.

41:29.060 --> 41:31.700
Otherwise, why would we bother building them?

41:31.700 --> 41:34.780
That it's able to see something we can't see.

41:36.940 --> 41:41.140
But what happens when it seems to see something

41:41.140 --> 41:45.460
that seems so weird and unlikely

41:45.460 --> 41:50.460
that we're not sure whether or not it's stupid or ingenious?

41:50.540 --> 41:52.180
We don't know whether or not

41:52.180 --> 41:56.540
there's obviously a deep error in our presumptions

41:57.460 --> 41:58.940
and we've produced a machine that's incapable

41:58.940 --> 42:02.020
of producing nothing but stupid noise,

42:02.020 --> 42:04.180
or we've produced this genius machine

42:04.180 --> 42:05.260
that's able to see patterns

42:05.260 --> 42:07.700
that we never would have seen otherwise

42:07.700 --> 42:10.220
and cause and effect relationships between dynamics

42:10.220 --> 42:14.580
that we've overlooked for our entire evolutionary career.

42:14.580 --> 42:15.740
How would we know?

42:16.620 --> 42:20.180
How would we know whether a totally unlikely pattern

42:20.180 --> 42:25.180
is trivial or fantastically important?

42:26.180 --> 42:31.100
And someone needs to invent a name for this within AI,

42:31.100 --> 42:34.060
I think, where the AI finds a pattern

42:34.060 --> 42:36.860
that we don't recognize as being logical

42:36.860 --> 42:40.220
and yet we have to, in essence, take this,

42:40.220 --> 42:45.220
we have to decide in a way to decide to believe the pattern

42:45.980 --> 42:48.220
or decide not to believe it in a way.

42:49.420 --> 42:53.060
And this is again part of the epistemological complexity

42:53.060 --> 42:53.900
of these technologies.

42:54.060 --> 42:56.380
The example that you gave of AlphaGo

42:56.380 --> 42:57.940
is the key one here,

42:57.940 --> 42:59.940
is the one that everyone refers to

42:59.940 --> 43:01.460
in relationship to this phenomenon,

43:01.460 --> 43:03.820
is that, and for those that,

43:03.820 --> 43:07.100
the computer made this move that at the time,

43:08.140 --> 43:09.460
early in the game,

43:09.460 --> 43:13.740
move 33, I think, of the game against Lee Sedol,

43:13.740 --> 43:18.340
that everyone thought, oh my God, the machine, it's broken.

43:18.340 --> 43:19.300
The AI is broken.

43:19.300 --> 43:21.860
This is very embarrassing for Google.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.660
Right in the middle of game three,

43:24.420 --> 43:25.740
their computer went nuts

43:25.740 --> 43:28.540
and placed a stone way off in the middle of nowhere

43:28.540 --> 43:33.420
and, oh shit, this Google stock's gonna go down,

43:33.420 --> 43:34.420
everything's horrible.

43:34.420 --> 43:36.100
And then, lo and behold,

43:36.100 --> 43:38.740
over a period of the rest of the game,

43:38.740 --> 43:41.140
the whole game arcs towards this one stone

43:41.140 --> 43:44.060
in such a way that it turned out to be ingenious

43:44.060 --> 43:46.220
and as the Sedol, the Go player said,

43:46.220 --> 43:48.340
no human ever would have made that move.

43:49.220 --> 43:53.020
And it was also seen example of the ways in which

43:54.580 --> 43:57.380
it was something that we could take as optimistic,

43:57.380 --> 43:58.460
at least in this regard,

43:58.460 --> 44:03.460
that part of the problem of reinforcement learning-based AIs

44:03.500 --> 44:08.500
and, indeed, using big data models of the past

44:09.340 --> 44:11.620
in order to simulate the future

44:11.620 --> 44:13.940
is that you run the risk of, in essence,

44:13.940 --> 44:17.100
just replicating pre-existing patterns

44:17.100 --> 44:19.940
and presuming that pre-existing patterns

44:19.940 --> 44:22.460
will be continuous into the future

44:22.460 --> 44:25.220
in ways that, in essence, make it so.

44:25.220 --> 44:28.220
You're enforcing the possibility

44:28.220 --> 44:31.740
that pre-existing patterns would be the future patterns

44:31.740 --> 44:33.500
by, in essence, predicting it

44:33.500 --> 44:35.140
and then acting on those predictions.

44:35.140 --> 44:38.580
And so some of the people who do serious work

44:38.580 --> 44:39.940
around AI bias,

44:39.940 --> 44:42.260
there's a lot of un-serious work around AI bias too.

44:42.260 --> 44:44.660
People who do serious work around AI bias,

44:44.660 --> 44:46.500
a lot of the work is based on this question

44:46.500 --> 44:47.740
that you have previous patterns

44:47.740 --> 44:49.900
and that making predictions and policies

44:50.020 --> 44:52.460
and the previous patterns will enforce this,

44:52.460 --> 44:56.140
which is a real and serious general problem

44:57.820 --> 45:01.220
about the ways in which previous models replicate themselves.

45:01.220 --> 45:03.580
What it showed with the AlphaGo thing

45:03.580 --> 45:08.220
was at least the possibility that, no, novelty is possible,

45:08.220 --> 45:10.340
that there is some way in which,

45:11.180 --> 45:13.380
even through the reinforcement learning methods

45:13.380 --> 45:15.700
of the built AlphaGo,

45:15.700 --> 45:18.500
that in this production and its conceptualization

45:18.500 --> 45:22.140
and its prediction and its sort of stochastic perspective,

45:22.140 --> 45:26.540
prediction of what the right move would be.

45:26.540 --> 45:28.340
And in this case, the right move would be part

45:28.340 --> 45:29.940
of what we're calling a projective model,

45:29.940 --> 45:32.380
a normative model, not a descriptive predictive,

45:32.380 --> 45:34.660
but a normative model of what the right move would be,

45:34.660 --> 45:36.420
that it could come up with something

45:36.420 --> 45:40.020
that we would never have thought of itself.

45:40.020 --> 45:44.340
That it was an example that AI is capable of being

45:44.340 --> 45:47.300
a kind of epistemic machine

45:47.300 --> 45:52.140
that's capable of producing ideas, producing novelty,

45:52.140 --> 45:55.500
producing patterns we wouldn't have been able to see.

45:55.500 --> 46:01.420
And in that sense, I take the weird alienation

46:01.420 --> 46:03.220
we may have had from the logic of that move

46:03.220 --> 46:09.020
as very optimistic, as very, very good news in this kind of regard.

46:09.020 --> 46:14.220
But again, your question about how do we validate the model

46:14.220 --> 46:15.980
and how do we not only validate the model,

46:15.980 --> 46:17.780
whether it's come up with something stupid,

46:17.780 --> 46:22.100
but how do we ensure that even the validity of past models,

46:22.100 --> 46:25.580
how do we outsource size ourselves from this position

46:25.580 --> 46:30.740
where the previous models are simply replicating themselves,

46:30.740 --> 46:33.580
becoming recursive in the bad sense,

46:33.580 --> 46:39.220
becoming a kind of echo effect where we're using all of these systems

46:39.220 --> 46:43.060
as simply a way to enforce the condition

46:43.100 --> 46:46.540
by which the future is just an echo of the past.

46:46.540 --> 46:49.540
This is also a way in which our relationship to these models

46:49.540 --> 46:54.180
must be seriously interrogated.

46:54.180 --> 46:57.260
The other side of this is, so you could think of it in this way,

46:57.260 --> 46:59.380
one, how do you use these models in such a way

46:59.380 --> 47:03.500
that you can act upon their implications recursively,

47:03.500 --> 47:06.340
which is what we want to do with climate change models,

47:06.340 --> 47:11.340
but also how do you ensure that these models continue to accelerate

47:11.340 --> 47:15.540
the space-based search function by which they're able to identify

47:15.540 --> 47:21.140
and look for and produce novelty, produce innovation,

47:21.140 --> 47:24.460
produce something that hasn't happened before?

47:24.460 --> 47:30.380
And I think a lot of the philosophy of computation

47:30.380 --> 47:34.900
of the next several decades will be based upon that conflict

47:34.940 --> 47:40.180
between modulating recursion

47:40.180 --> 47:45.820
and modulating face-based search and novelty production.

47:45.820 --> 47:49.300
So the last student question was asked with a strong British accent,

47:49.300 --> 47:51.860
and I hope I managed to capture the essence.

47:51.860 --> 47:56.780
The question brings up Andrew Geim and how he used very off-the-charts methods

47:56.780 --> 48:02.020
and ideas in his so-called Friday experiments when discovering graphene.

48:02.020 --> 48:05.860
In relation to that, AI seems very methodical and logical,

48:05.860 --> 48:11.580
and so there's the question of how AI could incorporate these acts of randomness,

48:11.580 --> 48:17.540
and also when it does so, how it knows when it found anything of value.

48:17.540 --> 48:20.460
Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing with the Friday experiments,

48:20.460 --> 48:24.140
is that many of them, the value of them is uncertain,

48:24.140 --> 48:28.540
where it may be that it's not as though...

48:28.580 --> 48:35.540
It's not as you can expect that through some sort of randomization process

48:35.540 --> 48:40.500
that by definition, some kind of fitness,

48:40.500 --> 48:43.100
some sort of process will necessarily hold.

48:43.100 --> 48:46.700
It's the same kind of dynamic of mutation and evolution, I suppose, in that regard.

48:46.700 --> 48:50.660
Most mutations are useless.

48:50.660 --> 48:53.100
But that's probably the same for the AI, too,

48:53.100 --> 48:57.420
that you're expecting them to every time come up with this is probably inaccurate.

48:57.420 --> 49:01.140
But I should say that there's a whole other lecture to describe about the ways...

49:01.140 --> 49:06.700
I think that also going forward, this term AI will hopefully

49:06.700 --> 49:09.500
sort of fork into a much more specific terminology,

49:09.500 --> 49:13.620
that when we're talking about the kinds of...

49:13.620 --> 49:16.460
The things that different kinds of AI are good for,

49:16.460 --> 49:21.860
where reinforcement learning versus other kinds of techniques,

49:21.860 --> 49:25.460
Judea Pearl and other people, and Gary Marcus are trying to bring back

49:25.500 --> 49:28.660
a more symbolic modeling type of structures here as well.

49:28.660 --> 49:33.060
That AI is lots of different technologies, and AI is lots of different techniques,

49:33.060 --> 49:38.380
and AI is built upon its sensing capacity as much of its calculative capacity,

49:38.380 --> 49:44.020
that the question of how can we guarantee AI is heading in one direction in terms of that,

49:44.020 --> 49:54.180
I think it will be able to ask the question with a greater deal of specificity and context.

49:54.220 --> 49:59.020
So, and I don't know, I probably would not agree with the idea that in general,

49:59.020 --> 50:11.460
AI is just a kind of brute force rationalization as its only capacity and its core capacity.

50:11.460 --> 50:15.260
But at the same time, I might suggest that there's something quite amazing

50:15.260 --> 50:18.020
about brute force rationalization in its own sense,

50:18.020 --> 50:25.100
and that it may be that many of the most interesting forms of mind-bending,

50:25.100 --> 50:32.340
pattern-finding abstraction that we learn from AI is from its brute force rationality,

50:32.340 --> 50:40.340
that we shouldn't assume that rationality and creativity are somehow the opposite of one another.

50:41.220 --> 50:51.820
In many cases, they're quite at home, and that many of the ways in which we kind of lapse into,

50:51.820 --> 51:00.380
on the human side of the ledger, lapse into convention and cliché and stereotype and muddy thinking

51:00.420 --> 51:10.620
and sort of replicating the known is because of a reliance on sort of arbitrary,

51:10.620 --> 51:19.100
irrational processes of semiotic symbolization, that in many cases the fact that we're constantly

51:19.100 --> 51:26.500
repeating ourselves is more to do with culture than it has to do with math.

51:26.780 --> 51:31.900
It may be that rationality does provide a certain kind of escape route that we shouldn't overlook.

51:31.900 --> 51:41.420
There was a question about Ted Chiang. People are probably most familiar with Ted Chiang,

51:41.420 --> 51:48.660
he's the author of the movie Arrival was based upon. Anyone who enjoyed that movie,

51:48.660 --> 51:53.260
I would strongly suggest reading the short story, it's called The Story of Your Life,

51:53.260 --> 52:04.580
which is a really fascinating story. It's based around this idea of artificial linguistics,

52:04.580 --> 52:09.860
and linguistics. It's a short story that you kind of need to know a little bit about linguistics

52:09.860 --> 52:13.900
theory in order to make your way through it, or if you make your way through the story,

52:13.900 --> 52:19.540
you will have learned quite a bit about linguistics theory by reading the story.

52:19.540 --> 52:28.700
But in terms of things like, there's a lot of interest of late, of course, in things like GPT-3

52:28.700 --> 52:37.340
and other ways in which the algorithmic production of different kinds of language as a predictive

52:37.340 --> 52:43.100
model, language as structuring model of here as well. I think if we want to go deeper on this

52:43.100 --> 52:48.700
question of where it is that the technologies of thought and the technologies of inscription,

52:48.740 --> 52:53.180
technologies of modeling, technologies of description, the basis of inscription and

52:53.180 --> 52:57.740
ontology in relationship to some of these kinds of dynamics, the relation between our own kind

52:57.740 --> 53:04.660
of cognitive prospection, the ways in which our models of the world, the Bayesian prediction

53:04.660 --> 53:10.900
functions of our models of the world are the basis of our own neuroscience, and how that gets

53:10.900 --> 53:17.980
inscribed into our capacities for signification and communication through language. This field

53:17.980 --> 53:24.540
of artificial linguistics is one that would be certainly a rich area for anyone to spend some

53:24.540 --> 53:28.700
time with. Thank you very much. It has been extremely interesting. Oh, thank you. Thanks

53:28.700 --> 53:39.900
for the invitation. Thanks a lot, Benjamin. That was our show for today. Thanks a lot for listening.

53:39.900 --> 53:45.180
If you want to support future histories, you can do so on Patreon, or you can just simply tell a

53:45.180 --> 53:50.300
friend that you heard of the show and that he or she might like it as well.

53:50.940 --> 53:53.580
Have a good time and hear you in two weeks.
