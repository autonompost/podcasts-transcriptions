0	6000	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Gross and it is my great pleasure to welcome
6000	8520	David Leibman in today's show.
8520	14680	He is Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brooklyn College, New York and editor of the journals
14680	16960	Science and Society.
16960	22020	David has written extensively about economic coordination and developed a model called
22020	28240	Multi-Level Democratic Iterative Coordination, which will be at the center of our conversation
28240	29240	today.
29240	34680	I am absolutely thrilled that this episode came together and that it did so right now
34680	41160	because the new special issue of Science and Society's project Envisioning Socialism has
41160	48560	just been published and these special issues, they are released only once every 10 years
48560	53320	and are concerned with a topic that is of great importance for the investigations of
53320	58440	this podcast and that is democratic economic planning.
58440	67560	The three predecessor issues appeared in Science and Society in Spring 1992, 2002 and 2012
67560	76360	and so I marked my calendar for Spring 2022 in order not to miss this very special opportunity
76360	81280	and I am very happy to announce that I did not only record the interview with David Leibman
81280	87360	that you are about to hear today, but also lengthy conversations with Robin Hannell and
87520	93920	with Pat Devine who are both, just like David, enormously important contributors not only
93920	101060	to these special issues starting from the first one in 1992, but they are also central
101060	107360	contributors to the debate around democratic economic planning in general.
107360	112240	This means there will be quite a couple of English language future histories episodes
112240	119240	spread over this spring and summer devoted to the topic of democratic economic planning
119240	122240	and I have a couple of remarks regarding this.
122240	128980	The first one would be to my German language audience, I am sorry, I had to do it, I simply
128980	136580	had to do this, Future Histories is a predominantly German language podcast and it will continue
136580	145080	to be so, but this was simply too perfect and so I couldn't resist and as regular listeners
145080	151380	will know, I argue for podcasting as a form of extended research practice and this deep
151380	159060	dive into democratic economic planning is to be understood as a part of exactly that.
159060	165580	So danke f√ºr eure Geduld, thank you for your patience with this long detour into English
165580	172960	language episodes and in the spirit of podcasting as research, I have an important plea directed
172960	174600	at all of you.
174600	180580	At one point in the interview you are about to hear with David, he states, and I quote,
180580	186440	the truly international discussion is still in front of us, end quote, and I could not
186440	193280	agree more, so please, if you know about interesting positions on democratic economic planning
193280	197360	from the global south, then please write me.
197360	202940	If everything works out as planned, I will feature guests from Chile soon and planning
202940	209080	in Kerala, India is also on my radar, as is the history of Soviet cybernetics, but I cannot
209080	211720	stress this enough.
211720	216660	If you know about interesting contemporary thinkers or experiments in democratic economic
216660	223260	planning from the global south and non-western positions in general, then please write me.
223260	232200	You can reach me via jan at futurehistories.today, that's J-A-N at futurehistories.today.
232200	238060	Very much looking forward to hearing about all these different approaches and experiments
238060	240600	from all over the world.
240600	246760	So now please enjoy today's episode with David Leibman on multi-level democratic iterative
246760	247760	coordination.
253760	254760	Welcome David.
254760	255760	Okay.
255760	256760	Thank you Jan.
256760	259440	It's good to be here.
259440	261520	It's my pleasure.
261520	265840	Before we get to your model specifically, let's start with a very basic definition.
265840	268600	What is democratic economic planning?
268600	269600	Okay.
269600	274540	I was going to back up a little further before that, but I'll get to democratic economic
274540	278040	planning in a moment.
278040	283940	I wanted to start by referring to all of the buzz in the world around the concept of socialism
283940	285180	as such.
285180	291420	There's a lot of discussion of socialism, a renewal of interest, and this is of course
291420	298300	very important for us, I think, and very important for the way the world is going to go.
298300	303340	So I wanted to suggest a few distinctions.
303340	310320	For many people, the word socialism means what I call ameliorative socialism, ameliorate,
310320	315760	make better, improve, and they can think of, and I can think of, all sorts of improvements
315760	319480	that we want to make in the world.
319480	325200	We want a world of equality, a world of solidarity, a world of participation, a world of security,
325200	326200	dignity.
326200	332160	These are some words that clearly come into the concept, and I'm happy to situate all
332160	338900	the work that I'm doing, and everyone who's working on what I call systemic socialism
338900	343940	would be part of, you know, we're all part of that, but we need to go further.
343940	350420	The second distinction is what I call inspirational socialism, and it takes its cue from some
350420	355760	phrases from the classics of Marxism, and not only Marxism, but there are inspirational
355760	360660	socialists who refer to thinkers going much farther back.
360660	364880	And here you have phrases like the world of the associated producers and the working
364880	369860	class in power and the commonwealth of toil.
369860	375900	One can go on and on, you know, with these wonderful inspirational phrases from the past,
375900	381060	and the kind of socialism that I, and I gather many of the people who have participated in
381060	389500	your symposium series, is interested in, is going beyond that.
389540	395420	In other words, we need to not just talk in general terms about the working class in power,
395420	402700	or to use a phrase from the manifesto where Marx and Engels speak about the condition
402700	408380	for the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all, you know,
408380	414140	this kind of language, which is wonderful, but it clearly needs to be transcended.
414140	419860	We need to put some meat on those bones, so to speak.
419860	426940	And finally, you have speculative socialism, you know, speculative utopian, where just
426940	433820	like the kind of thing that Marx was so concerned to transcend in the early part of the 19th
433820	440140	century, where there were all these writers, some of them very brilliant, putting forward
440140	445740	completely arbitrary idealist visions of how things would work and telling everybody
445740	449860	things will be done this way, and you will have this kind of institution and that kind
449860	450860	of institution.
450860	453260	And Marx wanted to get away from that totally.
453260	454300	So what's left?
454300	462060	What's left is what I call systemic socialism, which is somewhere in a middle ground between
462060	469180	simply saying we want to strive for equality and so forth, the thing, the values that socialists
469180	479660	uphold on one side versus a kind of utopian or speculative arbitrary engineering of institutions,
479660	481820	which Marx was quite clear.
481820	487700	And I think most of his followers have gone along, gone on from that.
487700	494860	You simply can't preordain, you can't write what Marx called recipes for the cook shops
494860	495860	of the future.
495860	497140	It just doesn't work.
497420	502460	You have to see socialism as something that grows organically within the existing society
502460	509780	and partakes of all of that history and sort of concentrates that history.
509780	514660	So it's in that framework that I would talk about democratic coordination, democratic
514660	515780	economic planning.
515780	526420	And yes, like as with my colleagues, Pat Devine, Robin Hanell, Al Campbell, Cockshot and Cottrell,
526980	533060	Alan Cottrell and a new contributor who works with them, Dave Zechariah and many others
533060	534260	who don't write in English.
534260	535540	And for that, I apologize.
536740	540660	I do read some Spanish and some Russian, but not enough to really say that I can
541620	545060	represent the people who write in those languages.
546020	550500	And the truly international discussion that we need is still in front of us.
551140	552500	We haven't yet achieved that.
553460	555940	And I'm as much to blame as anyone for that.
555940	562020	But anyway, we're all talking about democratic economic planning and trying to figure out
562020	564020	what that could possibly mean.
564020	572020	So that's a sort of a preamble that gets us to the doorstep of the question we need to pursue.
573060	578420	And apart from the way that you approach it specifically within your model, is there
578420	582100	some kind of definition of democratic economic planning that you could provide?
582900	587140	Well, I think the definition emerges in each of the separate models.
587140	592420	And I'll have something to say about that, because what I've tried to do in a recent paper,
594020	600180	the subtitle of which is A Model of the Models, clearly the subtitle implies what I'm trying to
600180	606580	do is look at the way the various models are related to each other and to understand whether
606580	610500	some kind of synthesis might be possible.
610500	616900	When I know you have a separate agenda, we'll talk about the science and society special issue.
617540	622260	And here I'm tempted to hold it up and show everybody, but I realize there's no visual here.
622260	623700	We're on audio only.
624420	625540	But it just came out.
625540	632660	We have the special issue of science and society, which is the fourth special issue,
633300	644020	which have been issued at 10-year intervals in the 02 years, in 1992, 2002, 2012, and now 2022.
644020	648020	You know, at specific 10-year intervals, kind of why it worked out that way, but it didn't.
649540	654420	And on the re-envisioning of socialism or envisioning of socialism and
655780	661780	what struck me about the work in those issues, it made a real attempt to bring everybody in
662660	668500	we brought in proponents of market socialism, which is the idea that,
669460	672900	first of all, very important contribution markets and socialism are separable.
672900	675060	They're not the markets and capitalism.
675060	676900	Sorry, I misspoke.
676900	678420	Markets and capitalism are separate.
678420	679460	They're not the same thing.
679460	684660	And that you can combine the advantages of markets with the advantages of socialism into
684660	686100	something called market social.
686100	691220	It's not my view, but it is one of the views that we sought to represent and various views
691220	695300	of economic planning and democratic economic planning on the other side.
695300	696580	Put them in a whole big circle.
697540	704180	My perception of this from 1992 forward as we did this work was that
707620	710660	people were talking past each other to some extent.
710660	712980	We were saying something in one of the special issues.
713620	718900	And then those of us who repeated and participated in the next special issue
718900	720340	were saying the same things again.
721300	728180	But that to use a very favorite socialist economic term convergence, convergence was
728180	729140	not occurring.
729140	731460	In other words, we didn't seem to be getting closer together.
731460	734260	We didn't seem to be moving forward in that sense.
734980	740900	And part of my recent work is an effort to overcome that or an effort, at least to address
740900	748340	it, to address the problem of synthesis, convergence, transcendence, moving on to another stage.
749780	754820	So that if we have another special issue in another 10 years, I won't be around to see
754820	757380	it, but it'll be, you might.
760660	764740	It won't look the same as the one that came before, the one that came before that.
764740	766820	It will have moved forward.
767940	775620	Of course, a lot depends on the world moving forward and the progressive and working class
775620	779300	movements of the world moving forward and taking these things to heart.
781220	786020	And that is something that I cannot directly influence, but can hope for.
788340	792340	Anyway, I like also to take it a little further.
792340	797780	I like also to distinguish between different stages of socialism.
798660	805540	And here lies a major confusion in my view that is very present in many of our minds
806180	809540	we fall into it, we mix these things up.
810260	814340	We forget whether we're talking about stages of historical development.
814340	817620	And if we're talking about that, then we definitely mean
819300	824180	looking at actual historical societies in all their complexity, where you have the
825220	828420	coexistence of different social forms.
829060	834900	You have the coexistence of state administratively
834900	840020	organized production, production directly under political control and managed by a
840020	845460	bureaucracy of some kind that's carrying out the coordination functions and the
846260	847220	control functions.
848020	851620	And those bureaucracies have existed for thousands of years.
852420	856900	You might just as well call some of the dynasties of ancient China
856900	861300	socialists because they were very large and sometimes very efficient.
862020	868180	Surprisingly, so if you look into that history, systems of coordination with legal structures,
868180	872020	which the Chinese ancient philosophers were concerned to elaborate.
872580	877220	And of course, they've existed in the modern world in recent centuries and they continue to exist.
878100	883700	So you take a country like China, for example, which has a large and important state sector,
883700	888500	but that state sector also has state-owned enterprises, SOEs,
889300	893300	which are often managed and run on a small scale.
893300	897700	They're managed locally, but they exist as state-owned enterprises.
898260	902260	And in the midst of that, you have capitalist enterprises competing with them.
902260	907300	As we know, there's been some resurgence of actual capitalist relations in China, plus
907300	914100	cooperatives, plus the international capitalist sector in special zones, where some regulations
914100	915780	apply to them and so forth and so on.
915780	918580	In other words, you have a huge mix of systems.
918580	926340	You have a mixed economy, to use a phrase from the Western political economy literature.
927700	934180	And if socialist relations are, to the extent that social relations are dominant there,
934180	936500	you might call it a socialist mixed economy.
936500	941780	In fact, that's what the Chinese Communist Party basically puts forward as its view of themselves,
941860	948260	the market economy, with Chinese market socialism, with Chinese characteristics,
948260	950580	you know the phraseology that they use.
952420	957780	And from my point of view, that is all on one side.
957780	964820	What the model, the MDIC model, as you named it, multi-level democratic iterative coordination,
965460	967060	is about is not that.
967060	971460	It's not about combination of different things in historical admixture
971460	975300	with all of the contradictions and complexities that accompany that.
975300	975800	Not that.
976420	986340	It's a model of the way core institutions in the modern socialist economy interact with one another
987220	990260	and mutually determine each other.
991460	994500	That is the central idea, what we'll be talking about in a little while.
994500	998100	That's the main thing I want to get to.
999060	1005380	The point, just to finish this up, about the stages, confusion that exists,
1006180	1014980	is that it has overtaken huge sectors, not just of the mainstream capitalist intellectual environment
1016340	1021220	where these people talk about mixed economies and institutions from here and there,
1021300	1029140	and the eclectic picture, transforming the complexity of the real world that they
1029140	1036100	observe into their theory directly with no organization, with no intervention on the part
1036100	1037060	of logic.
1038020	1040340	So you have the Cubans, for example.
1040340	1043620	They have their regular party congresses.
1043620	1048820	And obviously, discussion is going on all the time there, not just at the party congresses,
1048820	1053540	but it becomes very prominent at those periods when they wrestle with the question of what they
1053540	1054340	call reform.
1056260	1060660	The question is exactly the same as the Chinese question.
1060660	1066900	It's how can we mix socialism, I'm putting inverted commas, quotation marks around the word
1066900	1071860	socialism here, which means state production, state central planning, etc.
1071860	1078020	How can we mix that with just the right amount of, now quotation marks again, capitalism,
1079620	1085460	so that we get the advantages of capitalism, a spur to incentive, competition, dynamism.
1085460	1092020	That's what capitalism gives us, whereas the state sector gives us what we like from socialism,
1092740	1101460	security, equality, coordination, addressing the ecological problems which are always at the
1101460	1103780	forefront of our minds, those kinds of things.
1104180	1108980	How can we, so they're not talking about socialism, and I'm talking about the fundamental
1108980	1112500	levels of the Cuban leadership and of the Chinese leadership.
1113700	1119060	They're talking about a socialist capitalist mixed economy, the advantages of both.
1119060	1122660	And if you read their literature, that's very much the way the thinking goes.
1123540	1129220	Now, the implication of that is there's a one way highway with strong central planning,
1129940	1136580	state control at one end of the spectrum, and total deregulation market processes,
1136580	1139780	atomistic competition and so forth at the other end of the spectrum.
1140180	1141220	That's your spectrum.
1141220	1144420	And what we need is a mixed economy somewhere in the middle.
1146180	1151460	In some ways, it's not too different from the Keynesian conception within mainstream economics.
1153460	1159060	The mix of private and with the appropriate degree of state intervention or state intervention with
1159060	1163940	the appropriate mix of market competition in order to spice it up a little bit.
1163940	1165380	I think that's totally wrong.
1166020	1174100	I think MDIC and the other models that people have put forward is on a different dimension.
1174100	1181460	It's what the word, I'll just say perpendicular to, it's often in a different direction.
1181460	1182340	It's not that at all.
1183060	1188100	So if people say, and friends of mine in Cuba have said this, we need reform.
1189060	1190980	I say, well, reform in which direction?
1192980	1196020	In which direction are you going to reform?
1196820	1202820	And so multi-level democratic iterative coordination, if I can use my term,
1202820	1206260	the way I put it together, other people have different terms, of course,
1206260	1210900	is not somewhere on the spectrum between the market and central planning.
1210900	1213460	It's something completely different from it.
1214180	1220660	And that's the essential idea that I want to try to get across.
1221780	1222500	Yes, great.
1222500	1230260	And I mean, I can only highlight that we absolutely need an alternative because I mean,
1230260	1236820	it's not only, as you referenced, someone like Keynes who posits this as if there was only
1236820	1242020	hierarchical central planning or absolute atomistic market forces.
1242020	1249140	It's also Hayek who famously used this dichotomy as if it was only this or that.
1249140	1251540	And then we definitely have to transcend it.
1251540	1255860	And so I'm very happy to talk about exactly that with you today.
1255860	1257220	So let's get to your model.
1258020	1263060	Could you maybe as a start, give us a broad overview of multi-level
1263060	1265220	democratic iterative coordination?
1265220	1266660	What's the basic structure?
1266660	1269540	What are the basic assumptions and premises of your model?
1270500	1276980	Oh, when you take the concept of democratic planning, just take those two words.
1278180	1280260	An average person is going to scratch their head.
1280260	1283700	They're going to say, what in the world can you possibly be talking about?
1284340	1289220	Planning is creating something according to a single consistent vision.
1290100	1295780	When a painter plans a painting, he doesn't consult a whole roomful of people and say,
1295780	1297060	well, should I put a tree here?
1297700	1300900	Should I put a house there or a stream there?
1300900	1303860	The conception has to be kind of integral.
1303860	1307300	It's kind of almost inherently coordinated.
1307300	1309460	That's in the concept of planning.
1309460	1317060	Democracy, on the other hand, is a multitude of individual wills pulling in different directions.
1318020	1322660	Now, if you're not going to coordinate that with a market or with elections in the
1322660	1326420	political sphere, we'll just decide by having votes.
1327700	1334580	If you're not going to coordinate that way, how are you going to combine planning and democracy?
1336020	1340260	If people are involved in planning, they're going to say, well, someone's going to say,
1340260	1341300	I think we should do this.
1341300	1343300	And someone else is going to say, I think we should do that.
1344180	1346740	Well, what if this and that don't work, don't fit together?
1347300	1350580	Someone else is going to have to figure out a way to reconcile them.
1351220	1358740	It might take the form of a compromise or something is going to have to happen.
1361060	1365780	Anything you want to say about the constraints so that nobody's vital interests are threatened, sure.
1366820	1368660	We can obviously bring that on board.
1368660	1371380	But you still have a conflict.
1372740	1373860	This is the binary.
1373860	1378900	You referred to it before, the idea, and it's present in Hayek and the libertarian
1378900	1383220	thinkers at one end of the spectrum, plus the mixed economy people.
1383220	1384420	Everyone is worried about this.
1384420	1386580	But you never get away from that single dimension.
1387220	1390580	You never get away from that single idea that somehow we're going to have to
1391620	1395860	find some kind of a muddled up compromise in the middle if you want that.
1395860	1397940	If you're Hayek, you want to stay at one end.
1397940	1399460	But that's clear.
1401380	1404020	How are you going to do this?
1404180	1411620	The answer that emerged from the experience of first attempt socialist construction
1411620	1418420	in the 20th century is the iterative concept.
1418420	1420980	So I can start with that in answer to your question.
1420980	1426900	It was a central aspect of multi-level democratic iterative coordination.
1428820	1430900	The idea is really very simple.
1431700	1435220	The center, I'm going to speak of the center and the enterprise.
1435220	1437940	I'm going to speak of, first of all, I'm going to speak of two levels.
1437940	1443380	The model says multi-level, and that implies there could be more than two, which we could
1443380	1449460	analyze later, but I'll work with a simple conception of two levels, top and bottom,
1449460	1452580	center, and I don't want to say periphery.
1452580	1456260	That brings in another level of thinking.
1456260	1471300	The center essentially defines a brand plan for one of its enterprises, for all of its
1471300	1476900	enterprises, but we'll talk about a particular one, which is the basic nature of the enterprise,
1476900	1482660	the basic nature of its function, the kind of goods or services that it delivers
1484580	1485860	to the society as a whole.
1487220	1491940	And it says, this is what we see as your baseline.
1491940	1498500	Essentially, this is a point at which my model says the enterprise is not autonomous.
1499700	1507060	Now, there's an idea out there, which is another one of these unanalyzed terms that
1507060	1513300	people sometimes use a lot, self-management, and a lot of pro-socialist and socialist advocacy
1513700	1518020	people speak about self-management, and what we have to have is a lot of self-management.
1518020	1520980	If you analyze self-management, you have to ask, what does that mean?
1520980	1521860	Who is the self?
1523060	1525860	And of course, the self is a hierarchy of levels.
1525860	1528100	At one level, the self is a single individual.
1529860	1534500	At another level, the self is the society as a whole, but who speaks for the society as a whole?
1535300	1537220	And there are many intermediate levels.
1537220	1541780	There are sort of like non-governmental organizations.
1541780	1545620	There are stakeholders at middle levels of that process.
1545620	1549060	Some of the people you've been talking to and are continuing to talk to talk about
1549060	1552100	stakeholders a lot and stakeholder democracy.
1552100	1552600	Good.
1553220	1554420	So there are all these levels.
1556180	1559700	The enterprise belongs to society as a whole.
1560980	1565060	Society as a whole consists essentially, let's assume, of its working people.
1565060	1566660	It is the working class in power.
1567540	1568040	Okay.
1568900	1576740	We'll assume that remnants of the billionaire class are no longer a significant social force.
1576740	1577240	They're gone.
1578580	1582100	So everyone is working people, but with all differentiations within us,
1582980	1586420	different kinds of work and different levels.
1587220	1590180	But that's the overall social control of the enterprise.
1590180	1593140	So the first starting point is the enterprise can't simply
1594020	1599060	sell its assets and move to another country or change fields completely,
1599060	1603140	change from being in manufacturing production and move over to
1604180	1607220	services or agriculture or something else.
1608020	1611140	The enterprise has a defined role and it has certain
1612660	1614740	properties that have been devolved upon.
1614740	1617220	It means a production that are under its control
1617540	1623060	and which it is responsible to society for the management of.
1623860	1632820	So I guess the first point is the production units of our MDIC socialist economy are not
1632820	1641540	autonomous entities existing without any connection to the rest of themselves,
1641540	1643380	the rest of the economy.
1643540	1647540	And so that's the first level of control.
1648100	1653700	Now, from that point onward, the enterprises are responsible for determining their plan.
1654900	1662420	They're responsible for figuring out for the forthcoming period what they're going to do.
1664500	1671380	And this is the importance of the planning phase as well as the execution phase.
1671700	1678580	Planning in highly authoritarian systems like the capitalist one,
1680580	1684420	people say, don't worry about planning, it's the results that matter.
1685380	1690500	It even works its way into the epistemology of the economic theorists, positivism.
1691540	1693940	We're interested in results, don't worry about planning.
1693940	1696820	Planning sort of takes place in the head of the entrepreneur
1697540	1701780	and is kind of a fleeting moment that we can hardly analyze.
1703700	1710420	But a socialist conception sees planning and execution as two interrelated phases.
1710980	1716340	They aren't separate in time, although in early phases of 20th century planning often they were.
1716980	1722260	But the planning and execution are simultaneous but never merged into one another.
1722260	1726340	They flow into one another, but they have distinct qualities.
1727140	1733300	So you have a central body which essentially at the beginning of
1734020	1739140	what I'll call the planning phase of this process says, okay, get started.
1739140	1743300	And the key thing is that the enterprise is responsible for figuring that out.
1743300	1748500	The enterprise has to figure out what it will produce, the quantity of output that it's going
1748500	1753940	to target, the assortment of that output, the quality of the output, the measures of quality,
1754900	1761460	the intended, a rough idea of the intended recipients of the output, where the demand
1761460	1767380	will come from, how the output will be distributed to either other producers or final
1768580	1772180	stores for distribution to consumers.
1773860	1776420	The enterprise will have to figure out its technology plan.
1777220	1781780	It'll have to figure out what resources it wants to devote to technical progress.
1782740	1787060	It'll have to make organizational goals and set them.
1789220	1790580	It'll have to do all these things.
1791460	1796740	And then that will require a lot of interactions with the rest of the economy
1796740	1798900	because there's a great deal of division of labor.
1800340	1805540	And therefore there will have to be exchange in the raw sense that goods will have to move
1805540	1810180	from one producing unit to another, goods and resources of all different kinds,
1810180	1815700	including human resources, will have to be shared out and allocated and coordinated.
1817300	1823860	So the enterprise, when it produces its plan, has all sorts of implicit demands upon the rest
1823860	1828660	of society, raw materials that it needs, our sources, et cetera, et cetera.
1830500	1837460	And in the next round of this iterative process, the center has to take all that and say,
1837460	1838900	does it fit or doesn't it fit?
1840180	1844100	And you can think of this momentarily in a very simple supply and demand way,
1846740	1848740	which is an element of the whole picture.
1848740	1851220	It isn't the whole picture, but it is an element.
1852500	1856180	Is the total amount of a certain grade of steel
1858260	1863060	that is being demanded by all the enterprises for the work that they intend to carry out
1863780	1868340	equal to the amount of steel that the steel industry is slated to produce?
1870180	1872020	Has slated itself to produce.
1872020	1875300	And if those two numbers don't match, then you have a coordination problem.
1875860	1880740	And so we'll try to solve that problem by allocating additional resources to steel,
1880740	1889380	by finding workarounds, or by scaling back the production plans of the other enterprises.
1890180	1896180	And so it's a vast interconnected network that has to be rendered consistent.
1896980	1901060	Now you can render it consistent in the abstract by solving a system of equations.
1902580	1903940	There are millions of equations.
1904580	1908500	And then we get into the old millions of equations critique of socialism.
1908500	1910340	It's really a critique of central planet.
1911460	1914740	The central planners just don't have the information
1914740	1916660	and they don't have the technology to do it.
1916660	1917140	They can't.
1917780	1918500	It's too big.
1921300	1922980	And so we have to let the market do it.
1922980	1924020	That's the old binary.
1924980	1926340	That's the old way of thinking.
1927380	1933940	In the iterative way of thinking, the center sends modified plans back to the enterprise
1933940	1939780	based upon the enterprise's original plans, but with certain modifications.
1939780	1944100	Now the center's right to make those modifications is part of the conception.
1944820	1949860	The enterprise, as I said, is not an autonomous, self-managing entity
1951300	1952740	apart from any constraints.
1953700	1955780	And it's an old philosophical debate.
1957860	1961060	Does freedom boil down entirely to absence of constraint?
1963940	1966900	And Marx and Engels wrote about this, Engels particularly,
1966900	1974260	in an essay which was called On Authority and several other things that one could look at.
1974260	1975300	That's really important.
1977380	1982500	So the enterprise now has a modified plan, but along the lines of its original plan
1982500	1986820	because it signals its intentions by sending that plan up.
1987620	1990820	And so now, not having to start from fresh, from scratch,
1991460	1997060	the enterprise can make the necessary modifications and send the information back up.
1998340	2003780	Now in sending information up that way in each round or each iteration,
2004340	2006180	it's a crucial concept in the whole model.
2006260	2014980	So in each iteration, the enterprise sends information up to the top.
2014980	2021060	The enterprise is revealing its actual potentials, its actual capacities to do things.
2021700	2023780	And it is using its local knowledge.
2024660	2028100	So here again, we get a concept from Hayek, right?
2029220	2032740	And Hayek used the idea of local knowledge
2033220	2037300	as a way of attacking the very concept of central planning.
2040020	2049380	But the iterative conception is a stage by stage coordination of local wills and general wills.
2050020	2055220	You know, the general interest of society is expressed in the central plan.
2055220	2057700	That's a crucial idea in this.
2057940	2059140	That's a crucial idea in this.
2061300	2065700	And in principle, and I emphasize in principle,
2065700	2068900	because there's where the reply from the libertarians could come.
2068900	2072100	You know, what you can do in principle, you can't do in practice.
2072100	2072820	But I'll say it.
2072820	2074020	I'll say it in principle.
2074980	2079700	If the enterprise is incentivized to do it, if the enterprise has the incentive,
2080260	2085140	it can put its local resources and its local knowledge unknown to the center,
2085140	2091460	its particularities into the process and therefore send back to the center
2091460	2099540	in the form of its next round of proposals precise, accurate, detailed knowledge,
2099540	2101780	not only of what exists at the local level,
2101780	2107060	but what the local level thinks could potentially exist if it mobilizes its resources,
2107700	2114260	if it mobilizes its collectives and sets itself an ambitious project
2114980	2118020	for technical transformation.
2118020	2120100	And then that goes back to the center.
2120100	2124820	So the center keeps on getting corrected, better information.
2125940	2128660	And on the basis of that, better information puts together
2128660	2133300	one more iteration of a consistent plan and sends that back down.
2135140	2137460	And the enterprise can then work with that.
2138020	2144660	If each iteration results in a plan that's less different from the preceding one
2144660	2148420	than the time before, so that the plan is progressively getting,
2148980	2154420	in other words, what the enterprise gets back is more like what it said the last time.
2154420	2156340	And the same at the level of the center.
2156340	2159860	The center is constantly getting back from all the enterprises
2161220	2164500	a picture which is closer and closer to consistency.
2164980	2167860	Then the plan is said to be converging.
2168580	2171940	And that's where the word convergence comes in.
2171940	2175540	And work is being done and has done, it was done in the 20th century,
2175540	2186100	mainly in the socialist countries, the countries where this was a practical matter,
2186100	2192420	not just something that a few academics like me batted around, you know,
2193220	2196340	but they were really working on this.
2196340	2199300	The idea is how long will convergence take
2199300	2201860	and how efficient can the convergence process be?
2203060	2205540	So that if eventually you get convergence,
2205540	2209460	what you get is a plan which is not merely a political compromise,
2209460	2214260	as it's sometimes thought of in a mixed economy kind of a situation,
2214260	2218340	but something that everyone will have been involved in producing.
2219140	2224100	And there you have the potential to draw workers into the production process.
2224980	2233140	In other words, you have people being drawn into planning, conceiving
2236020	2244580	what our work is going to accomplish, you know, and jobs become not just jobs, you know.
2245380	2253300	You get to a situation where qualitatively, the workplace experience is not just an experience
2253300	2257860	of being an instrument of someone else's will for a period of time during the day,
2257860	2265060	in exchange for which you receive wages, creating a separation between a production sphere
2265060	2267700	and a consumption sphere, they're totally separate, you know,
2267700	2271780	but you gradually get the meaningful integration of this.
2271780	2277940	And that's a goal. Now, if you want to talk about something socialism is supposed to mean,
2278980	2283940	it's supposed to mean that. It's supposed to mean that people actually begin to experience
2284980	2290260	practically control over their own lives and theoretically in the sense that they're not just
2290820	2297060	carrying out orders and so forth and fitting into a scheme of things,
2297060	2303460	and fitting into a scheme of things, which everyone has to do. I mean, that's necessary
2303460	2308100	if the whole system is going to work, but that they understand the way the scheme works
2308740	2316100	and participate in making it happen. And I'll just say that my way of interpreting the great
2316100	2321460	legacy of Marx and Engels, you know, and their followers, everyone else who has come along
2322420	2329620	since then, is that they created a view of socialism, which was not that it's something
2329620	2337460	that strikes in one moment in time, like a bolt from heaven. You know, socialism is not a
2338660	2348180	miraculous occurrence, a kind of biblical event, but it's something that has to be built. You want
2348180	2353780	to talk about the working class in power. You have to have people with sufficient education,
2353780	2361860	sufficient political consciousness, sufficient fundamental human resources, people and their
2361860	2369460	institutions. Okay. And so that's part of it. We'll get more in a moment into the actual
2369460	2377940	organization of MDIC. Yeah. And we will definitely get also to the point that you just touched upon
2378020	2382820	at the end, which would be somehow related to the question of transition and transformation,
2382820	2390660	but we will kind of push it a little bit further to the end. Before we get there. I mean, there was
2390660	2397620	a lot in there when you just described the basic outline of the model. And I would have a couple
2397620	2404420	of questions actually that might serve as a follow-up. And I mean, one of the initial
2404420	2409140	questions would be the starting point where you said, all right, we have this center, which will
2409140	2417620	come up with a like first idea of a basic plan, which will, as you just pointed out, not be a
2417620	2425940	detailed plan because the detailed planning will be what the enterprises are going to do. But what
2425940	2434500	will be the basis of the, you spoke of a grand plan that the center provides in the first place?
2434500	2442100	So what are the components that this plan is based upon? And yeah, maybe let's just leave it
2442100	2450020	there. What's the basic starting point when it comes to that? Okay. It boils down to what is
2450020	2459780	the center there for? What is the role of the center? And every question is a big question,
2459780	2469620	but that's a big question. I'll try to be as brief as possible. The first point is we want to avoid
2469620	2479700	another conceptual miscue that is often present in people's thinking about this. People associate
2479700	2485540	democracy with the lower levels, the local levels. If you have people participating in planning,
2485540	2491220	they're participating at their enterprise, at their workplace, for example. They're not
2491220	2496980	participating over there. I would like to emphasize that what I'm calling the center
2498980	2506500	is also a site for democratic participation. And I mean this in two different ways. Now,
2506500	2511780	first of all, we have to be clear. If we're talking about a society with several hundred million
2511780	2518420	people, a huge country, I mean, countries are different sizes or at least dozens of millions
2520180	2526500	of people in a country of a reasonable size. We can't talk about everybody cramming into a
2526500	2533940	room and participating in the decision by raising their hands and exercising a democratic voice in
2533940	2541140	that direct democracy sense. We can't imagine a town meeting democracy on the level of a modern
2541140	2547220	country. And no one is trying to do that. So government will be representative.
2548820	2555060	And how representation is secured, whether by vote, whether by lottery,
2556180	2562180	there is a proposal for doing it by lottery. I don't follow that line of thinking myself.
2562180	2566340	I'm not convinced about that, but it's part of the debate, and it should be,
2568100	2571940	is another question that would have to be worked out. But you have
2575300	2581780	a system of democratic control in sort of formal sense. But I'm talking about more than that. I'm
2581780	2589780	talking about a culture of critical democracy surrounding central planning. Now, modern
2589780	2596660	technology plays a role in that. We have the internet. A central planning board doesn't have
2596660	2602340	to be a distant place. It doesn't have to be somewhere far away in a capital city, which is
2602340	2609300	thousands of miles from where I live, let's say, and where people do things that I have no control over.
2612100	2617060	Needless to say, in the 20th century, in the socialist economies of the 20th century,
2617860	2623860	there were quite a few instances of situations like that. It was a highly mixed
2624980	2633780	sort of situation. But it's a process, just as I said before, in relation to
2633780	2640660	worker participation. These things are processes, but it's also a process, the participation of the
2640660	2648100	worker citizen in central planning, at the level of central planning, where a certain degree of
2648100	2653940	openness of the process itself. In other words, the evolving plan doesn't have to be something,
2655540	2661620	let's say, a certain stage of the central plan moving toward consistency along the path of
2661620	2666900	convergence. You have a central plan. You don't have to wait until it's announced.
2667460	2672260	You can read it on the internet. You can go on the central planning website
2672260	2677380	and you can see what it is. And then there will be enormous critical commentary on that.
2680260	2685060	I like to say we're talking about central planning within the sites of the bloggers
2685060	2693060	and the cartoonists and the critical process in society as a whole. This would be part of the
2693060	2700260	culture of central as well as de-central levels of planning so that
2704740	2709380	quality has got to be part of our deliberations. Now, that having been said, what does the
2709380	2717540	central planning do? Because I think what your question actually was, well, first of all, it
2718500	2726260	achieves overall coordination, but that's just part of it. Beyond that, it organizes
2726260	2735380	the discussion of planning as such. Now, you'll notice that I use the term
2735380	2740660	multi-level democratic iterative coordination. I used the word coordination at the end of that
2740820	2748020	little acronym, MDIC. I didn't call it multi-level democratic iterative planning,
2748580	2755700	and I had a reason for that. I think the word planning has a connotation that ought to be
2755700	2763620	preserved. It's planning for the future. It's forward-looking planning, and that is not just
2763620	2769700	the problem of how do we put the puzzle together now, but how do we think about the way we
2770660	2777620	want our society and eventually our societies, think of a global level, to evolve in the decades
2777620	2785940	to come? Foremost there is the question of sustainability, the question of how do we want
2785940	2798500	to evolve human activity in a way that enhances and protects the Earth's environment and the ultimate
2798500	2807380	constraint, the limitation of planetary resources available to us. I won't talk about
2807380	2812980	Star Trek and the Federation of Planets or anything. That's science fiction or speculative
2812980	2818660	fiction, so we'll leave that for the future, but right now we're talking about planet Earth and
2818660	2826660	its limited resources and so forth. A view to the future, a long time horizon, is very central to
2826660	2832100	what a central planning element within the overall planning process, not central planning,
2833460	2840980	but the central component within a dynamic iterative process. That is something that
2840980	2846740	the central planning component can contribute, a sense of the long time horizon, of the need to
2847380	2853940	protect the Earth from global warming and the need to protect the ozone layer. I can go on,
2854580	2861380	but there's a huge literature on this and this aspect is very important. Those constraints
2861380	2867220	involve studying the interaction among the activities of all of the economies and all
2867220	2871860	of the local units of all of the economies together. In principle, this cannot be done
2872500	2878580	at the local level. This is something that can't be, obviously people everywhere can have opinions
2878580	2883700	on it and should have those opinions expressed and the critical deliberative process should be
2883700	2890660	taking place. There's no question about that, but this is something that can only be worked into
2890660	2897460	meaningful long-term plans, dynamic future-oriented plans at a level which coordinates,
2898820	2904820	has a coordinating perspective for the overall, so that's one thing, major thing, that central
2904820	2911780	planning can do. There's also something that's very hard, we need to do a lot of background
2911780	2916100	on this and I'd need to do a lot of background for myself because I'm teaching it to myself
2917300	2924740	over the years, but I want to say something very controversial about prices. There is a
2924740	2931780	widespread idea that we can develop some kind of optimal prices, the best prices,
2932180	2940580	but that if we do, what we will be doing is imitating what exists in a general equilibrium
2940580	2948420	of competitive markets, that the market model is the model for what the price vector, that is
2948420	2954900	the list of all the prices, ordered list in the economy, what that should look like, what the
2954900	2960740	should look like, what the internal proportions in that list will be, is somehow
2964340	2972260	planning something that is what a spontaneous market mechanism with either socialist or
2972260	2980100	capitalist property relations regardless, a market mechanism unplanned would accomplish
2980820	2986980	and I think that's wrong. I think there are socialist production prices, if you like,
2989300	2993700	I call them social reproduction prices and work that I've done on this,
2996420	2997700	which would incorporate
2998660	3007460	actual quantitative calculations of price relations that are determined by social
3009460	3014420	relations forces, things going on in the social relations of society, such as, for example,
3014420	3022500	the ecological considerations, which no spontaneous mechanism involving interaction among
3022660	3030660	uncoordinated entities, resulting in convergence towards some kind of equilibrium prices
3030660	3037380	can possibly accomplish, it just can't do it. So one of the things a central planning board
3038340	3044420	would be responsible for is the massive problem of calculating optimal prices for purposes of
3044500	3051540	prices for purposes of calculation, income formation, decision making,
3053140	3056740	and I'm taking the point of view and it's a controversial point of view in the socialist
3056740	3060660	spectrum and some people say all of that is capitalist thinking, you shouldn't be thinking
3060660	3066740	that way at all, that you shouldn't be thinking about, first of all, you shouldn't be thinking
3066740	3070900	about optimality, you shouldn't be thinking about finding the best ways of doing anything
3071540	3078340	that's foreign to socialist thinking, I don't believe that, I believe
3079780	3085860	optimization in that sense is too important to be left to capitalist property owners,
3085860	3092340	when the workers own the resources of society and are in charge of its legacy, are in charge of
3092900	3099060	what we become, you know, that responsibility weighs heavily on the shoulders of people who
3099060	3105940	have to actually make decisions and carry it out and they have to do it the best way that can be
3105940	3112020	done in the name of all the people whose blood sweat and tears are congealed in all of those
3112020	3117300	resources that we have, you know, and the futures and whose children and grandchildren depend upon
3117300	3126100	upon that and that's a very important element of socialist leadership. So it's another thing that
3126100	3131620	a central planning board would have to do. So finally, I'll just end with a very short one,
3132500	3140580	a central planning board has got to address taking into account the entire background
3140580	3148180	democratic debate and all the information that's flowing into them all of the more near-term issues
3148180	3153460	about how society should develop, how should we arrange the relationship between production
3153460	3160660	and residential spaces? You know, it's an old question, but clearly an obviously relevant one
3160660	3167620	will continue to be, should we put factories and homes close together, save on commuting time,
3168660	3176340	you know, but there are obvious environmental pollution issues, you know, should people have
3176340	3183060	to live near sources of environmental pollution, noise pollution, environmental pollution, you know,
3183300	3191300	particulates in the air, anything like that, you know, or should we separate production locations
3191300	3196420	and residences, put them miles apart from one another, you know, then we can create nice
3196420	3202500	residential enclaves which don't have to see the factories and the stores and the offices, you know,
3202500	3210100	but we create enormous commuting problems, burdens on the transportation network. How do we work out
3210100	3218660	consumption, production, residence, transportation, how do we get all these networks,
3219460	3224980	water, power, you know, obviously the technology is improving and the trade-offs are getting better,
3224980	3232580	you know, over time, unless ecological problems, you know, tightening environmental constraints
3232580	3237220	are working in the opposite direction, but all of this has to be put together and it has to be
3237220	3244180	thought through and has to be eventually transmitted into viable five-year, ten-year,
3244180	3251540	fifteen-year, thirty-year plans, you know, which reflect the formation of a democratic consensus,
3251540	3256820	they reflect the best that technology can give us and they reflect the overall balance of resources
3256820	3264180	and these are problems that can't be solved at a local level. The local level participates in them,
3264180	3271380	but the local level can't, you can't have 10 million separate plans to address
3271380	3276180	the problem of human interaction with the environment over the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years,
3276180	3283140	can't happen. That's the central component and some of the things which it has to do.
3284500	3293460	Let's try to pick this apart a little bit at least because oftentimes when, also when reading
3293460	3298820	a text and now when hearing your elaborations, I mostly agree with the overall sentiment,
3298820	3304820	but there are like huge question marks in terms of how can this be done? So, when it comes to
3304820	3312900	the question of what kind of information would the center need to have in order to be able to
3312900	3319220	make these decisions that you think the center should do and which I would largely agree with
3319220	3325860	that this would be a problem of collective problem solving and not only a domestic one
3325860	3332820	because certain topics cannot be addressed as you clearly pointed out on a decentralized level alone,
3333460	3340500	but what is the flow of information? So, I need to come back to this question. If you state that
3341460	3347940	the center, for example, will have to calculate, I think they are called price lists, which include
3347940	3355940	social reproduction prices for broad categories of goods as I understand it, then what would be
3355940	3363220	the informational basis on top of which this would be calculated and you also explained that it would
3363220	3369460	not only be a parametric part which needs to be considered, but also a very social one that needs
3369460	3375860	to be considered and it needs to flow into these forms of calculation done by the center, but I
3375860	3382740	think it is of crucial importance first to ask, okay, what's the information, the exact information
3382740	3391300	that flows into it? If you do not have, for example, prices for consumer goods or something
3391300	3399860	like that that will serve as an indicator, for example, and then how would a meaningful
3399860	3410340	participation of the enterprises as well as the rest of society, how can this be facilitated in
3410340	3418100	order to not end up in a situation where the people that receive these quote unquote directions
3418100	3426580	from the center do not perceive it as external to themselves, but do like legitimately feel it
3426660	3432420	as something that they took part in creating. I mean, this is a very crucial element and I think
3432420	3440420	it's something that you are very much interested in that people will be able to participate in this
3440420	3448820	forming of plans, but you will have this kind of difficult question to answer how it can be done
3448820	3455380	that it is not like too many meetings problem, as you just stated, it's not possible to have like
3455380	3463140	20 million people deciding on this, but still have people left with a reasonable
3465220	3473300	way to take part in this overall coordination. So how do you approach this kind of difficult problem,
3473300	3482260	I guess? Well, I think you're asking me a question which can only be answered
3482820	3488180	historically, it can only be answered by the process of history unfolding itself. I think
3489220	3494660	you're asking the kind of the working question, which isn't going to have a simple answer with
3494660	3505620	the capital A, it's to an ordinary, we always use this word ordinary, but a rank and file
3506580	3510980	socialist and socially conscious and socialist educated working person
3512100	3518900	in an enterprise, a price list is announced and is available on the internet,
3520660	3532020	which is a very big now in price theory, you discover and there was a lot of work done
3532580	3541700	in the Soviet Union and other eastern countries about this. If the price list is a sort of a core
3541700	3551300	than an enterprise can apply for variations based upon detailed things. My general point is that
3553460	3558180	the person working in an enterprise can say, okay, these are the prices we have to work with,
3558180	3564340	we just take them, we take them parametrically, we just say these are the prices and we don't
3564340	3569220	need to be concerned with how they were constructed, but they don't have to do that,
3571460	3578020	they can understand the theory behind it, they can understand something. Now, there's obviously
3578020	3585300	on different levels, I'm not necessarily assuming that every worker in a production
3585540	3593700	plant at an enterprise is going to be able to independently solve the matrix equations,
3593700	3601220	which result in the formation of a certain set of optimal prices, but they will have come up
3601220	3609780	through the education system and the ongoing education system, the process of political and
3610660	3616660	political economic education that's part of being in a socialist enterprise, it's part of existence
3616660	3624180	in that enterprise, they will acquire some sense of the underlying principles and they will know
3624180	3631540	something about that and they will have read the equivalent of popular science articles,
3631860	3641540	which explain and transmit as much of this. One of the goals in this integration of planning and
3642420	3653300	execution as two phases of human activity, really, is to break down those barriers, to
3653460	3658820	to create the greatest possibility for rational understanding,
3660740	3665860	as the sociologist Mannheim, Karl Mannheim, would have said years ago,
3668260	3673300	rational understanding rather than merely functional understanding. Now,
3673300	3677300	we have functional understanding of a lot of things, I personally have only functional
3677300	3682820	understanding of this computer that I'm talking to you on and what you do to move around on it,
3683300	3691940	I wish I were more of a techie, but I'm not, and we struggle with that, but in all fair
3691940	3697060	phases of life, we want to understand and especially when it comes not to the technical
3697060	3702740	things, where we understand that better, but when it comes to the social side, when it comes to
3703620	3709540	actually knowing how human relations are managed and that we're part of that,
3710180	3716740	you know, we aren't just recipients of it, we have a role to play in grasping it
3718260	3722740	theoretically, not just practically. But beyond that, it's hard to say,
3722740	3726420	you know, it would depend on and it will be very different in different places and times,
3727220	3733300	you know, different, I don't think there's a simple formula that can answer that one,
3733300	3740260	it has to be answered practically. And I mean, quite a huge part of this relation,
3741300	3747380	specifically when it comes to enterprises and the center, is the question of,
3748660	3755380	I think you posed it as the question of incentives before, I mean, because at some point,
3756900	3762100	the question comes into mind that you have this iterative process and the center sends some
3762180	3768100	initial prices for broad categories and then you have the detailed planning by the enterprises
3768100	3775540	and the enterprises then are expected to submit truthful information. So, I mean, as we know,
3775540	3780820	this was a problem in the Soviet Union, so this was not truthful information because we had the
3780820	3788900	perverse incentive problem, so to speak, where the enterprises did have a incentive to kind of
3788900	3795860	hoard stuff because they knew that they would get like way too hard goals to manage and so they
3795860	3802500	were hoarding, et cetera, et cetera. So, you will have in this iterative process, the question of
3802500	3807620	what's the incentive for the enterprises to give back truthful information in order to make the
3807620	3812820	whole thing work because if they do not, then it kind of implodes, so to speak, because it won't
3812820	3819060	work and related to that is the question of what will be the reward for the given enterprise.
3819060	3828100	So, I think there's a, I think you call it, let me take a look, socialist rate of return
3828100	3834180	and as far as I understood it, this would be a kind of rate at which
3836020	3841300	enterprises would be allowed to profit, quote unquote, from the whole thing. Maybe I got that
3841300	3849860	wrong, but I would be interested in this constellation. How do the given enterprises,
3850820	3860660	how are they incentivized to do as they are told, quote unquote, plus being semi-autonomous in
3861860	3870740	being effective in actually producing the stuff and not wasting resources and then truthfully
3870740	3877540	reporting back and taking part in the iterative process? So, what's the gist to all of that?
3877540	3880660	Because it needs to be a collaboration and not an opposition.
3881700	3888260	Well, wow. These are questions which could take a long time to answer and I want to try to...
3889060	3894020	But they're central, I guess. I mean, for me, it's absolutely central to understand the model.
3894980	3896580	I'm sorry if it's too...
3896580	3904740	One thing, no, don't be sorry. Very good. One thing, I'll break it into two parts. I'm trying
3904740	3909860	to figure out which part to do first. I'm going to do the reverse order. I want to take the
3909860	3917700	incentive. That's part of your question, which is very good. So, you have this iterative process
3918340	3922340	and we're somehow assuming that the enterprise is going to get together and is going to make
3922340	3930260	truthful reports of the resources it controls and is not going to manipulate the process for
3930260	3935300	its own strategic purposes. I think that's key and there was a huge literature in the Soviet Union
3935300	3941620	about deformations that resulted from exactly that kind of behavior, which is exactly what you'd
3941620	3949700	expect at the stage of development that existed there. Then you'd hardly, from a serious materialist
3949700	3955620	point of view, expect anything else to happen. You had people... How did Marx put it? He says,
3955620	3961460	society only come into existence stamped with the birthmarks of the society from which they emerge.
3962740	3972100	This is a process. We understand that. So, how do we address strategic distorting behavior on the
3972100	3981700	part of local entities, enterprises or whatever? First, I want to mention there's a whole literature
3981700	3990420	on that, which I believe was in some ways stimulated by the economic reform in the
3990420	3997300	Soviet Union. Back in the 1960s, the Lieberman reforms, as they're called in the West, which
3997300	4003540	essentially amounted to setting up something like at least an early stage of an iterative process
4004420	4012100	that MDIC focuses on, where the enterprises were told, we will no longer be sending you detailed
4012100	4018580	plans. We will be sending you a few overall control figures. Within that, you need to work out
4019620	4025300	the detailed plans. You need to do a complete accounting for your resources and
4025620	4031860	a specification of how you're going to change methods of production and what you're going to
4031860	4038740	do. Was that successful or unsuccessful? It's a long, complicated story. I want to skip over it,
4038740	4049860	but it gave rise to the incentive design literature, which a number of European scholars...
4050580	4054820	There was a large French component, an economist by the name of Tirol,
4056500	4064820	and a number of Americans also participated in that. How can you devise truth-telling
4064820	4077220	incentive mechanisms? Essentially, I have an answer. I'm not going to try to
4077700	4082260	elaborate it too much, because we don't even have visuals. We only have sound,
4083220	4087940	and even to the extent that I understand it, which is that I've been able to take it.
4090740	4098420	I think in the usual thinking about this, there's another binary, another one of these
4098420	4104420	either-or kind of situations. In this case, the either-or is that people say,
4104900	4113540	some mathematical economists say, either you assume that people are socially motivated and
4115140	4124740	have high moral values and will simply act in the public interest because that's the kind of people
4124740	4130660	they are. You assume glorious people out of whom you will build a glorious society, or you have
4130980	4138900	to give up. Those are the two alternatives. The only kind of incentives you can possibly
4138900	4143700	have that make sense are market incentives where people are actually made to suffer for bad
4143700	4149700	decisions. If we don't produce efficiently, the business will go out of existence and the workers
4149700	4157060	will be fired and so forth and so on. That's control. You can't do it anyway. You can't provide
4157060	4163540	people with an incentive to act in the social interest. You don't have to provide them with
4163540	4170180	an incentive to act in their personal interest. That's human nature. They'll do that by themselves.
4171700	4177940	Is there an answer to that? I believe there is, and it resides in something I call,
4178900	4183860	that's a complicated phrase, but I'll give it to you because then I'll be able to refer to it.
4184820	4193940	The collective morale function. Let me set an environment to explain this. There's an enterprise
4195380	4201860	and the enterprise is required to form a plan. The enterprise personnel sit around a table,
4201860	4206260	the enterprise director and some of his technical people and some other people,
4206260	4210420	representatives of each of the departments of the enterprise, some kind of a little group that,
4210420	4218900	as best as possible under now given circumstances, represents the enterprise. What should we do?
4221940	4225700	The enterprise, I'll just use a term, say the enterprise director
4228420	4231940	has a problem. Let's say he's in charge of this meeting. He sets the agenda.
4232740	4249220	He or she can set a target and say, this is what we're going to achieve. I'll put a number on it,
4249220	4255940	a target of 100. We're going to set a target of 100. The question is, is that the best the enterprise
4255940	4263460	can do? In order to find that out, this director is going to have to consult the people in the
4263460	4266980	enterprise. He's going to have to say, okay, people, do you want to roll up your sleeves
4266980	4273460	and really get to work? Do we want to really make a run at transforming ourselves into something a
4273460	4279940	little bit different from what we've been and really improve the way we work? This can mean
4279940	4285540	the level of output. It can mean many other things as well. I'll get to that part. That's
4285540	4292500	the second part. Are we really going to do this? Are we going to push ourselves to the practical
4292500	4304340	limit? If we do, then let's say that's 100. Now, if we do a little less than that, it's 95, 96.
4304340	4310180	If we do more, it's 103, 104, 105, that kind of thing. That's an index number
4310740	4318900	that we can use to measure our level of performance. Now, here's the collective
4318900	4326820	morale function. It says that when you have an enterprise in a society that is technologically
4326820	4334660	and educationally and socialistically advanced, we have a society of very intelligent, committed,
4334660	4341780	working people. We are not talking about people who trudge unwillingly into work every morning
4341780	4347300	and do what they're told, take a list from their supervisor, pay you to do this, this, and this,
4347300	4354180	and you carry out those tasks, go home, buy groceries with your wages, and come back the
4354180	4361220	next day. We're beyond that. We have a society where in order to achieve something, you really
4361300	4368260	have to have people motivated to do it. People really have to be involved. You have to bring
4368260	4381060	your teams on board, so to speak. Now, suppose the enterprise director is a very ambitious person
4382100	4386420	and wants to make a real good impression on his or her superiors,
4386980	4395780	and says, the information coming from all my colleagues is that our best level of achievement
4395780	4407060	is 100. I'm going to push for 103. Let's see if we can get it up to 103. This is the kind of person
4407060	4416260	who's really a rouser, a very, very high taught planning kind of a person, a person who is going
4416260	4424820	to try to push the enterprise. Let's suppose the actual effect of that has a demoralizing component
4424820	4431940	to it. Let's suppose people are going to sigh and say, okay, well, I guess we can put in some overtime
4431940	4436420	and I guess we can rework all these procedures that we have and I guess we can recalculate
4436420	4443220	everything. We can go over everything, but it's really impinging on other areas of life
4444100	4448740	for your staff, for the people around you. It's tough. This is not an easy thing to do.
4449300	4455700	What the collective morale function says is that as a result of pushing beyond 100
4456580	4463060	and calling for 103, what you'll only get is 102. In other words, you'll get people to do a little
4463060	4471300	more, but various forms of conscious and even unconscious resistance will develop.
4473060	4478420	What you will get, I need you to imagine a sort of a line. I realize I can't put anything on a
4478420	4487460	chalkboard. A horizontal line at a level of 100 and then a curve which touches that line at 100.
4487460	4493140	It's below the line. It touches at 100 and falls off in either direction. It's like a
4493140	4502100	downward-facing parabola. It just rises to 100 at a certain point at 100 and then falls off.
4503300	4511220	You see? If you push too far in the upward direction, you will get an increase,
4511220	4518740	but you won't get the increase you push for. Similarly, and this is where the other side is,
4518740	4523940	suppose you get an enterprise director who wants to game the system and wants to go for less than
4523940	4532740	100. This is the concealing reserves case, which was talked about in the old Soviet literature,
4532740	4541460	where an enterprise director would have an incentive to try to achieve a plan which is
4541460	4549620	less than 100. In the iterative MDIC context, he would want to announce a plan less than 100
4549620	4560980	and wants to announce a plan of 97, let's say. Once again, what's going to happen is that
4561380	4567220	that is also going to be demoralizing because people are saying, this enterprise director
4568180	4575620	is not asking us to do what we really can do, as much as we really can do. This enterprise director
4575620	4582420	is asking us to do less than that. Maybe we'll take a cue from that and we'll just cut back a
4583380	4594100	little bit more. Instead of 97, you would get 96. Again, part of the collective morale function.
4595140	4599940	In other words, the central idea is that under modern conditions,
4599940	4615380	moral matters. For morale to be invoked, for a collective to achieve a certain high level of
4615380	4624500	functioning in its own terms, it has to know that it's doing the best it can do. But the best
4624500	4629380	doesn't mean the most. It doesn't mean the farthest out along that line, as we can possibly go. What
4629380	4638900	we need to do is we need to get it... In other words, the point of a collective morale function,
4638900	4646100	if it exists, is that the actual need to motivate your collective, the actual need to put people
4646100	4653780	into motion, to make things happen well, and to get people to reveal their own reserves and to
4653780	4661700	come forward with suggestions and interventions and activities. The way to accomplish that is
4662740	4671380	to be truthful. And if you're not truthful, the forces around you will undermine you
4673060	4682180	to some degree. Now that idea, if it's true, if I can justify it,
4683940	4688260	and if anybody ever pays any attention to it, there will be many attacks against it,
4689220	4695380	it'll be contested. And in a certain sense, from my point of view, it should be, because if it isn't
4695380	4707140	solid, it won't hold, is the essential guarantee of the MDIC system. In other words, the center
4707940	4713860	can count on the enterprise to do approximately the best it can and therefore to send good
4713860	4722020	information up and enhance its contribution to the overall planning process. Because if it doesn't do
4722020	4732020	that, its own moral energy will be sacked, its own moral energy will be undermined.
4732020	4743300	And to the extent that that's true, it's not, many people may interpret this as
4745060	4752260	saying that you're relying on the goodwill or the high moral fiber of individuals,
4752980	4759860	the way the old critique of decentralized planning had it. But I don't think that's what I'm doing.
4760500	4765460	I hope that's not what I'm doing. I hope what I'm saying is that the enterprise, which means the
4765460	4769220	people themselves, I speak of the director, but he's speaking for everybody knows this,
4769220	4775700	everybody sitting around that table knows what the situation is. If we don't work ourselves to
4775700	4781780	our reasonable best level, and if we don't participate in the planning process in a
4781780	4790180	principled way, not in a strategic undermining way, then we're not going to feel good about
4790180	4793540	ourselves. And if we don't feel good about ourselves, we won't do the work that we need
4793540	4800980	to do. We will be undermining our own work. Here it is in a single folksy expression,
4800980	4806900	the last thing I'll say, okay, get another question from you. If it's worth doing,
4806900	4814420	it's worth doing well. And you hear workers say that. There are even writers who talk about the
4814420	4821940	invisible heart. That term has been used in a number of different ways. But my point is that
4822980	4829140	the ultimate blue, which holds so-called market system together, is that there's an underlying
4829140	4836900	moral foundation to incentives, which can't be gotten away from. And I'm relying on it here as
4836900	4849060	well. Well, I mean, I would say it's based on a lot of assumptions for sure. But it's based on
4849060	4855220	assumptions that I personally kind of favor, I would say, because at the end, it's not about
4855300	4864580	like relatively dumb economic incentivation, which I always think of not really holding up.
4864580	4873860	Because if I look at myself, for example, I always found being forced to earn money for living
4874500	4881060	is like one of the biggest obstacles for me in trying to pursue things that I'm good at,
4881060	4887780	actually. So I personally like this approach, that it's not so much about economic incentives.
4888500	4894820	I'm not so sure about the morality part, to be honest. But I think it refers back to
4896100	4906740	the question of how autonomous the enterprises are actually, how autonomous they can feel in terms of
4906820	4912180	the, I have to use the phrase, self-management of the enterprise. I mean, at the beginning of
4912180	4919860	our conversation, you refer to it as something that is not a given within your model. And I
4919860	4926900	would say we do come back to this right now, because it's part of the question of incentivation
4926900	4936660	that is not based on economic incentivation. How much do I legitimately feel involved in the way
4937060	4944740	the given enterprise is being run on the level of the enterprise? And then how much do I legitimately
4944740	4955780	feel being involved in the overall plan that gives me the like broad categories, broad directions of
4955780	4963140	what I am supposed to do. So I would say that given this constellation that you just described,
4963140	4971540	the question of, at least the perception of some form of autonomy within the workplace
4972420	4979460	comes back into the picture as a form of motivation. So this is something that I might add at this
4979460	4986100	point. And then I wanted to ask something, because I, when trying to picture your model,
4986100	4995940	never really got to the point of understanding it correctly because I will just say it as directly
4995940	5006180	as I can, but is there profit? Does a given enterprise have the possibility to, for example,
5006740	5014260	pay a higher remuneration depending on how good they have done their job? I'll be as stupidly
5015220	5021620	obvious and blunt about it as I can. Is there something, it doesn't have to be like money,
5021620	5028420	it can also be like more leisure time or anything as such. Because if there would be something like
5028420	5034500	that, some form of indirect economic incentive, then it would really, really, really alter the
5034500	5040980	whole picture, I would say. And it would also alter the picture in terms of if there is some
5041380	5047860	form of competition between the enterprises. So this would introduce a very different level
5047860	5053300	to the whole thing. So maybe you can help me kind of get a better picture of the whole thing.
5055060	5061620	Wow, we're covering everything in one session. This is amazing. We have to have a whole course.
5063540	5069700	It's good. I don't know whether I could, even this question, I'm trying, I didn't take notes,
5069700	5075780	I'm trying to remember everything. But yeah, okay. One aspect of your question is the,
5076820	5085940	you speak of profit. Now, let's assume for our discussion that we don't mean capitalist profit,
5085940	5090740	we don't mean surplus value extracted, you know, anything like that. But we're talking
5090740	5098580	about a socialist enterprise. The enterprise is owned by the workers of the country as a whole,
5098580	5105060	let's say. But it's also the workers who are actually at the enterprise and participate in
5105060	5112340	it have a major role, you know, and their interests have to be represented. One aspect of
5113940	5124100	your question is differentiation of income. Should people be rewarded for more product or for better
5124100	5129460	work? You know, should people be rewarded? So we can boil that down to saying,
5130180	5135780	start by asking the larger question, should the enterprise be rewarded? Should there be a stream
5135780	5141140	of income to the enterprise? We can even call it profit as long as we understand that the word
5141140	5146180	profit is one of those tricky words that means different things in different contexts. We know
5146180	5154500	that. So we'll just use it. Should the enterprise receive a profit based upon an evaluation of its
5154500	5160980	work? So first of all, the question is, how do you evaluate enterprise performance? How do you measure
5160980	5168100	it? How do you measure how well or how poorly an enterprise is doing? And the second question is,
5168740	5176020	once we have that thing, once we have that reward, I mean, sorry, let me start this sentence again,
5176420	5181940	once we have that measure of enterprise performance, so I can say of this particular
5181940	5187140	enterprise, and it can say of itself, well, we did this well, or not so well, or whatever,
5187140	5193300	you know, whatever level it is. Now based on that, and the reward we receive as a result,
5194100	5200340	how should that reward be differentiated and broken up into the rewards of individual members
5200340	5206340	of the enterprise? How should it be reflected in individual wages? And how should those,
5206980	5214740	what I'll use the standard term for them, material incentives be harmonized with or related to
5215460	5222180	moral incentives, the kinds of incentives that are given in the form of collective appreciation,
5222180	5231940	you know, trophies, banners, but not in a simplistic, cynical sense, but things that might
5232580	5238660	could at least be meaningful, they could at least have meaning for people. So come back to
5238660	5246020	the first question, how do we measure what an enterprise does? In the old days, earliest
5246020	5250900	experiments in socialist planning, of course, it was simple, the more the better. You know,
5250900	5257220	how did you measure the output of the work of a steel mill? How much steel it produced,
5257220	5263540	you know, millions of tons of steel, that was the measure, you know, and any other industry
5264580	5271220	the same way. Clearly, that's not sufficient. You have to measure not only what is being done,
5271220	5276340	but how efficiently it's being done, whether targets are being met for variety of output
5276340	5282900	and for quality of output, many different things. All of that boils down into a single measure,
5282900	5289940	a rate of return. Okay. Now, it's not a rate of return in a sense of a property income to
5289940	5296020	ownership of the means of production. The society as a whole indivisibly owns the means of production.
5297300	5302420	This is not a market socialist model. The enterprise does not own its own means of production.
5302420	5306980	But we're talking about a rate of return in a sense that enables us to evaluate how well
5306980	5313620	are the resources entrusted to us being used? And that's important, as I said before, you know,
5313620	5318740	that's something that socialists need to be concerned with. And you need to convince
5319540	5325540	the workers that we will, that we presume to lead in political struggles and eventually
5325540	5332180	revolutionary struggles, you know, that we will do that. You know, people understand that.
5332180	5336900	People say, we don't want clowns running the society who don't care about the resources that
5336900	5345460	represent generations of our effort and our collective labor, you know, to have created
5345460	5350820	these things. We want these things to be well managed. And that means being concerned with
5351220	5365220	rates of return. So what kind of rate of return? Well, not the capitalist one. Capitalist rate of
5365220	5372580	return is profits divided by capital. Right? Socialist rate of return, and this is an argument
5372580	5377220	I'm taking from a whole literature around what used to be called full income prices,
5377940	5380820	is not profit, but the entire net income.
5383540	5388340	In other words, wages plus profit divided by the value of means of production.
5389220	5396500	I won't use the word capital in this context. So that in standard macroeconomic notation,
5396500	5402420	it would be Y over K, not P over K. It's not profit divided by K as a symbol for the means
5402420	5409460	of production, for the value of that, the resources being deployed to create this result.
5409460	5415860	But the entire income, the wages, in other words, what in conventional capitalist accounting are
5415860	5424900	wages and profits, all of that is returns to us as a whole, whether individually or collectively,
5425780	5431060	doesn't matter. So that's one thing about what rate of return do we use. And that rate of return,
5431060	5437380	if you analyze it, think about it, has all sorts of efficiencies taken care of within it. It's like
5437380	5444740	an aggregation of attending to levels of productivity, saving of raw materials,
5446180	5450260	efficient technical changes, which use the capital stocks in the most efficient way,
5450260	5456340	never mind what the details of that. But all of those kinds of decisions,
5456980	5461140	if taken properly, would result in a higher rate of return.
5461940	5466900	So that's one. Let me just very quickly, then I'll get back, continue with another question.
5467940	5474260	The other half of it is that in a socialist context, the measure of enterprise performance
5475460	5481940	can very well have a whole additional component to it, something totally different. And this would
5481940	5490580	be a component that's based upon ratings of the enterprise by stakeholders. And here I'm adopting
5490580	5497060	some of the thinking of Pat Devine, whom you've interviewed, you've had him present his ideas
5498100	5503380	directly. But I think that's a contribution to this. Stakeholders, which can be the workers
5504580	5510820	in the enterprise, but they can also be the surrounding community of the enterprise. They
5510820	5524260	can be people who are interested in and qualified to examine the enterprise's work in relation to
5524260	5529860	ecology goals, sustainability and so forth, and emissions and so forth.
5530980	5536420	Industry representatives, people who vote essentially on how well the enterprise
5536420	5541780	relates to other enterprises in the industry. Soviet Union, for example, they used to have
5541780	5548020	programs where an advanced enterprise would take a lagging enterprise under its wing
5550020	5556500	and form mentorship relationships, where they would work on the technical skills of the workers
5556500	5562500	in the lagging enterprise and try to eliminate deficiencies. And finally, very importantly,
5562500	5567700	I would say, this is a socialist society and we're interested in building a solidary and
5567700	5575140	working class. We're interested in overcoming all existing vestiges of racism, misogyny,
5576020	5584820	exclusive nationalism, nationalisms, all of these perverse ideologies that keep us from
5584820	5589140	unifying fully and developing our potential. How well is the enterprise addressing that?
5589780	5594580	How well is the enterprise addressing gender relations within the plant and helping to
5595620	5602420	address problems there and advance equality in that sense?
5604020	5612340	And all of those things, those various evaluations would be supplied to a component of the formula.
5612340	5616980	In other words, it would just be good things to do, but this would be how you actually
5619140	5622580	put it right into the formula, which determines the measure of enterprise
5623460	5627300	performance, which in turn determines the reward that the enterprise receives.
5629540	5635700	Okay, so there would be the possibility of a reward in terms of
5638740	5648180	money, so to speak, depending on basic performance and social indicators, I think you call that.
5648180	5652420	Not money as such, but money as representing real income, real purchasing power,
5653620	5659220	a material incentive. Yeah, but there is money in your model, isn't it?
5660420	5668580	Well, yes, in the sense that it's implicit, it's being assumed. I don't build equations involving
5669220	5677140	a quantity of money. I don't worry about the velocity of circulation or issues in monetary
5677140	5687300	theory, but yes, I am assuming that for a reasonable period of time in an early stage
5688660	5698180	of development of mature socialism or MDIC socialism, some form of monetary unit would
5698180	5704660	be used as monetary units were used in the planned economies of Eastern Europe and the
5704660	5712500	Soviet Union, or we could speak of the currencies in place in capitalist countries since today.
5712500	5716420	Here, there's a lot of confusion on the left. I think a lot of people on the left go immediately
5716420	5723780	to a very utopian view. We should abolish money. I think what you want to abolish is what social
5723780	5729140	relations get carried in monetary form in a capitalist society, and not necessarily even
5729140	5735860	abolish those, but eliminate them as the possibility arises. It's one thing to say,
5735860	5742020	we're going to abolish something. It is stroke. It's another thing to say, we've reached a level
5742020	5747700	of development where this can now be attenuated or these aspects of money can wither away.
5748820	5753140	But Marx was very clear on this. He said, money is one of the last forms of coercion.
5754100	5760340	You know, and in order to eliminate it, development through a lower phase of communism
5760340	5770500	is necessary before that ultimate coercion of human beings by other human beings in the sense
5770500	5776180	of their circumstances surrounding them, like a monetary constraint on consumption, the connection
5776260	5784340	between labor and income. You know, you can say, let's just get rid of it right now. Let's just
5784340	5790260	throw it away. But if the foundations have not been laid for that, if the prerequisites have
5790260	5796580	not been established, the results could be disastrous. And we'll take you farther away
5796580	5802260	from the goal of reaching a society where those constraints on human activity, including labor,
5803060	5809700	would no longer be binding constraints, increasingly wither away, become attenuated.
5810660	5818820	We will get there, I guess, in more or less one of the last questions, which will be on transition.
5818820	5824420	But before that, I would very much be interested in your opinion on markets, because I think you
5825540	5831220	have a distinction or not, I think, but I know you have a distinction between a core sector
5831220	5837380	and something that you call, I think, the informal sector. And I never really got my head around
5837380	5843540	that. And it really reminded me of the, I think, the Chinese dual track system, the experiments
5843540	5850180	around that, because I had a very interesting guest on Isabella M. Weber, who wrote about how
5850180	5858900	China escaped shock therapy. And how they did it was through forms of cautious experimentation
5859380	5864420	with something they called the dual track system. And I felt very much reminded of these
5864420	5871380	experiments when I read about this distinction between a core sector and a sector that is
5872180	5881460	forming around that within your model, which will, at least it sounded to me, Bill, will be
5881620	5890980	some form of mild market socialism-like sector. But I think you would disagree with that. But I
5890980	5895380	would certainly be interested in your opinion. Maybe you could explain to us what the core
5895380	5899380	sector is, and what the informal sector is, and how both relate to markets.
5901140	5908100	Okay. Well, the core sector is the MDIC economy, you know, multi-level democratic
5909060	5918820	iterative coordination. And it's not a market economy, you know. Prices are planned. Now they
5918820	5924740	may be planned with lots of local input, but they are eventually centrally planned. The central
5924740	5936020	component within MDIC is constantly forming and perfecting a system of prices which takes
5938500	5945780	regular account of the natural environment, the future, the actual social nature of the
5945780	5955940	productive resources which shape rates of return. It's hard to explain without presuming some
5955940	5962580	economics, you know, in the audience. And here we have no presumptions. We have a whole
5962580	5969780	varied audience of people listening. But the connection between profit rates and prices,
5970740	5975540	you know, and the whole price structure depends intimately upon that. And the idea that
5976340	5982340	a general rate of return needs to form, which also I believe is true of an MDIC economy. But
5982340	5991060	I'm digressing. Let me try to stick onto your question. That's the MDIC economy. It is not a
5991060	5999940	market economy. So it's not a model of market socialism. And neither is it simply a state
5999940	6008740	central planned economy. This is important because in the non-socialist literature and
6008740	6015620	anti-socialist literature, socialism and state enterprise are equated. They practically mean
6015620	6020100	the same thing, you know, that when you talk about socialism, what you mean is the government will
6020100	6025060	make all the decisions and will decide everything. And we're not talking about government. To have an
6025700	6034900	MDIC economy, it would have to be within what you could call the state sector. It is governmental,
6034900	6042340	but governmental itself does not define it. There would be plenty of state enterprises
6042340	6046980	that are not part of the multi-level democratic iterative coordination system. It's a real
6046980	6059460	discipline. You have to be part of an everlasting, always existing, a continual, a system of
6059460	6064660	iterative coordination, a system of up-down and not just talking to each other all the time,
6064660	6073940	but regular stages of perfection of plans, which are to be implemented in the near future,
6073940	6079460	just while you are already implementing the existing ones. Implementation and planning are
6081220	6085860	interrelated and continual processes. People are at different stages of both
6089700	6099860	at all times. That's the multi-level planning system, and it has a distinct and necessary
6099860	6106180	central component to it, unlike models like Robin Hanel's and Mike Albert's paracon,
6106740	6113620	participatory economy, which says the central has got to be excluded because it's the source of
6115620	6120020	necessary, unavoidable evils, so we've got to have an entirely decentralized system.
6120820	6127380	There are many other variations on the model which could be described.
6129140	6133060	Now, the informal sector,
6137940	6143220	well, on the one hand, it doesn't really play a role in the model of the MDIC system. You can
6143220	6149540	form that model and you can think abstractly of a socialist economy which functions that way,
6149540	6155860	which functions as a multi-level democratic iterative coordination system. In the real world,
6157060	6165380	well, every example of a society that we know of, from the Asian countries, China, Vietnam,
6166740	6172660	to the Eastern European ones from earlier, they've gone in a different direction now,
6172660	6181220	now, temporarily, I hope, and the Soviet Union no longer exists. You have examples of societies,
6181220	6189460	even the society, and Cuba, even the socialist economies that have existed in real historical
6189460	6202100	situations, even the ones that have been the most pure, non-informal, have had huge informal sectors.
6203140	6208020	The Soviet Union had the collective farm sector. It had a kind of an informal services
6208020	6211460	sector because they always had difficulty integrating services into the planning
6212660	6220500	mechanism, so people used their skills to fill in the vacuums. The Soviet economy,
6221460	6230180	annoyingly, did not solve the problem of repair services for material goods that they were
6230180	6238580	producing. You could buy a TV by the late 1950s, 60s, but you couldn't get it repaired,
6238580	6244020	or most annoyingly, washing machine, so people with those skills, with the necessary skills,
6244020	6257620	set themselves up as informal suppliers of these services, and that was part of their informal
6257620	6265060	economy. There were others, as well, that one could go into, but of course, you're going to
6265060	6271540	have that. That's going to be part of the real-life process. The crucial thing is that
6272340	6276020	just because you're in the public sector doesn't mean you're in the core economy.
6278740	6284180	I regard the public sector also, if it's a traditional public sector, as may have existed
6284180	6292100	centuries earlier, or even millennia earlier, that doesn't make you socialist. It becomes socialist
6292100	6299940	when the democratic planning process becomes established. That happens by stages. It doesn't
6299940	6312740	happen all at once. This perfectly leads to the question of transition, because the whole
6313700	6322020	model, as I understood it, as I read it, with all these elements that I sometimes intuitively
6322020	6328100	would kind of tend to want to reject, but I absolutely understand that the whole model
6328100	6337700	is formed around an idea of process, and that we need to actually keep in mind the imperfections
6337780	6346100	and hybridity of actually existing conditions as we find them and as we are living within them.
6347220	6355620	I would be interested, maybe you can just sketch this idea of a model as process or a model as
6356500	6362580	transition, maybe, because this was really an interesting read for me when engaging with the
6362580	6369380	model, maybe the tendency within me might be too strong to kind of skip a stage or something like
6369380	6374980	that, and you would maybe argue if I would lay out my ideas in terms of, okay, there should not be
6374980	6381540	any form of wage labor relation or any connection between labor and pay and stuff like that, and you
6381540	6389860	would possibly answer me, well, Jan, this is not the world we're living in right now. You should
6389860	6397060	keep in mind that people are socialized within these forms of relations, and we should consider
6397060	6403220	that when developing our models, and I can absolutely see that you do consider this. So
6404340	6415060	maybe to make it into a question, how would we go about this idea of transition, like in the sense
6415060	6424020	of how could we transition to a multi-level democratic iterative coordination, and how do
6424020	6429940	you think about the transition within the model and the maturing within the model? Because this
6430740	6436660	seemed to be something that is very much on all of the groundings that you think about,
6436660	6442740	that there is a process of maturing and that we should keep this in mind. Maybe you could just
6442820	6448500	give your thoughts on that, because I think it's really important, actually.
6450260	6460500	Oh, well, okay. First of all, your speculative utopian projection of why do people have to
6460500	6466180	receive wages at all is very good. It's very smart. We should never forget that. I think what you're
6466180	6474980	doing with that is you're saying we can be in what Marx would have called the lower phase
6475700	6482020	of a communist society, and we could be dealing with the realities of that, and the fact that
6482820	6489300	the higher phase cannot be just jumped into immediately. We can't immediately go to what
6489300	6497780	we later on started to call full communism. Okay, let's assume that's true, but that doesn't
6497780	6503860	mean we can't think about it and keep thinking about it constantly in our minds.
6504820	6512100	If you were in a precursor stage of socialist development, let's suppose you had made
6512180	6521860	significant progress at removing the capitalist class from its residual power, from its ability.
6521860	6527940	It's lost the state in a political revolution, let's say, but we're in a kind of a very early
6527940	6536900	socialist environment where capitalist principles out in the real world are still simmering below
6536900	6546740	the surface and could reemerge. We have a mixed economy, or China. We have a strong state sector.
6546740	6555700	We have a socialist mandate at some level, at least socialist in the sense of an understood
6556420	6558500	politically supplied central
6562900	6570900	state enterprises providing some forms of stability and security for working people.
6571940	6579460	But we also have a spontaneous market system, and we don't stamp it out. Our goal isn't to
6579460	6584660	stamp that out any more than in the Soviet Union. They want to stamp out the television
6584660	6599060	repair guy who plays a very important role. He fills a need, but of course that can obviously
6601620	6606020	could have negative potentials for income distribution and stratification
6606020	6612980	farther down the road. We keep an eye on it. There we have our informal economy.
6614020	6621620	What we're trying to do is, through stages, gradually building up to the point where
6622900	6629300	rather than allowing a private market sector to coalesce into a small capitalist sector and then
6629300	6638340	a not so small capitalist sector, and recreate class divisions of the sort which could undermine
6638340	6645460	the material base for our political project overall. It could overturn us. We don't want that,
6647060	6653620	but we also understand that by trying to stamp them out at a stage before we have the kind of
6654420	6657860	flexible and systematic and sophisticated planning mechanism,
6660980	6669300	I'll use my term, MDIC kind, that could absorb them. What we want to do is we want to create
6669300	6677300	the conditions where those kinds of spontaneous entities with their negative potentials
6678020	6684900	increasingly can cease to exist because we have the opportunity to create alternatives to them.
6687220	6692500	That means creating a really good, well-functioning, flexible MDIC system.
6693460	6700100	One of the things that we can do politically is attempt to support that MDIC system
6700100	6708900	in the context of a precursor economy, not now thinking about the MDIC model as being
6711380	6716900	dominant, but thinking of it as just something we're attempting to start to build.
6717700	6722340	There are many tricky problems here, most of which I assume I have never even thought through,
6722340	6725700	or we haven't even begun to think about this stuff.
6726100	6736660	You can't set up an MDIC system on a tiny little scale. You can't create a tiny little pilot
6736660	6743860	project within a state sector. The state sector and its overall characteristics, it's got some
6744500	6755140	stabilizing characteristics to it and probably even some economic advantages. It has
6755940	6762020	economies of scale that you can draw upon for society as a whole, but it also creates
6762020	6767780	huge bureaucracies which have their own little centers of power that begin to develop, and it
6767780	6777140	creates bad politics internally within it. This is part of what we're dealing with, and I'd love
6777140	6784900	to be able to say, well, we could just develop a tiny little socialist planning sector, democratic
6784900	6791940	planning in this environment, and it would gradually grow. I came up with an idea a few
6791940	6796980	years ago, totally controversial, and many people hate it, but that's okay,
6800580	6807140	that you could actually have a bicameral legislature. Of course, the problem here
6807140	6812740	is how would you get to a bicameral legislature if you didn't have the political will to achieve
6812740	6817620	this? If you had the political will, you might not need it in the first place, so I'm not sure
6817620	6822580	whether this really makes sense, but it's the way my mind is heading. You would have a popular
6822580	6827700	assembly which would be elected by direct vote of the population. It would be a real,
6828660	6835300	a democratically, talking about the electoral form, and you'd also have another house
6835300	6847380	of the parliament, which would be a core economy council, and to elect representatives to the core
6847380	6853380	economy council, you have to work in a core economy enterprise. You have to be part of the core,
6855540	6862660	so if you are a core economy council enterprise member, you vote for the core economy council,
6862660	6869140	but you also vote as a citizen for the popular assembly. Other people who work in the private
6869140	6875300	sector or also the informal economy just vote for the popular assembly.
6878180	6884420	In a society where electoral traditions are very strong, if you're in Western Europe, the United
6884420	6890260	States, in these kinds of society, some kind of a bicameral legislature of that kind, existing
6891060	6897620	temporarily might be a useful way to go, because it provides an additional incentive
6898500	6905780	so that we're an enterprise, and let's say we're privately owned, or maybe we're a state enterprise,
6905780	6914260	but not part of the core economy, and we have meetings, and it can be pretty contentious
6914260	6921220	meetings, it can be difficult meetings, at which certain people say, look, we should be part of the
6921220	6925700	core economy, we should apply for membership in the core economy, we should become an enterprise
6925700	6932660	that's part of this iterative planning, democratic iterative planning mechanism.
6933060	6942180	Many advantages to it. Now, in addition to just the economic advantages of
6943780	6951140	the resources that you have available, and you might have expertise of the central planning
6952260	6959620	folks can come and work, be in residence with you, help you develop your computer systems,
6959620	6966980	connect you to the intranets and internets that run the whole thing on the basis of
6968420	6975460	internet doesn't run it, but it's a tool for running it, and participation in some of the
6975460	6980500	deliberations and the meetings of sub bodies within the planning system, you have a lot of
6980500	6985860	connections, but in addition, you can vote for the core economy council, you get to vote twice.
6986740	6989860	It's just an idea, it's just an idea, I don't know.
6994340	6999140	You could get into a low level equilibrium trap kind of a situation, you could get into a
6999140	7006340	situation where the resources to push you past that threshold where the core economy
7007300	7012100	begins to be able to become dominant simply by demonstrating its superiority,
7013060	7020820	by demonstrating its superiority as a mechanism for ensuring democracy, human development,
7022340	7030020	the whole thing. So the core economy isn't quite strong enough to do that, and you have a private
7030020	7035140	market sector with various divisions within it, you may have a cooperative sector, and you may
7035140	7040100	have a state sector, which is not part of the core economy, but which exerts a strong political
7040500	7044340	influence on the society, and people who operate within that, the mandarins,
7046420	7051060	they like their power, they like being where they are, they also recognize that their power
7051060	7057540	is constrained because of the existence of these other forces, it's kind of like a political
7057540	7062980	stalemate, and how do you move beyond that stalemate and get to the point where the core economy can
7062980	7069220	develop? But I'll finish by saying the core economy in principle should be able to pick up
7069860	7075700	those informal sectors, it should be able to absorb them. There's no reason, for example,
7075700	7082340	why there can't be consumer good repair collectives that form and that are superior
7082340	7089460	to individuals working by themselves and in ignorance of who their potential market is
7089460	7096900	and where people can't find them, and I can give you plenty examples of where spontaneous
7096900	7104900	market mechanisms produce non-optimal results, even in the narrowest terms of
7107220	7114900	the most efficient way to accomplish some task, so you can do much better by forming collectives
7114900	7120500	and operating as a non-core collective subject to rules, I mean there are going to be rules
7120580	7129300	regarding wages, regarding health and safety, all of that is going to be there, and eventually
7129860	7138660	applying for membership in the core economy, which you could obviously do, and there's no
7138660	7145780	reason why the MDI system couldn't incorporate everything that we now think of as agriculture,
7145780	7152420	services and so forth and so on. There's one more issue which I could talk about,
7152420	7156420	but I won't, I'll stop, and that's entrepreneurial labor. What do we do
7156420	7160580	about entrepreneurs and innovation? Maybe we'll do it another time.
7162340	7169940	Well, I mean we already covered a lot of ground, and before we finish up, I just wanted to
7170580	7177780	give you the possibility and also simply hear about it. I mean the science and society special
7177780	7183060	issues on envisioning socialism, they have been such an important driver of the debate.
7183700	7189380	Yes, I could see the new issue, nice, very nice. I mean the audience won't be able to see it, but
7190420	7196980	it's out right now in April, so go and get it. I mean they have been such a huge
7197140	7202660	driver and important driver of the debate, and I mean not everybody will know about the project,
7202660	7208420	so could you maybe explain what envisioning socialism is to our audience, and maybe also
7208420	7216500	give an idea of what it meant to try to push this debate all over these, I mean now 30 years,
7216500	7222900	and also specifically during a period which was termed the end of history, quote unquote.
7223620	7230580	I mean the first issue came out in 1992. This was peak end of history, so yeah.
7231940	7238500	Well, not too much I can say. People should go to the science and society website,
7239460	7246580	which is just scienceandsocietyand.com, and there's a link for Guilford Press,
7246580	7251540	which is our publisher, where you can order the issue or subscribe to the journal. I'd love to
7251540	7256900	have you do that. First, I need to clarify some things. The journal, Science and Society,
7257540	7264580	does not necessarily endorse, people have different views on it, you know, obviously everyone
7265140	7270980	at Science and Society thinks it's a worthwhile project, but there's a variety of different
7270980	7276180	positions and takes on it, and among the participants in a particular issue, this is the
7276180	7282580	fourth issue in the project that I'm personally looking at. I'm sorry I can't show it to
7283140	7294100	the listeners to this podcast, but authors range from a major Chinese contributor, Enfu Cheng,
7294980	7300340	Pat Devine, Robin Hanel, their names have been mentioned before as being people who have
7300340	7304900	participated in previous Science and Society special issues, but a number of other, I won't
7304900	7311140	name everybody who's here, the guest editors of this issue are Al Campbell and myself,
7312580	7318580	and I also ought to emphasize that I do not speak for that group of people as a collective,
7318580	7325540	there's a lot of different views, a lot of controversy on how to think about all of this,
7327220	7331860	but the one thing I think most people would agree upon is that we do have to think about it,
7331860	7337300	it's very, very crucial, and even those of us who are thinking about systematic socialism who go
7337300	7344980	beyond the level that people for whom socialism is just human goodwill and eliminating the gross
7344980	7351700	inequality and crises of contemporary societies, moving beyond that and moving to something that
7351700	7357540	fulfills our human potential more than we have in the past, and who haven't gotten beyond that,
7358180	7363460	who aren't ready to embrace any concept of systemic socialism of any kind,
7364660	7372740	I think we play a very essential role for being an attractive potential for
7375620	7380900	a much wider community that could play a very significant political role and a necessary
7381380	7390500	political role in the society of the present, so I urge everyone to be part of that conversation,
7390500	7396020	whether through our journal or through all other media, including podcasts and
7396740	7400020	Zoom conferences and everything else that we try to do.
7400980	7408260	Absolutely, so let's all get engaged with systemic socialism, or at least everybody who's interested,
7408260	7414020	it's desperately needed. There's a last question that I ask all of my guests and that is,
7414020	7417220	if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
7420740	7423700	I'd have to say I'm just joyful about the possibilities.
7425220	7428100	We're in a period of time when it's not always easy to be joyful.
7430980	7435220	I won't go into details, everybody knows what's happening in the world and why.
7438260	7444500	Our joy might be compressed a little bit by dwelling on that too much,
7445300	7450580	but we have the ability, we have the potential to get beyond that, and
7453140	7459220	even if you're not sure it's true or not, but you know that other people do think that it's true,
7459220	7465860	that systemic socialism in some sense, socialism as more than just a set of shared values,
7465860	7472580	which is important, but socialism in the sense of an actual alternative to the way things are done.
7474340	7478180	One of the things that Al and I, the co-editors of the special issue
7479220	7487540	of Science and Society, insisted on as part of this is that we simply have to get
7487540	7495780	further. I won't say beyond, I'll say further than. The level of thinking which says,
7495780	7500340	why don't we just all treat ourselves well? Why don't we just apply the golden rule?
7502740	7508980	If socialism is going to be a serious contender and is going to be the foundation for real
7508980	7515700	oppositional politics in today's world, socialists are going to have to be able to answer the question,
7515700	7521460	how would you do things differently? How would you actually make things work?
7522500	7527220	And I think an awful lot of people, be honest with yourself, maybe you're in that category,
7527220	7532100	will say we love the values that are, otherwise we wouldn't be listening to this podcast, you know,
7532100	7541780	we love, you guys are, you have a good vision of humanity in place, but do you really know how to
7541780	7547940	get things done? Can you really get things done the way the financial institutions and the
7547940	7553940	stock markets and the corporate bureaucracies, you know, that run this world for a capitalist
7554820	7562340	entity that is in charge of it? Can you accomplish that, what they do, let alone do it better than
7562340	7568340	they do it? And if you think honestly, you may say, well, I'm not sure I have an answer to that.
7568980	7572020	Well, that's what we're looking for, we're looking for answers to those questions,
7572660	7577460	and we won't find them all at once, we won't find some grand magnificent answer,
7578500	7584980	which answers every aspect of every question, won't happen, it'll be by process, and people
7584980	7588980	will be entering into that with partial solutions, which we can't even imagine what they are right
7588980	7596340	now, we don't know, because that's the democratic part of the total picture, you know, we need those
7596340	7604500	inputs, even though we don't yet know what they are, because they will help us to form continuing,
7604500	7611460	not complete answers, but continuing answers to the questions of how we can get on with developing
7611460	7618340	everything that human beings are capable of being. And that's, that's, in simple terms,
7618340	7624820	what the project is all about. Awesome. David, thank you so much for taking the time and being
