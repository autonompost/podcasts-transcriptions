0	5560	Welcome to Future Histories, my name is Jan Groos and it is my great pleasure to welcome
5560	8440	Kohei Saito in today's episode.
8440	12000	Kohei is professor at the University of Tokyo.
12000	19180	He writes with spectacular success about degrowth communism and very recently a German translation
19180	25200	of his book has been released by DTV under the title Systemsturz, der Sieg der Natur
25200	26960	Ã¼ber den Kapitalismus.
27160	36200	I was very lucky to catch Saito at the Viennese Volksstimmenfest and he was very spontaneously
36200	39840	willing to record an episode of Future Histories the next day.
39840	46080	Before we start, I would like to welcome Daniel, Jakob and Christoph as patrons of Future Histories
46080	50880	and I would like to thank Lukas and Wilfried for their kind donations.
50880	56640	And now, please enjoy today's episode with Kohei Saito on degrowth communism.
62280	63280	Welcome Kohei.
63280	64280	Thank you for invitation.
64280	66320	Well, it's an absolute pleasure.
66320	73600	Kohei, you have coined the label degrowth communism and it seems to be a very effective and kind
73600	76080	of provocative tool.
76080	79880	Maybe for those who don't know about it, what is degrowth communism?
79880	86720	Okay, so what I try to do in my book is basically if you want to really be serious about climate
86720	89280	crisis, you have to be anti-capitalist.
89280	96680	Capitalism, I don't think, can solve climate crisis by simply investing in renewable energies
96680	103840	and electric vehicles because capitalism is a system of constant expansion, constant valorization,
103840	109760	which is always accompanied by the increase of energy and resource usage.
109760	119200	So the new technology try to decouple the economic growth from usage of energy and resources,
119200	125020	but it hasn't been sufficient and it won't be because this system of constant accumulation
125020	131620	will always demand excessive production and consumption in order to keep this system going.
131620	136680	So I advocate degrowth communism and this has two aims.
136680	143280	One is basically communism or any socialists need to learn from degrowth side.
143280	147920	It's tradition, especially I come from the Marxist background, it's characterized by
147920	151840	a kind of productivism, you know, more technologies will be good.
151840	157240	It will bring many things to working class and also it will prepare the foundation for
157240	159720	new society and so on and so on.
159760	167400	But I argue that this optimism is not valid anymore, especially in the face of ecological
167400	168400	crisis.
168400	175960	So I think communists or socialists side have to accept this idea of degrowing, which actually
175960	184680	means not about going back to, you know, pre-modern, go back to nature kind of things, rather it
184680	192400	first asks to abandon GDP as a measure of progress, but at the same time, it also demands
192400	195440	to reduce what is unnecessary.
195440	199040	There are many excessive things, as I said, so why don't we reduce them?
199040	203800	Because they are not really contributing to our well-being and they also destroy the planet
203800	205160	and so on.
205160	211120	And however, degrowth side should also learn from communist side, because some degrowth
211200	218440	people are not so explicit about overcoming or criticizing capitalism.
218440	225600	But I think degrowth capitalism cannot be possible because, as I said, capitalism is
225600	227800	simply about growth, right?
227800	233720	So if we really want to have degrowth, we need to challenge the market system, the price
233720	237600	mechanism and private property and that kind of things.
237600	243080	So in the sense that the degrowth also can learn a lot from the socialists side, so I
243080	248680	just try to combine both of them and degrowth communism, which actually has been quite successful
248680	249680	in Japan.
249680	254080	Right, not only in Japan, I have to say it has been quite successful as a discursive
254080	257000	carrier far beyond Japan, I have to say.
257000	262520	So maybe let's talk about your engagement with the theory of metabolism, which is very
262520	264920	foundational for your perspective, I think.
264920	270840	So what does the theory of metabolism entail and what are the different layers to it?
270840	275000	And maybe what role does it play for your thinking about post-capitalism?
275000	281320	So when I talk about degrowth communism, this is actually coming from Karl Marx.
281320	288400	So I even argue that Marx became a degrowth socialist, a degrowth communist in the end
288400	290360	of his life.
290840	296760	In order to reach this point, I think this theory of metabolism is quite important.
296760	303680	So this also this theory and concept of metabolism, Stoffbeck says, comes from Karl Marx.
303680	306420	His point is quite simple.
306420	312000	He characterizes actually labor, the one of the fundamental category of his critical political
312000	318880	economy as the conscious mediation of human metabolic interaction with nature.
318880	323640	So human produces many things with certain aims and then they improve new technologies
323640	324640	and so on.
324640	330960	But this process is a kind of a circular process because human takes out of energy resources
330960	335880	from nature and they produce something and then they consume them.
335880	340620	And then there will be a waste of energy and resources, they go back to nature.
340620	348340	So this is a kind of circular process that is basically everywhere, anywhere in the time
348340	349340	of history.
349340	354740	So as long as humans live, this process of metabolism will continue.
354740	356140	We cannot ignore this.
356140	362420	And this is a natural law of our existence, I mean, any living being.
362420	368300	But the humans can consciously mediate this metabolism with nature.
368300	373260	But the problem is under capitalism, this metabolism is disrupted.
373980	378300	Marx called this disruption, metabolic lift.
378300	385380	And this is basically because capitalism tried to expand all the time and they tried to accelerate
385380	391500	at the same time, which creates a tension with this natural metabolism, which exists
391500	396260	independently and prior to capitalist accumulation.
396260	403140	For example, capitalism always tried to extract more resources and they tried to extract more
403460	405980	soil nutrition for the sake of food production.
405980	410500	And these kind of the process becomes much bigger and bigger for the sake of economic
410500	411500	growth.
411500	412940	But at the same time, it becomes faster.
412940	419540	They try to make many, many circuits so that they can have bigger profit.
419540	425860	And this creates a tension because the process of nature is much actually slower and it cannot
425860	430660	always catch up with the speed of acceleration of capital.
430660	438860	So when this tension becomes so high, there will be various contradictions such as soil
438860	445740	exhaustion, excessive deforestation, not leading to the desertification, but also the fossil
445740	454220	fuel has been extracted in such a speed that it is now creating, disrupting the earth system.
454220	456720	So leading to the climate crisis and so on.
456720	462560	So Marx's theory of metabolism gives us a basic idea of how capitalist production is
462560	469000	basically incompatible with this trans-historical law of humans and nature metabolism.
469000	470520	Right.
470520	476960	And maybe to underscore this incompatibility, you can also explain the three shifts that
476960	482340	you introduced because you kind of lay out the argument that there are these three rifts
482340	488220	that capitalism brings about through its specific form of relating to this metabolism.
488220	494340	But then you also argue that there will be no way in which capitalism will be able to
494340	503500	fix this because it constantly instead shifts in order to kind of prevent a complete collapse
503500	505180	in the face of this metabolic rift.
505180	506180	Yeah.
506180	511820	So what's interesting about Marx's theory of metabolic rift is that he's not like apocalyptic.
511820	516540	He's not saying that one day because of the metabolic rift, capitalism will collapse or
516540	518100	something like that.
518100	526260	Rather he's using this concept as an analytical tool, which means that he questions then why
526260	531740	capitalism actually survives despite this contradiction of metabolic rift.
531740	537420	His answer is basically the capital can always shift this contradiction to somewhere else.
537420	540640	The one easy solution is a new technology.
540680	547400	So basically when the soil get exhausted and the capitalist agriculture, they will introduce
547400	550120	a chemical fertilizer, for example.
550120	555680	But this chemical fertilizer is often produced by using fossil fuels.
555680	561040	So which leads to another problem like climate change.
561040	569160	So the problem is capital can use those technological shift in order to solve the soil exhaustion,
569560	576480	but it can only shift it to somewhere else by creating a new problem like climate change.
576480	579240	And there are also other ways of shifting the rift.
579240	583720	The other one he argues is spatial shift.
583720	587560	So which means that we have, for example, a lot of plastics.
587560	591000	Now we try to recycle, but it's just simply too many.
591000	595920	So what happens is that under the name of recycling, these plastics will be shipped
596040	599480	to, like, for example, China or other Asian countries.
599480	607360	So the problem of plastics become invisible in the rich countries like Europe and Japan,
607360	615200	but simply because this waste has been carried out, carried away from somewhere to another place.
615200	619360	And this is a kind of the global north-south inequality.
619400	624800	And the problem is that by shifting spatially this metabolic lift,
624800	629000	the weaker, the marginalized, the periphery will suffer more.
629000	633160	So this has been very problematic already in the 19th century.
633160	640480	Marx is arguing about guano, the resources to gain the soil fertility.
640480	643960	But the problem is guano comes from Latin America.
644000	649640	So although the resources will be simply extracted from Latin America,
649640	655840	the resources will be carried from the global south to England.
655840	663200	So this kind of center periphery contradiction is already dealt by Marx using this spatial shift.
663200	668880	And the third way of shifting the metabolic lift is a temporal one.
668880	672720	And that's what we see today in terms of climate change.
672920	679800	We emit a lot of carbon dioxide today, but we will not immediately suffer from the consequences.
679800	683680	Who will suffer? The later generations, the children today.
683680	689760	So the problem is those who are responsible today will not suffer the consequences.
689760	694240	The younger ones who are less responsible will suffer the consequences,
694240	697880	what we do right now because of this temporal shift.
697880	705960	So the shifting in these three ways always creates some room for capital to accumulate more wealth now.
705960	714480	But the problem becomes deeper and deeper in the future, also in the periphery and for the weaker and for the poor.
714480	719320	So this creates the question, so how do we actually solve this?
719320	726080	We really need to have a more just conception of taking the responsibility.
726120	730760	And so which means that we need to regulate the activities of big corporations.
730760	736200	We also need to tax the riches and then challenge the extreme concentration of the wealth.
736200	743400	And we also bring the view of the future generations in order to discuss these kind of issues.
743400	751160	And I think when we really bring these kind of aspects together, capitalism will be fundamentally challenged.
751160	758560	I think there will be some kind of the post-capitalist imaginary that is required in order to address these issues.
758560	764080	And I also need to practically introduce in this way.
764080	773120	Before we dig deeper into this political imaginary and the possible ways in which this relation can be formatted in a very different way,
773120	778480	I would like to ask one or two things about this whole complex of metabolism.
778520	786200	For example, I was asking myself, you seem to rely on a certain form of essentialism when it comes to what you call
786200	791400	primary level of the universal metabolic processes between humans and nature.
791400	798960	And from this primary level, one could then derive elementary requirements and so to speak, natural limits.
798960	806120	And I was wondering if this kind of conception might lead to some form of scientism in which it is kind of neglected
806120	812840	that these limits are also part of a process of negotiation and permanent scientific contestation.
812840	821360	So how is this border expressed, this kind of quote unquote natural limit and taken into account specifically?
821360	829080	Because I think there's no way around the idea that what counts as nature is constantly shifting and evolving
829160	837360	and that it is not a stable category in this sense, but must also be kind of renegotiated, so to speak.
837360	840840	This is a topic that I don't really discuss in the STEM Institute.
840840	848440	Rather, I discuss this issue in my another book, The Marks in the Anthropocene, which is actually a very important topic
848440	854680	because the recent academic popular discourse is rather characterized by a kind of monism.
854680	860880	As you said, what we conceive as a nature is at least not socially constructed,
860880	867200	but at least socially mediated by languages and powers and so on and so on.
867200	876400	So we can not have a kind of the rigid distinction between what is natural and what is social and so on and so on.
876400	884560	So even actually the metabolic rift is recently accused of falling into a kind of the dualist thinking.
884560	895560	People like Jason Moore actually criticized the concept of metabolic rift as Cartesian dualism of society and nature with capital S and N.
895560	898480	But I actually do not think so.
898480	908600	I argue in my book that the Marks was ontologically monist, but analytically or methodologically dualist.
908640	917520	So his theory of metabolism and his theory of materialism is basically about how humans are part of nature.
917520	925880	And they are, you know, also a constant part of this flow and the exchanges of resources and energy.
925880	934880	So in a sense, the ontologically, there is no absolute separation between humans and nature because, you know, humans are part of nature, as I said.
934880	942920	So there's some kind of continuity of nature and society, obviously, because society is also embedded in nature.
942920	948960	But that doesn't mean that we can not distinguish social and the natural.
948960	959640	Rather, I think it's very important to distinguish the natural and social because there are certain which recently called emergent properties,
959680	968600	which means that there are properties that do not exist in nature, that only exist in society or under certain social relations.
968600	971280	For example, take the concept of value.
971280	974200	If humans do not exist, the value, of course, do not exist.
974200	981120	So value is some kind of a social property, social category that only exists under social relation.
981120	985880	And, you know, if you look at other forms of society, it's possible that they don't have the conception of value.
985920	990480	Only under capitalism, value becomes such a central concept.
990480	997240	And then this value becomes the organized principles of metabolic interaction between humans and nature.
997240	1008200	But value doesn't necessarily take care of all the dimensions or the complexity of this metabolism, because value is according to Marx.
1008200	1011120	It's just, you know, objectification of abstract labor.
1011160	1020800	So the mediation of metabolic interaction between humans and nature by value is from the beginning very one sided.
1020800	1030400	And this will create the kind of problems that I discussed as metabolic rift, because value is not concerned about sustainability.
1030400	1038720	Especially capitalism is only about increasing this object objectification of abstract labor, leading to this kind of contradiction.
1038720	1046800	And what's important is in also addressing this kind of metabolic rift, we also need to distinguish social and natural,
1046800	1051320	because what is social is something that we can also change.
1051320	1056360	We can change law. We can also change how we produce.
1056360	1060160	We can also change what we produce, because these are the social things.
1060160	1064280	But we cannot change, for example, the natural law.
1064280	1069080	For example, the ice melts at a zero degree Celsius.
1069080	1077120	And, you know, when with the carbon dioxide, the world temperature will rise.
1077120	1080440	And these are the natural process that we cannot change.
1080440	1084920	But we can change by using fossil fuels.
1084920	1090680	We stop that and then we will use something else that does not emit carbon dioxide.
1090680	1097280	So because this choice is actually social in the face of those natural laws that we cannot change.
1097280	1104920	So even in this very simple example, we already distinguish what is social and what is natural.
1104920	1113360	Otherwise, when we accept everything is sort of mixed, we cannot really decide what we can also change and what we cannot change and so on.
1113360	1122880	So I argue that this analytical distinction of society and nature is very fundamental for any critical discussion
1122880	1130120	of how we overcome capitalism and how we challenge this issue of climate breakdown and so on.
1130120	1133200	Very, very interesting. We don't have to get into this.
1133200	1140200	But my intuition would be that there is some kind of third way that there is a politicized new materialism, so to speak,
1140200	1149560	you know, where this idea of breaking down this dualism of nature and culture does not end up in some kind of relativism,
1149560	1157920	but indeed actually proposes a different kind of politicization, which would be quite close to what you're trying to argue for as well, I think.
1157920	1163920	So maybe just another thing on the metabolism and monism, because this I really didn't understand,
1163920	1170080	basically, because you kind of criticized a relational approach towards this question of metabolism.
1170080	1173760	And you do not only point towards the work of Jason Moore in this regard,
1173760	1180800	but you also point to works of, let's say, Bruno Latour and maybe one could add Donna Haraway or people like that.
1180800	1190200	And then you kind of try to couple them to a form of Promethean thinking that is actually found in left accelerationism.
1190200	1194280	But I would argue that these are very, very different types of paradigms.
1194280	1200920	So I mean, Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway, they would never kind of argue for geoengineering, for example.
1200920	1210160	So this is not really, at least in my interpretation, coming from the same paradigm as a source, I would say.
1210160	1216960	So this would also then lead to the question whether or not there is something to gain from a relational perspective
1216960	1222800	that does not actually go into some kind of left accelerationism, because this is something different.
1222800	1231240	So when Bruno Latour is criticized for falling into that kind of Promethean tendency,
1231240	1236200	is especially because of his association with the Breakthrough Institute,
1236200	1242760	which is advocating for a very eco-modernist kind of ideas like nuclear fusion and geoengineering and so on.
1242760	1251560	And Latour, of course, doesn't really endorse that kind of decision, the political choices in his work.
1251560	1261920	But his famous Love Your Monster is about creating more intimacy of us humans and that kind of technologies,
1261920	1269000	instead of simply saying, oh, the technology that we invented is so dangerous, so why don't we just abandon them?
1269000	1274560	And that kind of thing is often characteristic to environmentalists or degrowth people.
1274600	1285680	And Latour kind of criticizes that kind of ideas and rather argues for embracing the more intimacy of humans and technology and so on.
1285680	1294080	But, you know, it's just one short piece of article, and then that doesn't necessarily represent everything about his theory, of course.
1294080	1300160	So I'm not saying that he's a left-wing accelerationist and that they are very different kinds of people.
1300160	1303800	And then Haraway obviously doesn't belong to that kind of a tendency.
1303800	1315400	However, at the same time, there's some danger in monism in the sense that when we really relativize what is social and what is natural,
1315400	1318760	we can easily say that there is no more nature.
1318760	1321400	So why don't we intervene more?
1321400	1326480	Because the more we intervene, it doesn't matter because it is already social.
1326520	1337480	So this kind of the sliding of the argument from the critical attitude towards a more uncritical endorsement of the status quo
1337480	1346960	and even advocation for the further intervention of social technology into the sphere of nature,
1346960	1353960	it's something that I find very dangerous today, especially because of the geoengineering and that kind of possibilities.
1353960	1365000	But at the same time, there's more fundamental problem to it because I think with the kind of monism, we cannot defend the humanism anymore.
1365000	1369360	And I characterize Marxism or Marx as a humanist thinker.
1369360	1380120	So his idea of regulating metabolism and fixing this metabolic lift is about securing a kind of the sustainable condition for human development.
1380120	1386080	So it is about kind of a humanist idea of development and well-being and so on and so on.
1386080	1395400	But when we have a kind of monism, human loses the distinctive position in this kind of discourse and the vision of future.
1395400	1399360	So we can no longer say human values are important.
1399360	1404920	The human value needs to be centered on this kind of discussion for climate crisis and so on.
1404920	1408840	But I think we can never abandon anthropocentric view.
1408840	1417000	Even if we talk about other species, it's from our viewpoint and it's based on our knowledge of other species and so on.
1417000	1420240	So it is in some sense always anthropocentric.
1420240	1429800	And at the same time, when we talk about sustainability or environmental justice, these categories are also quite anthropocentric.
1429800	1435200	Not only what is sustainable is required for the sake of human prosperity.
1435200	1437320	Of course, it includes other species and so on.
1437320	1441000	But as I said, this is also conditioned by our view.
1441000	1450400	So I think it's really important to have some kind of the acceptance of inevitable anthropocentric.
1450400	1453400	I'm not saying that humans are like exception.
1453440	1463360	So I'm against human exceptionalism, but I think we have to accept a weaker form of anthropocentric in a sense.
1463360	1468560	And then from that, we argue for sustainability, justice and that kind of things.
1468560	1474560	But that already requires a certain kind of distinction of human and non-human.
1474560	1491920	So inevitably dualism and even, you know, what I find a little bit weird is the fact that even like a post humanist and like a monist people are basically using the human language when they're talking for the human people.
1491920	1493800	They are not talking to other species. Right.
1493800	1503320	I mean, so this theory itself, they try to deny one of the central position of humans in terms of ideas, discourses and so on.
1503320	1506360	But they are basically working within the humanist category.
1506360	1515000	So I think that for the sake of protecting the nature and protecting the human development and so on, we need a weaker dualism.
1515000	1517000	So that's my argument.
1517000	1532800	Very, very, very interesting, I have to say, because I mean, one position would be to say, well, that these forms of relationality actually aim towards different modes of relating to these spheres of reproduction
1532800	1540720	and cycles of reproduction that you also aim to kind of transform, not the cycles themselves, but the relation towards them.
1540720	1546720	And so I would kind of see a compatibility between these two end goals as well.
1546720	1562160	But I totally understand your point about kind of not being able to leave a certain perspective that will always have to entail a human perspective as well,
1562160	1575280	because there's a certain gap within the theory on the relational part when it comes to, for example, like concrete proposals for a post human demos or something like that,
1575280	1588080	which would then be able to bring about a form of democracy that includes the post human, the more than human, because I was asking a couple of people on this podcast how one might think about this in very practical terms.
1588320	1592320	And it's like really difficult to come up with an answer.
1592320	1602960	But still, I mean, it's I'm still I would say kind of undecided if this still if this really means that there is nothing to gain from this strand, so to speak,
1602960	1610400	because I think specifically when it comes to this question of how we will and this is something you argue for as well,
1610400	1625280	how we will definitely have to change ourselves and our positionality towards the more than human in order to come to a point where this interaction with the metabolism is qualitatively different.
1625280	1631840	So there's there needs to be a kind of there needs to be some movement on the human part as well.
1631920	1640640	So we cannot stick to a strictly humanist perspective because we will have to be show some flexibility there as well.
1640640	1644200	And this is something you really point towards very vehemently.
1644200	1648560	So I see some conversion of the different positions there, I have to say.
1648560	1652920	So maybe let's try to change this last point into a question.
1652920	1665920	So what would then be a possible route to approach qualitatively different ways of engaging in this question of of metabolism?
1665920	1670440	How can we think about this relation in a in a really qualitatively different way?
1670440	1672480	The simple answer is degrowth.
1672480	1678800	So that's why I advocate for degrowth communism, because Marx was always, of course, communist.
1678800	1689320	But he was not so explicit about how the future society look like when it actually fix or repair this metabolic lift.
1689320	1692880	And he was quite vague about on that point in Capital.
1692880	1700440	So I started looking at his notebooks, especially because he didn't publish much after the volume one of Capital.
1700440	1708360	And the later stage of his life, he intensively studied natural sciences and pre capitalist societies.
1708360	1714040	But he didn't publish his results of research at all.
1714040	1721680	And so when we try to learn something from the late Marx, we have to look at these notebooks.
1721680	1735000	And I'm actually editor of Marx Engelsgesamt Ausgabe, which actually publishes this kind of notebooks that have been ignored even by researchers for many, many years.
1735000	1739480	And then one thing that I presented in my previous book, Karl Marx,
1739480	1747600	eco socialism is basically that Marx became quite ecological in his research on natural sciences.
1747600	1753720	He was concerned about soil exhaustion, deforestation, extinction of species.
1753720	1759080	And these kind of issues was quite central for his research on natural sciences.
1759080	1765040	But at the same time, he also studied pre capitalist societies.
1765040	1774560	And he looked at societies like Russia, India, and Latin America, Africa, and also even like Asian societies like Rome,
1774560	1780440	teutonic communes and other forms of indigenous people and so on.
1780440	1792840	And then he realizes that by looking at these communes and societies, they are quite equal, you know, it's a primitive communism.
1792840	1800240	So everyone is basically living on without hierarchy and they are, you know, quite equal and so on.
1800240	1807040	But at the same time, their communes, their communities were quite sustainable, long lasting.
1807040	1815800	And he used to despise this kind of the persistency of pre capitalist communes,
1815800	1826040	especially in his writings in the 1850s, he wrote quite negatively about Indian societies because it doesn't change, it doesn't develop,
1826040	1831400	it doesn't grow. So British colonialism, please come help them destroy the other communities.
1831400	1838360	And so that the British capitalism will be introduced in India and it will finally bring a revolution in India as well.
1838360	1846520	And that's very productive. But he changed his ideas in the 70s and 80s, rather correcting his earlier view,
1846520	1855840	because these society have some kind of economic superiority because it is more sustainable than Western capitalist societies.
1855840	1860360	So he accepted, OK, this persistency is actually something positive.
1860360	1865560	They don't seem to develop much. But at the same time, it means that super sustainable in the sense.
1865560	1873160	So he realized that this relationship, their relationship with nature is something very different from the capitalist relations,
1873160	1877120	metabolic relation with nature. So here comes in again, the dualism.
1877120	1880840	So metabolism with humans and nature is transhistorical.
1880840	1885320	Even pre capitalist non-Western society also organizes this metabolism.
1885320	1889680	They have to, but in a very different way than capitalism does.
1889680	1898600	And this organization is the basis for social equality and sustainability.
1898600	1909080	In conclusion, Marx actually wrote to better the switch, saying that the Western capitalism now facing to a very serious crisis today
1909080	1914760	needs to return to a higher form of archaic type of these communes.
1914760	1920200	This is how the Western societies, Western capitalism, can solve its own contradiction,
1920200	1926080	which means after looking at these notebooks on natural sciences and pre capitalist societies,
1926080	1936560	which means basically that Western societies have to make the metabolic interaction more sustainable and more equal
1936560	1944080	by accepting certain kind of the persistency and so certain kind of the steady state economy.
1944080	1949120	So that is why I argue that capitalism creates some tension.
1949120	1954040	It's irreparable and metabolic lift cannot be repaired.
1954040	1959880	But the socialism can repair this metabolic lift because in the end,
1959880	1965720	Marx realizes these Western societies will be also turned into a kind of degrowth society.
1965720	1972240	I think this is only the consistent way of understanding his struggle with his own ideas
1972240	1975480	about metabolic lift and historical materialism.
1975480	1979480	Very interesting. But then still, I think the question remains,
1979480	1986040	is there a material foundation for this type of degrowth communism?
1986040	1991960	I mean, it's not only relevant when it comes to the question of how, for example, nowadays,
1991960	1998880	the global south might transition towards degrowth communism, but it's also in general a question, you know,
1998880	2009600	because also like hunter gatherer societies were only able to be egalitarian when people were able to kind of flee the collective as well.
2009600	2013400	And nobody was able to kind of monopolize the resources.
2013400	2016320	So there were always material conditions as well.
2016320	2020080	So what would then be the material conditions for degrowth communism?
2020080	2026000	I think it's more like a natural necessity coming from the planetary boundaries.
2026000	2034400	So that's where this social metabolism is conditioned by the law of nature, like planetary boundaries.
2034400	2043600	So we cannot actually have the social system that constantly try to expand and expand, expand, which is capitalism,
2043600	2052160	because capitalism now clashes with these planetary boundaries, creating various kinds of ecological crisis.
2052160	2055680	So what we are facing today is this task.
2055680	2066240	We need to consciously organize was consciously or socially regulate this metabolic interaction within planetary boundaries.
2066240	2070160	So this is we cannot. So, again, we cannot change planetary boundaries.
2070160	2075040	Planetary boundaries are there. And it is not neomarsathian or anything like that.
2075040	2077440	It's just pure scientific fact.
2077440	2084480	We can also develop some technologies to be more efficient and so on, but only within these planetary boundaries.
2084480	2093120	So I think when we accept this boundary and but, you know, there are also many social dimensions like what we produce,
2093120	2099920	how we produce within these boundaries and many social and related to power and hegemony and that kind of things.
2099920	2104480	But in any case, we can change this social dimensions only.
2104480	2109880	And then by remaining within the planetary boundaries,
2109880	2117320	I think we just have to have less consumption and less production of unnecessary things.
2117320	2123880	And it means that if we don't grow more in terms of economic terms, we don't produce more.
2123880	2126480	We have to share more things.
2126480	2129880	And this is why I think the idea of communism is very important for the growth,
2129880	2134640	because communism is about equal sharing and mutual aid and that kind of things.
2134640	2142920	And so I think the material condition is there in a rather in a way that we don't really want to.
2142920	2146440	But the planetary boundaries are there. And if you really respect them,
2146440	2154680	then we have to have that kind of the new very different ways of organizing metabolic interaction with nature.
2154680	2158480	And I think this is the degross is basically the only way.
2158520	2167040	And then it is not yet politically attractive because capitalism creates,
2167040	2177280	you know, our vision of abundance and good life and the luxury by producing and consuming more cars and flying more and,
2177280	2179680	you know, eating more beef or something like that.
2179680	2186520	But if we need to have that kind of the more sustainable transition,
2186560	2192880	I think we can start by, as I discussed yesterday in the folks to Memphis as well,
2192880	2201000	we can introduce some reform measures by banning private jets, maybe first.
2201000	2205480	And then also we ban other kinds of the other industries.
2205480	2208600	And then we also reduce other advertisements.
2208600	2215800	And these are the ways that we sort of socially also change our desires and what we want and our perception
2215800	2219840	of what is luxurious, what is fulfilling and so on.
2219840	2224760	These will gradually transform our ideas and attitude towards degross.
2224760	2232920	And it can have, after a certain point, a very radical movement.
2232920	2237280	They can find a very resonance in the various fields of social and environmental movements.
2237280	2244600	And I'm hoping that my book will lay the foundation for the kind of convergence of these two trends,
2244600	2251160	communist socialist trend and degross trend, because there has been quite antagonism among these schools.
2251160	2260840	And I'm hoping that this will be the first step to create a more meaningful dialogue and a common fight against the ecological crisis.
2260840	2265120	Yeah, fantastic. I think that's a very good project to pursue.
2265120	2273560	Still, I would have like a follow up question towards this complex of material preconditions, so to speak,
2273600	2279120	because specifically when it comes to this relation between the global north and the global south,
2279120	2292080	I mean, if degrowth people advocate for degrowth, usually they are very keen and rightfully so to also articulate that this means degrowth in the global north
2292080	2301040	and that they cannot and should not kind of dictate the global south to follow a certain path
2301040	2305720	that some Western intellectuals kind of pre-describe, so to speak.
2305720	2318280	And I mean, this gets also kind of more complicated since types of green capitalism engage in what Lula de Silva has recently called green neocolonialism.
2318280	2320720	You know, so there's this angle as well.
2320720	2331680	And so still, I'm wondering how this can be thought about if you think about degrowth communism for the global south.
2331680	2340560	How much growth, so to speak, or which kind of growth is a possible way to pursue?
2340560	2349720	Or which kind of different forms of transition would the global south have to engage in differently than the global north?
2349720	2351320	Because these are different pathways.
2351320	2358120	You know, it's the old question, basically, of how can we get to communism not through capitalism?
2358120	2365120	Exactly. This is what Marx was talking when he was discussing the issue of the Russian path to socialism.
2365120	2376080	And then many Marxists used to think that Russia must be also modernized and capitalized first so that they can build a socialist revolution later.
2376080	2389600	But then Marx's answer was actually different, that we can actually have a way that Russia can avoid a sort of Western industrialization under capitalism,
2389600	2396320	that they can build their own socialism based on the communes that they still had at the time.
2396320	2401320	So I think this question always still comes back today, what global south should do.
2401320	2409320	And I'm not, of course, saying that the global south should immediately make the transition to degrowth society and that they should just remain poor.
2409320	2418600	They need, obviously, in many areas, they need more education, they need more electricity, they need more clean water and so on and so on,
2418600	2426240	which means that they need a kind of the economic growth, obviously, because I'm not against satisfying people's need.
2426240	2434840	And for them, for that kind of growth is obviously something good and we should actually support them.
2434840	2445560	But after a certain point, growth doesn't necessarily improve our social well-being and it doesn't really bring happiness.
2445560	2449600	So the global north is especially excessive in that sense.
2449600	2459880	And I think even the green capitalism, if they try to keep growing in the future, there will be this kind of, yes, the green neocolonialism.
2459880	2469400	And then they will extract various resources from the global south and then that kind of unequal exchange will be strengthened.
2469400	2482520	So in order to avoid that, I think the only solution is, again, degrowth and the global north needs to sort of limit their own resource consumptions and so on.
2482520	2488280	And this is the only way we avoid the excessive extraction of resources from the global south.
2488280	2497640	And what's interesting is basically that I think one of the responsibility for the global north in making this kind of a transition to degrowth society is that
2497680	2501440	they need to redefine the concept of well-being.
2501440	2505720	They need to redefine the concept of abundance, as I said.
2505720	2516480	And then that will make these new ideas of abundance and the development and affluence more attractive even to the people in the global south.
2516480	2524520	I think this is one way. Of course, in this process, the people in the global north need to learn from people from the global south.
2524680	2527760	The concepts like Buen Vivir is obviously the most famous one.
2527760	2543720	But these concepts can be introduced among the societies in the global north to have a better idea of what we should actually produce and how we work and what we should spend in our free time and so on.
2543720	2552640	And but only by we actually, I think so in that sense, we have the very strong responsibility, especially when I write about this.
2552640	2562640	I have the Chinese society in my mind because when the Chinese society tried to be like American society, the things will be so bad.
2562640	2569720	But the Chinese people are actually trying to imitate the Western societies in many sense.
2569720	2577720	But this has been also creating some kind of antagonism and stress and suffering among Chinese people.
2577760	2586080	So I think with the Japanese people, Chinese people can together work on the new conception of, you know, good life and so on.
2586080	2603960	And these are the ways that we can actually learn from each other and then come up with a new idea or new forms of development that will be some kind of a common denominator for making just under sustainable transition to another kind of society.
2603960	2607440	And you use this term steady state economy.
2607440	2609720	I'm just I would have to read up on it.
2609720	2617520	I have to say somehow this is for me associated with neoclassical economics, this idea of steady state economy.
2617520	2626840	And also, I'm asking myself, I mean, I'm sure that's not the way that you intended to to to to be like.
2626840	2639240	But somehow it kind of has this association of freezing in a certain moment of, quote unquote, progress and then just staying there.
2639240	2647360	But of course, we as humans, we we we would want to stay in a dynamic form of change, so to speak.
2647360	2649600	So we will want to continue to invent.
2649600	2658400	We would want to continue to to find different modes for producing different modes for whatever, for relating to each other and stuff like that.
2658400	2669680	So there's this kind of, I don't know, maybe conservative notion to this idea of steady state and maybe just some comments about it, because I'm sure that's not what you.
2669720	2685640	So I actually prefer the term degrowth to steady state economy, because steady state economy is associated with Herman Daly and his idea is not very anti-capitalist.
2685640	2698000	I mean, not at all. I mean, he said we can sort of use the market system and a system of private property once we have some kind of reformation on capitalist mode of production.
2698040	2706640	And it looks like, according to Herman Daly, as if steady state capitalism or something like that could be possible.
2706640	2708880	But I'm really against that kind of idea.
2708880	2721040	So, I mean, just sometimes I use the term, yes, a steady state economy, but not for the sake of defending that Herman Daly type of future society.
2721040	2728280	But simply, you know, to have some kind of idea that we don't necessarily pursue the constant growth anymore.
2728280	2732320	And that is objectively said, it's kind of a steady state economy.
2732320	2734440	So I don't mean more than that.
2734440	2743280	Yeah. Yeah. So it's just in the term, in the sense of like not to grow the energy throughput overall.
2743320	2752120	All right. So what I really like about your project is that it very offensively aims at trying to build up a new political imaginary.
2752120	2753640	I really, really like that.
2753640	2765160	And what you also emphasize within this project of building a different political imaginary is that planning will have to play a huge role in that.
2765160	2777320	So you say that social planning of production will need to be an essential part of kind of formatting this relation towards the metabolic interaction.
2777320	2784040	And since Future Histories has like really a couple of interviews engaging with the question of democratic planning,
2784040	2790280	I would very much hear your thoughts about this question of democratic planning and how we can bring it about.
2790280	2799320	I think that some of the proponents of the growth don't want to talk about planning because the planning is a little bit scary.
2799320	2807160	Planning immediately lead us to think about socialism in the sense of the Soviet Union.
2807160	2818840	So it's very central, bureaucratic and even inefficient system of a very authoritarian state, regulating the entire social production and so on.
2818840	2823520	But, you know, the socialist planning actually needs to be a democratic one.
2823520	2830760	It doesn't have to be centralized. It doesn't have to be authoritarian in any sense.
2830760	2842720	We can have more participation of the people and the workers in terms of deciding what we actually want to produce and what is actually shouldn't be produced anymore because they are excessive and so on.
2842720	2848440	And, you know, think about this kind of transition for a more decarbonized society.
2848440	2855640	We have to, at some point, need to decide not producing a car with gasoline.
2855640	2867720	So that's also one form of planning. But we cannot leave this decision to companies because they will try to produce a car with gasoline as long as they can.
2867720	2874960	That would be too late. So I think society, with the help of the government or the state, need to intervene at some point.
2874960	2882360	But that doesn't necessarily require a huge bureaucratic and authoritarian leader and system.
2882360	2887240	And we will have more of this kind of planning everywhere.
2887240	2899880	And we still haven't have a very good detailed theory with democratic planning yet because planning has been something very external to the logic of capitalism,
2899880	2906760	especially neoliberalism is about market competition and price and, you know, profit and so on.
2906760	2924040	But this system of profit making is turning out quite inefficient because capitalism invests in what is profitable, not necessarily what is important and what is sustainable and so on.
2924080	2933480	So I think we really have to restructure the entire process of decision making because it is not just simply about profit making.
2933480	2940760	It needs to be about necessity, provisioning and equity and so on.
2940760	2946200	But these are the things that, as I said in the beginning, the gross people do not necessarily want to talk about.
2946200	2954600	They often tend to talk about reduction of working hours, basic income, a little bit of carbon taxes and so on.
2954600	2963560	These are obviously important, but at the same time, I think this new idea of socialist democratic planning will be added on the list.
2963560	2973560	And I think here the socialist tradition can actually contribute a lot because we have a debate in the 20s, for example, initiated by Otto Neulert.
2973800	2983040	These are the kind of things that we can actually maybe, you know, explore again in order to imagine a future society.
2983040	2996880	You state that envisioning another clear, bright future from a Marxian perspective without falling into pessimism and apocalypticism in the face of global ecological crisis is a really important part of your project.
2996880	3001680	So you now just stated some elements of it when it comes to democratic planning.
3001680	3008240	Are there other aspects of this political imaginary that you would like to sketch for us?
3008240	3011040	I think, I mean, I'm not a policymaker.
3011040	3016240	So, I mean, people can actually add whatever they like on this list of demand.
3016240	3028400	But what I wanted to do as a philosopher is basically this reworking of our narrow horizon of ideas.
3028400	3046720	Because even especially like countries like Japan, where the society is very conservative, but also in European and American societies, people do not talk about socialism or communism anymore after the collapse of Soviet Union.
3046720	3051320	People sort of give up achieving something beyond capitalism.
3051320	3056480	They only talk about green capitalism or stakeholder capitalism.
3056480	3061680	And it's like everything about capitalism, but with some better objective.
3061680	3067680	But I do not think this is really compatible because capitalism is about greed.
3067680	3072400	Capitalism is about monopoly. Capitalism is about destroying the planet.
3072400	3078960	So I think the green capitalism or these kind of things are not really possible.
3078960	3084840	And in a sense, these are very ideological because they hide the truth that the capitalism is not sustainable.
3084840	3094040	But we will often stick to that kind of ideas because we believe that capitalism is something inevitable and we can never overcome anymore and so on.
3094040	3103000	But I think I was also inspired by left acceleration, accelerationist in the sense they also demanded some kind of the utopian ideas.
3103000	3110560	And I think this tradition of the left needs to come back, especially because capitalism is now failing in many aspects.
3110560	3115480	So I think one of my projects, Degros Communism, is OK.
3115480	3123280	It's totally fine to talk about socialism or communism again, or it isn't even necessary.
3123280	3135000	Otherwise, our political solution, our social movement and our other concrete measures like policies will be confined always within capitalism.
3135000	3138960	And I'm not saying that the communism or socialism will be very easy achieved.
3139000	3141760	We have to start with something that we could do.
3141760	3149280	I mean, even abandoning or banning private jet is really hard if you think about this power relations today.
3149280	3154960	But even after that successful banning of private jet, it's capitalism.
3154960	3156760	The society will be totally capitalist.
3156760	3162760	But with some very different ideas of what's the final goal of being rich.
3162760	3167600	Today, it's having private jets, but they have to rethink because it's banned already.
3167600	3175200	So our conception of wealth and our conception of economic activity or the goal of economic activity will gradually change.
3175200	3182520	And this will create some rooms for more radical anti-capitalist activities.
3182520	3190040	And so this is, in a sense, as Joachim Hirsch once said, radical reformism, radical reformism.
3190040	3191920	And so this is reformism.
3191920	3200160	We gradually, you know, tax bad things and stop bad production and, you know, ban certain things.
3200160	3202280	It's gradual process within capitalism.
3202280	3208120	So it's reformist. But at the same time, it will have a very radical conquest after certain points.
3208120	3210040	So this is something that we should do.
3210040	3214920	We cannot aim after the kind of the Soviet revolution today anymore.
3214920	3220320	It will not be successful. It will not automatically change this entire system so easily.
3220320	3225920	So we should have this kind of the radical reformist politics.
3225920	3237000	And since you obviously ditched this idea that there is some deterministic historical materialism in which there will be necessarily some form of conflict,
3237000	3245000	which will escalate and then lead to communism, the question remains whether or not there will have to be a moment of revolution.
3245000	3252880	Because right now you kind of sketched ideas around this idea of revolutionary politics.
3252880	3265760	But do you think there will have to be some form of moment or moment of rupture in which some kind of revolutionary moment breaks through?
3265760	3269400	And if yes, how what could what could this look like?
3269400	3271360	Oh, yes, yes. I mean, there will be those moments.
3271760	3276800	Because this current status quo will not be continued.
3276800	3282240	We have this kind of political crisis of ecology, capitalism, democracy and so on.
3282240	3291680	So, I mean, so many things will be going down and then there will be more and more conflict and expression, dissatisfaction everywhere.
3291680	3293960	And this will accelerate in the coming year.
3294000	3305680	So in a sense that there will be a moment of uprisings, hopefully, and there will be more radical imaginaries coming out of those movements.
3305680	3309560	These are recent events about, you know, Extinction Rebellion, Black Lives Matter.
3309560	3319440	And I already I always endorse those kind of attempts and I highly respect those people who are actually acting and fighting against injustice and so on.
3319480	3326280	But this is something I think, you know, it's something not what we can already predict.
3326280	3332600	And it will be I will be inspired and I will learn from these new revolutionary moments.
3332600	3339800	But rather what I'm trying to do in my book is what we can do even without those kind of uprising.
3339800	3344640	Maybe we will have to we cannot wait until these events come.
3344640	3353360	So we have to first implement some of the measures that we can actually start now without those ruptures.
3353360	3355200	But I also understand your point.
3355200	3360760	I mean, even banning, as I said, the private jet is one of the easiest example.
3360760	3369600	But even that will probably require some kind of the disruption and uprising that could be regarded as something revolutionary.
3369600	3371160	So let's see how it will happen.
3371160	3386240	But I think the first point about my book is basically we will have to set a kind of a new vision, a new idea, which should be today termed as degrossed communism.
3386240	3389280	There's a last question I ask all of my guests.
3389280	3393320	And it is if you think about the future, what makes you joyful?
3393320	3399080	Well, I'm not that optimistic about the current situation.
3399080	3409640	So in these kind of gloomy times, I often I sometimes think we are all kind of doomed.
3409640	3418880	But at the same time, we especially as a philosopher, I think we need to have a kind of the optimism of the will.
3418880	3424160	We will still have some chance to create a better future.
3424200	3430160	And then there are people who have been fighting for various justice in the past.
3430160	3440200	And that's why we especially at least in the countries like Japan and Austria, people enjoy basic human rights and democracy and a good environment and so on.
3440200	3443600	These are the results of a constant fighting.
3443600	3448520	And we also owe to the people in the past.
3448520	3462120	And I think one of the ways that we try to continue and we will we are we are witnessing the emergence of even younger generations acting in a very radical way is on the past generations.
3462120	3473920	So I'm very optimistic. In a sense, I'm very optimistic when I see these new movements coming out and I can also learn from them and fight with them and create maybe a better future.
3473920	3477240	Wonderful. Koi, thank you so much for being part of your gestures.
3477240	3477640	Thank you.
