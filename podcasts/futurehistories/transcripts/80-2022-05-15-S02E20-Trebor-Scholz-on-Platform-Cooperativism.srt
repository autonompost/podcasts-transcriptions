00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,840
highly involved in the platform cooperativism movement which will be at

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,800
the center of our conversation today. Before we start I would like to thank

thank you very much it's highly appreciated and now please enjoy today's

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,200
episode with Trevor Schultz on platform cooperativism.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,120
Welcome Trevor. Hello thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Trevor let's start

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,000
with the definition. What is a platform cooperative? Right so there I guess this

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,640
is sort of a three-part question right so I mean you know like people need to

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,160
understand what cooperatives are in the first place so here this is I'm mostly

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,760
focusing on two types of cooperatives there are many more mostly interested in

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,680
worker cooperatives where the company is owned by the workers that all have an

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,480
equal say in the operation so it's based on the principle of one worker one vote

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,040
and so it's democratic ownership right and then the second type of cooperative

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,360
that I think is most relevant to the digital economy and a good example of a

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,960
platform cooperative is multi-stakeholder cooperatives so this means that there you

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:55,600
don't have this wall around a small number of members who all like benefit from this

30
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,440
this cooperative form right by having higher wages or by having

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,840
secure place to work and by having a voice in the workplace which is like really quite rare

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,640
when you think about it globally and when you think about how this idea of participatory

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,920
democracy has propagated like across countries right so who claim this concept right as as

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,320
something that is very central to their aspiration but in the workplace where most people spend like

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:40,560
most of their day that is like quite absent right and most workplaces so quite fascinating

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,560
so that's cooperative so with a focus on multi-stakeholder cooperatives and worker

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,400
corps multi-stakeholder cooperatives including also people from the community that are so not

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,760
just a small number of the members but it can also have classes within the cooperative that are

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,320
that are you know like in the community that are other you know other than the workers

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:18,000
you know so and that breaks with this idea that cooperatives can only benefit a small number of

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,360
members and there are you know tens of thousands of examples of that in italy with social

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:34,160
cooperatives and i mean really all over the world yeah so and so that's a cooperative then

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
a platform cooperative is really like a digital platform now we also think about you know web

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:49,920
three like with protocols and other technologies but a company for whom the digital operation is

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,640
central number one so it's not you know a cooperative with a website or so right so

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,040
like really where the that's at the heart of their operation as a business and they followed the

47
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,160
cooperative principles that were you know designed by the international cooperative alliance

48
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:21,200
so essentially those yeah two two characteristics and could you give us an example of a platform

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:32,560
cooperative maybe yeah absolutely so there's a you know wonderful project and in europe it's called

50
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:41,600
uh it's called smart which is in nine european countries and it's focused on freelancers and

51
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:52,240
it's makes this very interesting move of building on this sort of legal a legal hack you might call

52
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:02,720
it to transform freelancers so to speak into employees so that means basically they give

53
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:11,760
freelancers employee status by making them employees of the cooperative and thereby affording

54
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,360
them all the benefit under labor law that are significant in some countries not so significant

55
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,600
in others so it really depends but including things like unemployment right and

56
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,320
you know it's i mean labor law is in most countries designed mostly for employees and

57
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,000
not for freelancers so freelancers do are not protected right and this move to make them

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,600
employees essentially grants them that right so that's smart they're doing that specific to

59
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,600
each country like so in italy and spain and germany mostly in belgium that's where most

60
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,600
members are and also in france and they have 35 000 members they you know wrote over 100 000

61
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:09,200
contracts and have like a revenue of 200 million euros a year so quite a significant operation

62
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,600
they have co-working spaces for freelancers and so they are let's say an opera singer and

63
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:26,800
you get engaged by like an opera house or so you basically the the co-op the platform co-op

64
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,360
acts as your employer and the opera house essentially interacts with the co-op not with

65
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,760
the freelancer so the the money then goes to to smart and smart pays the freelancer a salary

66
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:53,040
so this has the advantage that often freelancers suffer from not being paid on time and the

67
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,080
in smart's case they pay seven days after the work is performed no matter if that

68
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,240
organization has paid or not so and as smart is quite significantly large

69
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
nobody really dares to not pay because they would be added to a blacklist right which then no

70
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,840
freelancer would work with them so it's it takes the anxiety out of freelancing too

71
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,760
interesting model and when you were talking about the definition of platform cooperatives

72
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,800
you mentioned multi-stakeholder cooperatives and you said that there are different you said classes

73
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,200
within the multi-stakeholder cooperative what is the kind of representation that these classes are

74
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,280
involved with because i mean this might be a form of ownership a part of ownership or it might be

75
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,400
something different like really taking part within the the the structures that form the

76
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,320
the given cooperative so are there different models of representation as well

77
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:12,720
yeah that's a good question so one platform co-op that is in the process of converting from a worker

78
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,480
from an italian worker co-op of tech workers to a multi-stakeholder platform co-op is fair bnb

79
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:29,920
which as the name suggests right offers short-term rental and 50 percent of the revenues

80
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,680
go to local communities so for projects that the community can decide on such as whatever you know

81
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,600
building a playground or you know whatever the community wants so that so that the

82
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,640
the money the revenue that is generated is not simply going to silicon valley right as it does

83
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:59,040
with the competitor but stays in that community so the way they are doing this is quite obvious

84
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,720
right so this is where the hosts of course would be a class right and and then potentially the

85
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,880
guests as well and then what you point to is a complicated question which is really not so easy

86
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,280
to answer because it really differs from from co-op to co-op so like how you know do they are

87
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:27,680
for example also non-voting classes right so that you have actually you know stakeholders that

88
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,480
you know they are let's say really involved with the company but they but they don't have voting

89
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,000
rights right that also exists so it's it's it's complicated as i can't really generalize on that

90
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,800
but it's it gives you the way to you know but everybody is still part of it right so in

91
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:57,040
like a wonderful example of this is also in the italian mountain ranges like in so many countries

92
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:07,360
in the rural areas right so there are many small towns that have a significant retention problem

93
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,560
right so people are leaving and were so it makes it very hard for the people that

94
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:20,560
stay that are left behind to still operate let's say the restaurant the cinema the hotel etc

95
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,320
and so they form cooperatives right they form one cooperative like a community cooperative

96
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,200
that does everything so the same person might work as part of this cooperative

97
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,520
in a restaurant in the afternoon or in the evening you know might be a shepherd in the morning

98
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,080
and maybe work in the post office at lunch or so you know so essentially and this is important

99
00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:01,840
right cooperatives always emerged in moments of crisis right so they they emerge when like the

100
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:12,640
government or markets fail or even in the global south like support networks or families fail

101
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,840
then you have you know people turn to each other and and and found cooperatives in the

102
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,560
united states in the 1930s a significant part of rural america was not electrified

103
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,600
because the big utility companies didn't find it lucrative enough to electrify this last village

104
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,640
in montana right this just didn't pay right and so you know with the help of president roosevelt

105
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:50,640
at the time who wrote legislation making that easier people in those rural areas got together

106
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,800
and founded rural electric cooperatives and this is how over 40 of the electric grid in the united

107
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,800
states today is cooperative so essentially like there was a there was a problem and

108
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,040
the market right did wasn't interested to solve this problem and so people had to take it on

109
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,880
themselves and this is very important to understand because that is a very different framing than

110
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,160
creating a tech startup to dominate the world and you know extract from communities worldwide

111
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:34,880
and out-compete the competition and be like that let's say like one startup that dominates the

112
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,320
sector it's a totally different way of thinking right so it's that's not why they ever emerged

113
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:50,720
and one thing is to have one cooperative but what you are working on goes beyond that because

114
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,480
what you're involved in and what you kind of co-founded i guess is a form of movement so

115
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:06,400
platform cooperativism is a form of movement and i would be interested in what is the state of

116
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,040
things when it comes to platform cooperativism as a movement and specifically

117
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,040
going into the question of how do you succeed in networking the different cooperatives with each

118
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,760
other and therefore kind of creating some form of i don't know a better word but synergy effect or

119
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,360
something that goes beyond what one cooperative might be able to do and create something that

120
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,120
points towards maybe even an alternative form of political economy as such

121
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:48,640
yeah wonderful questions yeah so it's i think the big vision for this work is really

122
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,120
pluralist cooperative commonwealth and so i think what you point out is essential

123
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:06,080
because it's so we are working with over 500 businesses and there are many more that we are

124
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:14,080
aware of in two countries and so there are tens of thousands of people involved it's

125
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:22,880
truly global there are definitely challenges and which have to do with startup funding

126
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:31,040
right so like because the venture capitalist model banks on you know investing it's in

127
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,760
like for a venture capitalist to invest in 10 projects and seven of them failing two of them

128
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,160
succeeding moderately and one having this like windfall of money so profit which which will

129
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,480
just never be the case with cooperatives because that's just not that's just against the principles

130
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:00,480
and so just with like these other projects that i described earlier it's a community right that

131
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,920
sees that that having this business creating this business solves the problem that nobody else is

132
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:16,480
willing to solve for them right so like these social cooperatives in italy that i mentioned

133
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,520
earlier when i talked about multi-stakeholder cooperatives i think there are 11 000 of them

134
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:32,400
much of that emerged in after 2008 when italy significantly reduced its budget for social care

135
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,000
so there are lots of cooperatives that emerge to help people with disabilities to have jobs elder

136
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
care etc so yeah so but to to come so so basically people see that there's a need

137
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,160
and they put their money together so it's crowd equity right so now there are also experiments

138
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,720
like in new york city where a lift competitor a taxi platform called drivers cooperative

139
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:15,440
has over 4 000 drivers and and they have taken a significant amount of investor funding

140
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,200
traditional investors who want to see profit but they did not give them controlling interest right

141
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,360
so they they can contribute but they will not control the business right and that's

142
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,320
that's what really matters with cooperatives right i mean you can take

143
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,600
uh this money maybe even from a municipality so i think there are there are thoughts in that

144
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,680
direction as well like why couldn't um i don't know the city of hamburg or

145
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,920
others be a class in one of those cooperatives now this is quite controversial for like you know

146
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,200
people with a sort of co-op dogma they would not agree to them but i think it's interesting as long

147
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,840
as there is no as long as there is no controlling interest i think it would be wonderful

148
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,200
when municipalities get involved right so we are working with municipalities because you ask of

149
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,000
the state of things um we're particularly interested in municipalities where this is

150
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,720
really supported right so obviously the regulatory framework is really important for for this to

151
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,320
thrive and uh it just happens that this is particularly the case and emilia romagna in

152
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:37,120
italy so the area around bologna which you know some people frame as co-op valley right so sort

153
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:46,320
of antidote to silicon valley and with platform corps like concerning a teacher but also fear bmb

154
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,680
and others but then also carola in the south of india which is a very progressive state which

155
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,960
has added platform corps to their government directive which means that we will help them

156
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,640
my organization will help them my institute will help them to to implement and some 4000

157
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,320
platform corps in the next five years that's their goal and then there's california and

158
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,920
also now there's work in bonas arias so like on argentina more broadly and then there's a lot

159
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,400
going on in brazil as well like so rio de janeiro sapaulo uh state the states of rio de janeiro

160
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:34,000
and sapaulo so um these are sort of the highlights right but it's you know also the netherlands and

161
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:44,240
and uh finland are of course also very open to this work states countries like kenya have uh

162
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,960
i think 48 percent of gdp in kenya is cooperative so it's significantly a cooperative culture

163
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,000
there is an organization like a sister organization of the platform corp consortium now also in

164
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:08,560
in berlin in germany and the platform corps uh germany uh it's called and um there's now also

165
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,880
you know there's a platform corps uh platform corp consortium in hong kong

166
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:23,680
there's uh just uh one starting now in indonesia in java and so it's sort of in many

167
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,480
many different places and i think right now i think people are really interested and i taught

168
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:37,360
a course on this just a few weeks ago uh on this overlap with web3 technologies

169
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:48,240
so how can dao's wide distributed autonomous organizations inform platform corps in terms

170
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,560
of their governance perhaps and i think many people in that space many technologists in that

171
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:02,320
space mistake what they are doing for cooperatives often not so clear on what a cooperative actually

172
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,680
is so but that sort of helps a little bit because people get more interested and open and also

173
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,880
thinking about how one could organize data cooperatively so how could you have cooperative

174
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:29,440
data trusts so this is essentially like a group of people creating a small pool of data and then

175
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,680
giving like fiduciary rights over those data through a bomb to the cooperative or some other

176
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,640
entity so these are all like experiments right like this is just starting but that's sort of the

177
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,560
state of things we we had some small successes let's say with policymakers so

178
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,520
andrea nales made when she was the leader of the social democrats

179
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,800
you know added platform corps to the you know part of the vision of the spd

180
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:20,240
uh but you know her candidacy wasn't her leadership wasn't exactly thriving wasn't

181
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,120
but it's uh but nevertheless you know she did that and so we tried to pick up on that the labor

182
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:34,240
party uh under corbin and also under the current leadership still has it as their vision for the

183
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:45,360
internet is one of their 10 guiding posts for that so so yeah so stuff going on in the policy level

184
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,800
we have an institute at the new school the institute for the cooperative digital economy

185
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,760
which has like a fellowship program so we are just about to announce our new cohort

186
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,760
which will essentially research exactly what i just talked about so like all of these little

187
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:09,280
points i had this is what they're all time and i guess one very interesting topic for further

188
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,360
research would be the question of governance because this is something i'm really interested

189
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,480
in because i mean it's pretty easy to imagine like smaller scale structures of cooperatives

190
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,480
where people are involved in the really involved in the governance of the given cooperative but

191
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,160
the more things get scaled up and the bigger the the organization gets the more difficult

192
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,360
it becomes to imagine a like meaningful um meaningfully taking part within the governance

193
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,520
structure and the self-governance of the whole thing so are there experiments with like large

194
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,240
scale self-governed um platform cooperatives and what are the takeaways of of these large-scale

195
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,560
platform cooperatives because i imagine you you run into very different problems once things get

196
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:07,840
bigger well that that um it's not just a question of for governance but it's also a question of

197
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,480
scaling right and so how do we think of scaling and it's really it's really um important to

198
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,200
detach yourself from the i guess silicon valley's thinking because it's co-op scale very differently

199
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:30,880
so they scale worldwide um through federations and alliances and collaborations so in a way that

200
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:39,440
is drastically different to anything uh coming out of silicon valley so the the traditional platform

201
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:49,440
as you may say has uh is an umbrella right an umbrella of many small cooperatives so

202
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
let's take for example and i gave that example in my chat talk when you if you want to

203
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,440
hear this a bit more in detail about this cleaning cooperative in new york and it's essentially three

204
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:10,320
very small worker co-ops and they sit under this umbrella of this second level cooperative the

205
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:18,160
platform co-op that's its own entity and each of the three groups uh has a representative to the

206
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:25,360
board of the platform co-op so and then this is how they all decide then how this platform

207
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,320
corpus operated which really functions more as a labor supply for them right so it allows them

208
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:40,000
access to jobs better jobs uh better gigs than they would have gotten than when they would have

209
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,920
pinned a flyer to a tree right so they reach more affluent clients that can pay them more

210
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,440
and then this is something we have mentioned yet you know allows them to make twice as much as

211
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,320
they used to make before so this is often the case with worker platform co-ops in that way they

212
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,600
in care and in cleaning right they make twice as much okay so how do they scale like well

213
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:16,240
like this sort of federal federation is is one model of scaling and it allows them to still

214
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,120
retain this interpersonal trust and um and friendships uh that are so important to

215
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:32,000
cooperatives so they are much more resilient than other business forms uh which is the research

216
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,280
show set after 2008 like there were far fewer cooperatives that went bankrupt than other

217
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,920
businesses and you know it's not that they have any magic sauce or anything it's just that they

218
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,320
you know they they suck it up right so they stick together and they want this business to succeed

219
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,480
because and you could say this a bit more pompously uh because they have a purpose right

220
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,840
i mean it's not it's not about business it's not about profit right it's about purpose

221
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:10,240
and um and so uh and that's also what you see with other groups and in in india for example

222
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:19,440
we work with the seva federation and uh that seva is a federation of cooperatives and a union

223
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:28,240
so the union is uh has over a million members and the co-op federation has over 300 000 members

224
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,560
and well that's another topic altogether like how those two uh bodies act right like

225
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:44,880
i would you need a union and it turns out to be a very good idea but um the the point here is that

226
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:56,960
this is also over 105 cooperatives in this federation of several several men so and together

227
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,520
they for example with covid right like coordinated their help efforts to you know provide

228
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,920
workers with money and food and you know medical supplies like masks etc sanitizer hand sanitizer

229
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:21,200
so um that really makes sense and another huge cooperative federation in india is amul which is

230
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,960
i think the largest milk producer in the world and it's 1.7 million milk producers

231
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:36,400
small milk producers all networked in this federation and so so i mean i can talk a lot

232
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,560
about that there's lots of examples in italy as well that illustrate this well where essentially

233
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,640
like most italian businesses are very small but then they federate to be able to compete with

234
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:58,480
larger companies but with the web3 right you have like another thing coming and i'm not sure i would

235
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,760
call those cooperatives but they they are i think it's an interesting thing to explore and they

236
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,840
could work in that direction where through blockchain you can split ownership across

237
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,200
i don't know hundreds of thousands of people right so uh i don't know if you followed this

238
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,760
at all in the united states there was an attempt to buy the constitution so i think there are i

239
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,920
don't know how many copies probably a dozen or so which were printed uh you know initially

240
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:40,480
and uh they i think it was 40 million dollars for one copy and uh this online group that tried to

241
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,680
purchase it they raised 19 million which you know is not 40 million but they raised 19 million

242
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,000
dollars right i mean that is incredible and uh so then they set their next targets on buying a soccer

243
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,960
team uh jointly and then uh a vacation resort like a spa in florida uh that they wanted to jointly

244
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,520
buy so i think nobody really knows it's just i think it has something to do that you can

245
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,600
you can do that with blockchain right um what that would look like and i think it's completely

246
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,680
unresolved how how people would then vote that's it let's say they managed to buy this result that

247
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:28,720
now what right i mean so how do they run it um that would be a huge experiment but i think to

248
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,920
to split i think the huge the really interesting question is like it's the research is really

249
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,640
clear that like worker corps and to an extent multi-stakeholder corps are better businesses

250
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,480
for people right i mean that's so you know like it's you know more sustainable it's better for

251
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,680
the planet it's uh they are they're better jobs there's dignity in the workplace uh you know

252
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:03,520
people are treated as human beings but it's it's it's not um you know obviously as large

253
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:11,440
as corporations and so well this this would be an interesting way to scale as well right through

254
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,880
this type of like ownership fractals if you want you know uh but like i said there isn't really

255
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,400
an example yet of where that is actually happening but it's very promising interesting

256
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,440
yeah well i understand the interest the initial interest i'm highly skeptical i have to say because

257
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,000
i mean it's it it still very much stays within a very particular paradigm of private ownership and

258
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,920
then uh is able more or less to spread uh this over a given asset so to speak but well let's

259
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:58,480
let's say um it's always interesting to see experimentation i guess um so you mentioned

260
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,920
that platform cooperatives are the better businesses um because they are very much

261
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:15,200
oriented towards a humane setting within one works and gets paid and has social interactions

262
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,960
and so forth and so on so what i think is really great about platform cooperatives is that they

263
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,400
offer a very concrete alternative in the here and now and um that they also by doing that represent

264
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:36,880
some form of let's say building block for how transformations to post-capitalist futures might

265
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,760
actually look like so i really really love that but at the same time it's important to ask and

266
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,040
also to be aware of what exactly they they are able to do for what kind of things they might be

267
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:57,680
a solution and for what they might not be a solution so what are the what the what the

268
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,680
boundaries of of this concept are i heard an interview with you in in which you said that you

269
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,800
are often asked whether platform cooperativism is an alternative to uber google facebook etc

270
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,960
and in at least in this interview you you replied that this is the wrong question

271
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,280
and so i would like to to frame it a little differently and the question would then be if

272
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:28,720
you consider platform cooperatives as a solution for certain kinds of social problems um for

273
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:38,400
which problems might they be a solution and for which problems maybe not right i mean if you want

274
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:47,360
to run a platform or start a platform and you have an interest in a social justice lens

275
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,640
or if that is your mission if you're interested in social justice right then i think there isn't

276
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:02,880
a question that that's really the model to go with right but you know obviously like that is

277
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,640
really not the objective of most businesses so but if that is your objectives then i think

278
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,240
that would be the form to pick i agree with you i don't think it's the answer to everything at

279
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,240
all i mean it's not a panacea it's not a silver bullet or anything but it is very suitable to

280
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,640
uh like picking up on the historical narrative of what they have responded to in the past

281
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:42,320
so when you think about like one of the fastest growing uh largest areas of the economy that

282
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:50,560
is really failing that is care right elder care so uh you have we have in all countries all over

283
00:34:50,560 --> 00:35:01,040
the world and like a explosive growth of people over 80 80 and older and uh there's a significant

284
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,880
i mean millions of workers missing to fill those spots to care for them and uh that is also true

285
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,360
in germany and uh yeah it's also i think hundreds of thousands of workers missing in that industry

286
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:28,560
and the reason is that it's a low prestige and terribly paid job right and so with platform

287
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,520
cooperatives organizing this cooperatively and we see some examples of this actually

288
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:43,920
in in california in los angeles where platform co-op started by a union by the way has

289
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,680
um started to work with two hospitals and they have been doing this for a very long time they

290
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:57,680
had a pilot in 2016 or so like with 10 nurses and now they are working on scaling this up to

291
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,200
2000 and then the hope is within two years to 10 000 nurses and to essentially offer

292
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:15,680
uh care work flexibly through an app while paying the nurses

293
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
better than they would have been paid otherwise

294
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,680
so so i think it's a care and care sector is one example where i think this is very much

295
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,960
uh predestined to work very well and then also we see i mean you know it seems sort of

296
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,800
counter-intuitive but i mean this model in new york is working right with this competitor to

297
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,880
lift not so much to uber right so this is also interesting it's not so much in terms of scale

298
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,120
also i mean it's tertiary right so it's like the third biggest player in new york

299
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:03,760
um and has a chance at that you know um but otherwise definitely in uh for food course

300
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,800
so we see that in berlin and i think also Vienna but all over the world i mean there were i think

301
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,800
eight or so of those founded in Barcelona in the last year alone so um they uh you know they're

302
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
really emerging quickly not that they all stay around right this was specific to the pandemic

303
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,800
but uh but there is a large uh federation already it's called co-op cycle uh coming out of paris

304
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:39,200
which uh has more than 60 uh uh cooperatives under its wing of couriers and provides them

305
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,320
with digital infrastructure right so they offer them the software and in return they

306
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,440
uh all abide to certain principles for example they are not allowed to use motorcycles

307
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,440
it has to be bicycled for ecological reasons so um that's where i where you see this can really

308
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,240
work but we see it emerging in all kinds of sectors so it's very hard to say actually because

309
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,920
you know we see it with this my cool classroom which has language teachers organizing through

310
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,960
platform cooperatives which is essentially language teachers all over the world

311
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,360
and being members of that we see it for designers we see it for photographers with stuxy

312
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,080
we are seeing it

313
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,840
in many different sectors but i think a chaos care and

314
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:46,080
and transport transportation i think probably uh will be the most likely ones to succeed

315
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,200
yeah yeah and you know in some countries for example like in brazil um the one of the largest

316
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,960
domains of the cooperative movement in brazil is actually hospitals and doctors and nurses

317
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:06,560
and so i think this is really where that is together as well and what do we have to do if

318
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,520
we want to use this principle this this this type of social organization so to speak platform

319
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:22,720
cooperatives as something that that is the nucleus for going beyond itself because there is of course

320
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:32,320
an inherent danger in in the in the way that it might also by being the go-to place in crisis

321
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,280
kind of letting the state like from the hook which would be a problem as well because i mean

322
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,680
this is an obvious danger so i would say we need to like work in tandem with other movements with

323
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:55,680
other like ideas for alternative ways of doing economy doing social organization and all of that

324
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,560
in order to to make platform cooperativism something that like really

325
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,480
is a building block of a post-capitalist future maybe no i absolutely agree so i mean again like

326
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:19,520
another really great question um the uh yeah i mean i think it's essential to work with other

327
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,400
movements and political movements so i think you know unions are a great place to start

328
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,040
and just to just in passing to mention like why that matters i mean for many reasons

329
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,000
very interesting to look at that in the indian example but just to stay in new york where

330
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,680
you know like when they started when eric foreman and his colleagues started drivers

331
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,520
cooperative like one of the the main problems for a startup like that is that they don't have

332
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,080
marketing funds right so you can run because so much is dependent on supply right like you also

333
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,560
need drivers right that are available so if you aren't known right if people don't haven't heard

334
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,080
about you that's a real problem so this is where the vc backed companies spend you know millions

335
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:20,000
of dollars so they didn't have that money so but by working with the union which has contacts to

336
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,600
hundreds of thousands of people right so they were able to reach out to lots of new yorkers that to

337
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,240
tell them about this and well it helped when the new york times picked up on it as well so

338
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:45,120
um uh that's uh i guess one one answer to that question and if you think about like models of

339
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:54,720
political economy that go beyond this notion of platform cooperativism what are the frameworks

340
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,680
that you that you think about because i mean they are i recently uh read a bit more about paracon

341
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,920
participatory econ economics i will do an interview with robert and now tomorrow by the

342
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,240
way and and they when they describe the processes of transformation they very much point towards

343
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,960
cooperatives as a necessary and very much uh important fruitful building block of this

344
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,000
like of course long-lasting phase of transformation of transition into

345
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,840
other types of political economy so we already established that cooperatives

346
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,840
essentially have to be an important element of that but how do you what do you think about if

347
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:44,720
you think beyond that like because at some point cooperatives will have like over lift themselves

348
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,320
no i completely agree with that comment as well but i wanted to say just let's go for a second

349
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,120
back to the your previous question because i think there's more to be said about this so james

350
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,480
mahoon has just published this book platform socialism where he picks up exactly at this point

351
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:12,640
i think a very interesting and fruitful book but i think very much from a european perspective

352
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:22,240
where the i mean what we saw basically in the united states and in poland and in hungary and

353
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:29,520
in so many other countries is that people just realize that the i mean there's the reason that

354
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:37,840
they lost trust in government right and that is in the united states when you imagine a worker

355
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:48,240
having entered the labor market in 1978 perhaps all these promises right in 50 years nothing has

356
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,640
changed for that worker right except that productivity increased significantly

357
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:02,400
and wages stagnated since 1978 right so like if adjusted for inflation so

358
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,480
i mean how can you blame anyone that they would be disengaged from fed from federal government

359
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,680
right so now now i would not i mean it's just it's just a fact do i like that of course not

360
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,280
right and do i think is that participatory democracy is a project that nobody should ever

361
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,920
give up on and and electoral politics of course of course not right but then there's also the

362
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:40,160
reality that those systems are just deeply broken right so you see this even with the current

363
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,080
presidency to an extent right and so this is i think where municipalities become much more important

364
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,640
right and because on that level you can it's limited what you can do which we saw in the case

365
00:44:52,640 --> 00:45:00,880
of barcelona but you can do something and and and can actually really support a model like that to

366
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:09,600
an extent and and make changes to an extent right so so i want to be really careful about this

367
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,320
because i think i agree with you completely and i don't want to say i fully want to support what

368
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,440
you said about you know like not letting the government off the hook but they also have to

369
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,440
acknowledge that not every country is germany right and like when i look at the united states

370
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:35,440
i mean it's a deeply flawed system right to be polite and very very dysfunctional and

371
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,120
and that's not theoretical so you can say like well but you know we should we should

372
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,640
hope for this to change you know but then look at the real lives of people this is real people

373
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,840
living real lives every day and they are getting all these promises you know from politicians

374
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,200
and they just don't come through it's not felt in their lives and i think this has to change right

375
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:09,280
and uh and they there's i think a significant feeling of a lack of voice right that you don't

376
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:17,120
have a voice in society which also cooperatives are in response to because when you think about

377
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,720
in the united states incarcerated people are returning from prison so you know returning

378
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:30,320
citizens entering the workplace so they are excluded from federal elections right i don't

379
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,440
know if you know this so like when you come out of prison in the u.s you cannot vote anymore

380
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:40,640
and uh so well those are the only workplaces where they you know actually have a real voice

381
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:50,480
like they are equal members and have a voice and i think that is um i mean i think ultimately it's

382
00:46:50,480 --> 00:47:00,400
about uh social democracy i think that's a social democracy where people really have a felt

383
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,560
relationship to what's happening in the government really changing their lives

384
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,840
and the government that also really represents the types of people that actually constitute the

385
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:20,000
population right so that kind of uh stakeholder society right like where people really feel

386
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:27,360
part of that uh well i had talked about the vision before you had asked before and i appointed to

387
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:37,920
a vision of a sort of pluralistic uh commonwealth right so where cooperatives are part of a global

388
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:49,120
network of businesses that can also change the sort of north south dynamic right this gap

389
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,640
because which of course is a criticism of cooperatives today which is like even the

390
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,600
largest cooperatives like mondragon are dependent on supply chains that are just as deeply

391
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:10,400
exploitative as um as anyone else and if there would also be cooperatives in the global south

392
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,720
that then produce for cooperatives in the global north right and you would establish this um this

393
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,280
commonwealth you could change that you could even extend that vision to what some people have called

394
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,760
like data colonialism right and to to push back against how which which i think affects people in

395
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,960
the global south much more than people in the global north uh because the data collection is

396
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,760
much more ruthless um to actually put people in the global south in charge of their own data

397
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,520
through data trusts or things we had mentioned earlier and maybe push back on that in this way

398
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:55,360
as well so i think that's a vision yeah i mean i'm i think paracorn is a great approach

399
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,720
as well there are many right of the sort of post-work society and many others

400
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:12,400
which i support but you know i think they are often so far away that and this is very important

401
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,680
you know i'm not at all taking away from that but i think what's there is a lot of that you

402
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:25,200
know there's a lot of these long-term visions uh what is there's very very few of uh these sort

403
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:32,880
of next steps right and i think uh like a lot of academics like really discourage this right they

404
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,800
say like wow this is just too pragmatic and you get stuck in this sort of presentism or whatever

405
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,440
you want to call it and i really disagree with that and i think it's it's uh deeply disrespectful

406
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:53,440
of the lives of people now of the workers now that are living in these super precarious situations

407
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,600
so i think to build something as you said a nucleus of like a scaffolding right a scaffolding on

408
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:06,640
which you can then erect uh like a post-capitalist vision or let's say like a social democracy just

409
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:16,720
on the way to that is is deeply valuable and and something i really support

410
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,840
and there's one question i ask all of my guests at the end and this is if you think about the

411
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:34,400
future what makes you joyful well i mean maybe i can talk to you about a class i taught which

412
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:47,840
sounds um may be expected but um in 2020 in february uh mondragon the largest workup

413
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,880
worker corp in the world right so they came to visit me at the university

414
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,440
and shortly thereafter the pandemic started and we immediately uh you know we signed a paper to

415
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:04,640
collaborate and um and we started a class an online class on platform co-ops like an emergency

416
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:14,960
response and we taught over 1200 students from 57 countries and uh and managed because there was

417
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:24,000
a sense of urgency to engage uh over 50 organizing over 60 organizations actually in those countries

418
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,560
so they supported the course locally helping people with their local knowledge about the laws

419
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:40,640
and language etc to start those those uh projects and we had weekly meetings uh everybody in their

420
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:48,240
lockdown and in a time which was really rather dark and possibly depressing uh and for me this

421
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:55,840
was just i mean it was an incredible experience because you saw all these people you know like

422
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:03,200
from i don't know transgender entrepreneurs in malaysia connecting with like african-american

423
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:12,640
entrepreneurs in selma alabama i mean like who i mean just to see these like in front of you like

424
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:20,480
all these people all over the world right having this wonderful spirit and all dedicating themselves

425
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:27,840
to changing their world uh i mean i guess if anything could give you hope i mean that was

426
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:39,120
definitely a moment um to and it really uh sowed the seeds for further work right because now these

427
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:47,760
organizations uh learned about platform co-ops and they are now incubating them right also after

428
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,160
a couple classes over and uh and we still hear from projects coming out of that

429
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,360
um and so on so it's a very it's a very beautiful experience

430
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:07,280
