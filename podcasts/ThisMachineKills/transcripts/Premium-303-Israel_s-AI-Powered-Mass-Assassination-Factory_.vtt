00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
When a child is killed in Gaza, it's because somebody made a decision that this killing

00:09.920 --> 00:15.320
was worth it to hit another target, and this is according to five sources that I've spoken

00:15.320 --> 00:17.160
with in Israeli intelligence.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.960
In all of the target fires that Israel is bombing right now, the amount of civilians

00:22.960 --> 00:27.520
that are likely to be killed is written down.

00:27.520 --> 00:32.160
After October 7th, there is a total disregard for Palestinian civilian life, even when hitting

00:32.160 --> 00:37.240
targets that are either not distinctly military in nature.

00:37.240 --> 00:43.360
And I think that to look at the civilian devastation that is happening right now in Gaza, you have

00:43.360 --> 00:47.640
to understand that it's a consequence of a particular Israeli war policy.

00:47.640 --> 00:55.840
It is a war policy that has a very loose interpretation of what a military target is, also attacking

00:55.840 --> 00:58.520
people in civilian spaces.

00:58.520 --> 01:04.440
It is a war policy that centers on deterrents and hitting these power targets that are intended

01:04.440 --> 01:13.320
to place civilian pressure on Hamas, and it is a war policy that is increasingly being

01:13.320 --> 01:18.840
helped by the use of big data, automation software, and AI.

01:18.840 --> 01:26.040
My evidence suggests that many, many of the of the civilians who are being killed in Gaza

01:26.040 --> 01:33.080
are being killed as a result of these policies that I do not think are justifiable policies.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.000
International law experts would call them war crimes.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.880
Hello comrades.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.200
It's episode 303 of This Machine Kills.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.320
I'm Jaythin, joined by Ed and producer Jeremy in the future.

01:56.320 --> 02:00.880
It's your premium episode for this week, but I'm just going to say right up off the top

02:00.880 --> 02:08.880
because we are going to get into a topic, into a very long investigative report that

02:08.880 --> 02:16.040
is fucking stunning and shocking to me, stunning in its content, but also as Ed and I were

02:16.200 --> 02:21.760
yelling about before recording, stunning in the fact that nobody else is fucking talking

02:21.760 --> 02:26.800
about it and everyone needs to be talking about it.

02:26.800 --> 02:31.880
While this is a premium episode, largely just because that's how the schedule of our recordings

02:31.880 --> 02:38.080
worked out, we are going to pretty quickly unlock this one for the free feed because

02:38.080 --> 02:45.560
this is something that deserves much wider discussion than it's receiving, especially

02:45.560 --> 02:53.720
among people who like us are constantly crowing about the real material and imminent consequences

02:53.720 --> 03:02.120
of AI and its use by people in power, whether that's corporations or governments, militaries,

03:02.120 --> 03:04.120
whatever it might be.

03:04.120 --> 03:11.760
And yet a lot of people ain't talking about this topic that we got for you all today.

03:11.760 --> 03:19.000
And so we need to, yeah, we need to do our part to at least try to bring some more attention

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
to it.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.680
So let's set the scene here, Ed.

03:23.680 --> 03:34.780
So about a week ago as a recording for us, 972 Magazine in partnership with Local Call,

03:34.780 --> 03:45.260
So 972 Magazine is a left-wing politics magazine, politics and news magazine based in Tel Aviv

03:45.260 --> 03:49.860
and Local Call is a Hebrew language publication.

03:49.860 --> 03:57.680
So 972 publishes a lot of investigative reporting from a left-wing perspective about Israel

03:57.680 --> 03:59.520
and Palestine.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.900
They're based in Tel Aviv, although they publish a lot of their stuff in English because they

04:03.020 --> 04:06.700
want a big international audience to read it.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.700
They want to draw attention to it.

04:08.700 --> 04:14.020
And they've published in partnership with Local Call, which is a Hebrew language based

04:14.020 --> 04:28.060
outlet in Israel, this just long and stunning report titled A Mass Assassination Factory

04:28.260 --> 04:32.440
Inside Israel's Calculated Bombing of Gaza.

04:32.440 --> 04:37.700
And then the deck here is permissive airstrikes on non-military targets and the use of an

04:37.700 --> 04:43.280
artificial intelligence system have enabled the Israeli army to carry out its deadliest

04:43.280 --> 04:45.660
war on Gaza.

04:45.660 --> 04:55.420
So this is a really long piece on the systems, the technological systems and the military

04:55.420 --> 05:05.220
strategies that are underlying Gaza's current and previous military campaigns, the genocide

05:05.220 --> 05:12.780
that they're waging, the mass destruction that they are committing on Gaza, this AI

05:12.780 --> 05:18.100
system that is really being revealed in this report that we're going to talk about and

05:18.700 --> 05:26.860
strategy underlying that this is what is a really kind of massive foundational pillar

05:26.860 --> 05:33.220
behind everything that we see happening in Gaza right now.

05:33.220 --> 05:37.900
And of course, when there's an AI angle, TMK is going to be on the case.

05:37.900 --> 05:47.180
But this is striking me as not just a little bit of AI sauce on something else.

05:47.180 --> 05:55.500
This is really striking me as a case where Israel and the IDF is really, you know, and

05:55.500 --> 06:08.980
proudly putting AI at the front and center of their strategies, their target making.

06:08.980 --> 06:14.860
They've got this, we'll get into it, but there's like a target administrative system or whatever

06:14.940 --> 06:25.180
it is that is really focused on creating in a really mass produced way targets for these

06:25.180 --> 06:32.700
like one ton bombs that Israel is dropping on high rise buildings, on universities, on

06:32.700 --> 06:40.420
hospitals, on mosque, on open air, you know, flea markets, on schools, wherever they can.

06:40.460 --> 06:47.940
They are claiming at least that this AI system that we'll get into is what's spitting out

06:47.940 --> 06:54.380
all of these targets, right, is giving them, as they claim, 100 targets a day, more targets

06:54.380 --> 07:00.820
than they can keep up with with their bombing campaign, giving out of a total database of

07:00.820 --> 07:08.380
something like 30 to 40,000 individual targets for Israel to airstrike.

07:08.420 --> 07:12.060
There's obviously a lot here, but we'll get into the details.

07:12.500 --> 07:16.580
There's a lot to discuss around the kind of the politics of this.

07:16.580 --> 07:23.220
There's a lot to discuss around the technology of this as well and what what we should or

07:23.220 --> 07:28.740
should not believe in terms of what IDF spokespeople or the IDF chief of staff is saying

07:28.740 --> 07:31.580
and claiming versus what might be the actual fact.

07:31.700 --> 07:40.180
But there is also a lot to be said about how, at the end of the day, there is a really clear,

07:40.660 --> 07:49.980
you know, AI, whether it's an AI powered or an AI alibi, right, justified by AI, there

07:49.980 --> 07:53.980
is a really clear kill chain happening here.

07:54.060 --> 07:57.380
There's a really clear kill matrix happening here.

07:57.540 --> 08:05.540
You know, as we get into this, I think astute listeners might recall some of the reporting

08:05.820 --> 08:12.900
from 10 years ago, you know, in 2013 around the Obama administration's secret kill

08:12.900 --> 08:19.100
matrix, right, or the disposition matrix, the kill list that they had created.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.220
So crazy. They call it the dispossession matrix.

08:22.220 --> 08:26.940
It's like it's some fucking spin off of the dispossessed from Ursula Le Guin, you know.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
Oh, my God.

08:28.940 --> 08:34.260
But, you know, this kill list that the Obama administration created to guide their drone

08:34.260 --> 08:41.460
strikes, right, that and so astute listeners might find some really obvious connections

08:41.460 --> 08:47.420
here from the from 10 years ago with the Obama administration's kill list or or I should

08:47.540 --> 08:52.620
say it's the disposition matrix, but it did dispossess a lot of people of their lives.

08:52.620 --> 08:55.300
That's for sure. And then upgrade.

08:55.300 --> 09:03.020
And then what we're talking about now with this AI system that Israel has is very much

09:03.020 --> 09:12.100
a in the direct lineage of the disposition matrix, but is one that, you know, is powered

09:12.100 --> 09:18.380
by machine learning, is taking it to another level, is handing over a lot more decision

09:18.380 --> 09:24.540
making to an automated system, whereas if the kill list, the disposition matrix was

09:24.540 --> 09:33.020
a database, this AI system that Israel has is very much at least in the way that the

09:33.020 --> 09:39.420
IDF is talking about it quite explicitly from both current and former soldiers who spoke

09:39.420 --> 09:42.100
to 972 and intelligence officials.

09:42.420 --> 09:49.980
They are talking about it as a automated system that that that that title mass assassination

09:49.980 --> 09:57.300
factory is not a bit of a stylistic verve that the magazine came up with.

09:57.460 --> 10:05.580
That is a direct quote from an IDF source who called it a mass assassination factory.

10:05.700 --> 10:11.620
Right. And so I think let's get into what this system is, what the underlying strategy,

10:11.620 --> 10:14.060
the military strategy is for this.

10:14.260 --> 10:16.700
But it's it's it's stunning.

10:16.700 --> 10:22.780
It's shocking. And it's even to people like me and Ed, who like our whole job is to not

10:22.780 --> 10:28.820
only know about this stuff, but to like think about it in the most cynical and pessimistic

10:28.820 --> 10:30.140
terms possible.

10:30.300 --> 10:39.940
And so it is always a real a real blow when we read stuff that is beyond even our our

10:39.940 --> 10:42.860
imagination of what's actually going on.

10:44.460 --> 10:47.660
You know, this article and we were talking a little bit about this before this article

10:47.660 --> 10:55.660
sickening on two accounts, right on the first account, right, is that this makes it this

10:55.660 --> 11:00.060
kind of makes me think about all the death and destruction in a slightly more darker

11:00.060 --> 11:05.740
way and that like, you know, these people are, you know, whether or not, you know, because

11:05.740 --> 11:11.260
we still need reporting done on what the AI, what the actual artificial intelligence is.

11:11.260 --> 11:15.140
But like you like you said off the top, it doesn't really matter whether what the

11:15.140 --> 11:20.860
configuration is. Right. This is one of the risk of AI being promulgated like this, which

11:20.860 --> 11:26.260
is that it sanitizes monstrous crimes because data is neutral.

11:26.340 --> 11:31.540
Right. Because a collation via algorithm is neutral because automation is neutral.

11:31.540 --> 11:32.860
These are not political things.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.580
These are categories that are outside of human cognition.

11:37.620 --> 11:43.980
And as thus we can refer to them, we can embody them, we can reinforce them because

11:43.980 --> 11:47.260
they're not flawed, biased, so on and so forth.

11:47.740 --> 11:52.220
So sickening because it probably also reveals an even like greater pathology about the

11:52.220 --> 11:57.340
children that are being murdered, about the, you know, the young men and women that are

11:57.340 --> 12:03.100
being murdered, about the civilians that are being murdered, right, that in one way or

12:03.100 --> 12:10.220
another, not only is there already the racism, incumbent and Zionism, and especially this

12:10.220 --> 12:16.900
genocide of Palestinians, but then there's also this insistence that might emerge even

12:16.900 --> 12:20.900
from people who might not have that or might take pause with that, that, well, you know,

12:20.900 --> 12:26.700
the mass murder is reciprocal and neutral, you know, because the data is just leading

12:26.700 --> 12:30.980
us in that direction. And then on the second count, also sickening in a way that we'll

12:30.980 --> 12:38.340
talk more about later in the episode, just like, you know, this, this is, this is the

12:38.340 --> 12:43.860
fucking fire this time, you know, and what are people doing?

12:43.860 --> 12:49.380
What are people in the AI ethics and the AI risk and the AI safety community saying

12:49.380 --> 12:54.900
about this, about a system where whether or not AI is actually in a role of it, a military

12:54.900 --> 13:03.220
is proudly saying, we named this thing the gospel. It's job, find people to kill. What

13:03.220 --> 13:11.780
does it do? Help us kill as many people as possible. Seems like the worst possible scenario

13:11.780 --> 13:17.940
and the perfect one for all of these industries and cottage factories and all these fuckers

13:17.940 --> 13:26.660
to speak up and say anything. How many have a handful? If that, right, you can, you can

13:26.660 --> 13:32.420
guess if you're sitting at home, you can probably guess who has said literally anything about

13:32.420 --> 13:38.900
this and deals with those fields. And you'd be almost certainly right on those instances.

13:38.980 --> 13:45.540
I guess who would say this? And you'd be wrong because a lot of those people have not said

13:45.540 --> 13:51.300
anything. That is also true. That's another thing to say that there also are some notable

13:51.300 --> 13:58.500
notable signs. Yes. Um, and so it's like, okay, well, what's going on here? You know,

13:58.500 --> 14:06.820
because I find it hard to believe it's either they don't know about it or, you know, as

14:06.820 --> 14:10.180
we have talked about, and as other people have talked about, you know, for example,

14:10.180 --> 14:15.060
Khadija over at logic, my editor, you know, has talked about, there's just like a moral

14:15.780 --> 14:21.460
failure in the core framework about how we think about AI ethics and safety and risk

14:21.460 --> 14:27.300
that makes the framework almost useless, right? Like maybe from an outside in perspective,

14:27.940 --> 14:33.460
we can all agree and understand that things should not be developed mindlessly and that

14:33.460 --> 14:40.020
there are real consequences to taking data that's constructed in biased means and racist

14:40.020 --> 14:45.460
means from a society that has its own politics and its own social relations and its own economics

14:45.460 --> 14:50.420
and its own history and its own culture, that things will bleed through and, you know,

14:50.420 --> 14:57.140
result in the creation of data sets or result in the deployment of weapons and surveillance in

14:57.140 --> 15:03.140
ways that discriminate and hurt certain people. But the industries as they actually are,

15:03.140 --> 15:11.220
AI safety, AI risk, AI ethics, they're corporate captured, you know, industries,

15:11.220 --> 15:16.980
and what are, you know, what are, that are doing what? Soaking up all the academic talent

15:16.980 --> 15:24.100
and critical thinkers and critics, hoarding all the resources and the access to the data and to

15:24.100 --> 15:30.580
the computational infrastructure, right? And sucking the air out of any real critique

15:31.540 --> 15:34.740
of how artificial intelligence is talked about, thought about, deployed,

15:34.740 --> 15:41.940
and integrated into things that leaves us within a moment where these motherfuckers are building a

15:41.940 --> 15:48.660
Death Star, you know, like a literal fucking Death Star aimed at civilians in a place that

15:48.660 --> 15:54.420
they occupy and are doing a genocide in, everybody shuts the fuck up. You know, is this, it's useless.

15:54.420 --> 15:59.140
It's useless. I don't, we don't even need, we don't even need, what more do we need to say about it

15:59.220 --> 16:02.580
other than that? If in the moment where there's a literal genocide happening,

16:03.460 --> 16:10.100
most of them are silent. It's so fucking frustrating. And it's even more frustrating

16:10.100 --> 16:16.740
when you read the piece, right? Because the piece makes it very clear, whatever the system is,

16:17.780 --> 16:22.820
it has massively expanded the capabilities, right? Where in previous operations,

16:22.820 --> 16:28.100
they were happy to get maybe 100 targets a year. And now they're generating as many targets as

16:28.100 --> 16:33.860
they did in a year inside of a day because what they're doing or what they claim to be doing with

16:33.860 --> 16:42.900
this AI system is that they will take, hey, this is, this is the address of a spokesperson for Hamas.

16:42.900 --> 16:48.580
Hey, this is a militant that we know is in this group. Hey, this is like, you know, someone who

16:48.580 --> 16:52.820
was spotted at some sort of demonstration or resistance. This is someone we arrested or picked

16:52.820 --> 16:59.220
up and saying, okay, this is where they live. This is where they work. Are these places affiliated

16:59.220 --> 17:05.860
with Hamas? Probably not. But because this person lives there or works there or has been there,

17:06.740 --> 17:13.460
we can blow that shit to shit, blow it to shit. You know, there's just one really striking

17:13.940 --> 17:25.140
paragraph. I think it's pretty demonstrative both of the danger in this AI system existing

17:25.140 --> 17:30.980
and then also in the fact that we can say that and not get caught up on how much of it is AI or not

17:30.980 --> 17:38.180
because at the end of the day, it's a digital system or piece of technology that's being used

17:38.180 --> 17:43.140
by people who are already looking for a certain problem to be served in a certain way.

17:43.220 --> 17:50.180
Solved in a certain way and they have the solution in the way that they deploy it. So we have,

17:50.180 --> 17:59.780
at one point, this guy says, you know, first I'll step back and kind of explain one of the

17:59.780 --> 18:08.340
insights of the report. In case you might not have known, you know, and as 972 and local call kind

18:08.340 --> 18:16.660
of talk about, there are four categories and targets that are struck by Israeli aircraft.

18:16.660 --> 18:22.660
The first are tactical targets, right? And so, you know, these are supposed to be standard military

18:22.660 --> 18:27.380
targets. These are arm cells. These are places where weapons are being held. These are actual

18:27.380 --> 18:32.260
weapons themselves, rocket launchers, anti-tank missile launchers, launch pits, mortar bombs,

18:32.260 --> 18:37.380
military headquarters, observation posts, and so on. The second are hardened underground targets,

18:37.380 --> 18:45.220
the tunnels that Hamas uses as well as the tunnels that span through Gaza and underneath

18:45.220 --> 18:51.860
Gaza's neighborhoods that are part of the network that brings in goods since Israel's

18:51.860 --> 18:59.780
maintaining a blockade. Then, you know, strikes of these targets are not as clear as the first one

18:59.780 --> 19:05.940
because a lot of these tunnels are under civilians, right? They're homes. They're actual

19:05.940 --> 19:13.380
infrastructure, the centers of their life, universities, hospitals. You know, you strike

19:13.380 --> 19:17.700
that, you're going to kill a massive amount of people, right? Not that that's going to stop them.

19:18.340 --> 19:24.820
The third are power targets, as they call them, and these are high rises, residential towers,

19:25.380 --> 19:32.900
public buildings, right? These are things that where you hit them, you're hitting not just a place,

19:32.900 --> 19:38.020
you know, not just a neighborhood, not just a place where people work, but like a center

19:38.020 --> 19:42.740
of a section of the life, of the rhythm of a city, of a community, right? You're killing the

19:42.740 --> 19:46.340
university, you're killing the banks, you're killing the government offices, you're killing

19:46.340 --> 19:52.500
hospitals, you're killing office buildings and commercial areas. You're crippling the city,

19:52.500 --> 19:57.460
essentially, right? And you're crippling the ability of people to do anything other than

19:57.460 --> 20:02.020
cower in their homes, which you're going to bomb anyway, right? And the idea here,

20:02.020 --> 20:10.500
as self-admitted by the Israeli intelligence sources, is that if we hit these power targets,

20:10.500 --> 20:19.700
we place pressure on Hamas, that Palestinian society will reject Hamas. Sidebar, war crime.

20:20.260 --> 20:32.740
You know, you can't bomb civilians collectively punishing them for something that groups,

20:32.740 --> 20:37.060
in this case, Hamas is done, right? Not that that matters, but that will come back to be relevant

20:37.060 --> 20:42.180
later. And then the final category are family homes or operatives homes, right? And so these

20:42.180 --> 20:51.220
are homes where, these are targets where you suspect one person in that residence is in Hamas

20:51.220 --> 20:58.180
or the Islamic Jihad, right? And you bomb it so that you might be able to get that one person,

20:58.180 --> 21:02.100
even though as other, and as we'll talk about other reporting reveals, a lot of the times,

21:03.540 --> 21:09.140
the houses that people say are, you know, that houses that the IDF says we're holding, one

21:09.140 --> 21:14.740
militant or one operative of the Islamic Jihad actually didn't. And in fact, they just killed

21:14.740 --> 21:19.380
huge amount of civilians, right? And so 972 writes that, you know,

21:20.420 --> 21:26.900
the Israeli army had really been focusing on the third and fourth categories this time

21:27.620 --> 21:35.700
in response to October 7th, in response to Hamas' operation on October 7th. And that,

21:36.660 --> 21:40.820
they write, according to statements on October 11th by the IDF spokesperson,

21:40.820 --> 21:48.660
during the first five days of fighting, half the targets bombed, 1,329 out of a total 2,687

21:48.660 --> 21:53.700
were deemed power targets. And so here's the quote. One source said, we are asked to look

21:53.700 --> 22:00.180
for high rise buildings with half a floor that can be attributed to Hamas. Sometimes it is a

22:00.180 --> 22:06.580
militant group spokesperson office or a point where operatives meet. I understood that the

22:06.580 --> 22:11.780
floor is an excuse that allows the army to cause a lot of destruction in Gaza. This is what they

22:11.780 --> 22:17.620
told us. If they would tell the whole world that the Islamic Jihad offices on the 10th floor are

22:17.620 --> 22:23.940
not important as a target, but that its existence is a justification to bring down the entire high

22:23.940 --> 22:29.700
rise with the aim of pressuring civilian families who live in it in order to put pressure on terrorist

22:29.700 --> 22:35.940
organizations, this would itself be seen as terrorism. So they do not say it. Yeah,

22:35.940 --> 22:43.060
because that's terrorism. That is literally the textbook definition of terrorism. When we went

22:43.060 --> 22:52.500
into the fucking Middle East and the phase of the invasions premised on the idea that we have

22:52.500 --> 22:58.660
evidence. This is when we were still trying to figure out what the war aims were going to be.

22:58.660 --> 23:04.740
We have evidence that Osama bin Laden was responsible for 9-11. Give him over to us

23:04.740 --> 23:09.780
in senior leadership who's involved in planning it and we won't invade. Okay. Do you have evidence?

23:09.780 --> 23:15.860
Yeah. Will you give us the evidence? No. Okay. Then we're not going to hand him over. It was

23:15.940 --> 23:24.100
more or less the exchange in the early years. So we invaded. There are very clear guidelines

23:24.100 --> 23:28.980
in international law on what you're supposed to do. You don't have to follow them when you

23:28.980 --> 23:33.860
have the largest military in the world. An insistence to follow them is deemed as

23:33.860 --> 23:45.860
unpatriotic, naive, simple-minded, apologism for terrorism when in reality it's to present

23:45.860 --> 23:54.020
situations like this, where you have Israel bombing, flying anything that moves on anything

23:54.020 --> 24:02.100
that moves so that they can do what? Clear out Gaza as part of what is the very transparent

24:02.100 --> 24:06.660
genocide of Palestinians so that they can come in and eventually settle the northern and the

24:06.660 --> 24:14.740
southern strips of Gaza. So what I was saying earlier about whether or not the role of AI here

24:15.620 --> 24:21.220
as it gets fleshed out in future reporting, we see here the thing that we've talked about as an

24:21.220 --> 24:31.060
actual risk of artificial intelligence. There's a problem. Israel wants justification for killing

24:31.060 --> 24:37.780
as many civilians as possible for clearing out buildings in Gaza, for terrorizing Palestinian

24:37.780 --> 24:44.420
society. Solution, argue that the reason you're doing the thing that you've been planning on

24:44.420 --> 24:51.300
doing that you have actually been doing for the past few decades is because of a new technology

24:51.300 --> 25:00.660
that allows you to collate disparate threads of intelligence and pinpoint with computational

25:00.660 --> 25:10.820
sanitation or cleanliness exactly what parts of Palestinian society you need to press on to make

25:10.820 --> 25:17.540
Hamas screen because that's really what it comes down to. Whether or not

25:18.900 --> 25:23.620
AI, there's an actual real automated system here or it's a bunch of people who still have to review

25:24.420 --> 25:28.900
the system and are still doing the final say on everything or it's a bunch of people just signing

25:28.900 --> 25:32.900
off. Whatever it is, it's very clear what's happening here, which is one of the things

25:32.900 --> 25:38.980
we should be concerned about as an AI risk, which is that people are going to use it to justify some

25:39.780 --> 25:45.940
incredibly immoral thing that they're eager to do by saying that, well, the computer is just turning

25:45.940 --> 25:51.860
out the numbers. I'm just in the Chinese box. I'm just following orders. I'm just translating

25:51.860 --> 25:58.660
reality based on what this thing is finding out there. And that, again, it's just like it's

25:58.660 --> 26:04.340
so insane. This is like one of the earliest parts of the article, right? This is one of the earliest

26:04.340 --> 26:12.340
and such unambiguous war crime material, AI risk material things, silence, silence from that sector.

26:14.420 --> 26:22.500
Yeah, the silence is deafening. Really, truly, the silence is deafening. And you're exactly

26:22.500 --> 26:30.260
right here. When we get into, and we will very shortly, more into Habsora, which is the name

26:30.260 --> 26:38.020
of this system. And as you said, that translates to English from Hebrew as the gospel, which,

26:39.700 --> 26:44.500
talk about the direct link to the episode we just released as well.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.180
Yeah, about making God.

26:46.980 --> 26:57.460
About making God, using AI to make God, and using AI to justify the techno fascism through

26:57.460 --> 27:08.100
religiosity. You name your mass assassination factory, the gospel, as if it is the voice of

27:08.180 --> 27:19.620
God telling you where to drop tens of thousands of tons of bombs on all these

27:19.620 --> 27:26.180
quote unquote power targets. It's so unambiguous here. It's so unambiguous. And like you said,

27:26.180 --> 27:34.580
it doesn't matter if it's truly some AI automated system. Even though, I mean,

27:34.580 --> 27:39.860
it is telling, and we'll get to this later as well, that IDF people are explicitly saying

27:40.420 --> 27:48.020
that they don't have the ability to closely review all of the outputs from the system

27:48.020 --> 27:55.220
because there are just so many, but their whole mandate is quantity. The more targets, the better.

27:55.220 --> 28:01.460
And so they are explicitly, which is a total reversal of everybody else who is always talking

28:01.460 --> 28:09.460
about how, no, no, no, we have careful human review of the outputs from automated systems.

28:09.460 --> 28:14.500
And here the IDF is being like, we don't have time to do all that human review of this shit.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.780
We got bombs to drop.

28:16.420 --> 28:20.900
There was some guy who was just talking the other day on Twitter about how artificial

28:20.900 --> 28:26.660
intelligence is like the printing press, and that it's an inherent good, and everybody is

28:26.660 --> 28:33.620
made more intelligent by the proliferation of AI products, goods, and services.

28:33.620 --> 28:39.380
And when you mentioned and talk about that quantity over quality element,

28:40.580 --> 28:46.580
in some ways it is like the printing press. And in this specific scenario,

28:47.620 --> 28:55.700
getting flooded with junk, with bullshit, with bad data. I don't even want to call it bad data

28:55.700 --> 29:01.140
because that suggests there's good data that the IDF could use. But getting flooded with

29:01.140 --> 29:06.100
information and then using that to just be like, well, we are going to kill them all anyway.

29:06.100 --> 29:15.300
So now at least we have nicely tabulated formal categories and zones of attack and targets

29:15.860 --> 29:19.940
versus having to ad hoc justify why we did a war crime again.

29:19.940 --> 29:27.060
Yeah. And talk about the links to the Obama kill list as well.

29:28.660 --> 29:33.940
The IDF is explicitly saying, they explicitly said, we are not being surgical.

29:37.380 --> 29:43.140
They are just loving to say the loud part, the quiet part loud right now on all of this.

29:43.140 --> 29:48.180
But that is also, I think, really telling here as well where the disposition matrix

29:48.180 --> 29:55.620
and drone warfare was designed to be sanitized through its surgicalness. It was supposed to be

29:56.260 --> 30:02.260
precise, surgical. We have a kill list of individual targets. We have drones that are

30:02.900 --> 30:10.180
dropping smart missiles on people. It's all surgical. It's all precise. It's sanitized.

30:10.500 --> 30:18.740
Here, what we have is an AI system, Haspera, which is cranking out more targets than IDF

30:18.740 --> 30:28.340
intelligence can keep up with. Those targets are leading. They are the justification.

30:30.660 --> 30:39.380
Ultimately, it doesn't really matter if the AI is leading you to the power targets or the AI is

30:39.380 --> 30:45.620
the justification for bombing power targets you already want to bomb. At the end of the day,

30:45.620 --> 30:55.220
it's the same output where the IDF is claiming that the AI is leading them through this network

30:55.220 --> 31:03.300
analysis to these targets. And then all they do is if a target is spit out, then they bomb it.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.900
Targets spit out, they bomb it. Targets spit out, they bomb it.

31:09.700 --> 31:17.700
It does seem to be a really nice coincidence for the IDF that so many of the targets that are being

31:17.700 --> 31:28.660
spit out by Hapsora are targets that their military strategy is focused on. As you said

31:29.380 --> 31:36.740
from the 972 reporting power targets, so the high-rise buildings, the universities,

31:36.740 --> 31:44.900
the hospitals, the infrastructure. It's not even shock and awe. It's shock and massacre

31:44.900 --> 31:49.300
because also the fourth target that you mentioned is the family home.

31:49.300 --> 32:00.260
So Hapsora is pointing them to power targets and family homes. It explains why if you are

32:00.260 --> 32:05.540
paying attention to what's happening in Gaza, the reporting is constantly talking about,

32:05.540 --> 32:14.100
well, Gaza has no more universities. Gaza has no more hospitals. Oh, here's yet another person

32:14.100 --> 32:23.220
who has had more than 30 of their family members killed by Israel. The reporting here as well

32:23.220 --> 32:32.420
around some of those numbers are mind-boggling. It really puts a material human cost on these

32:32.420 --> 32:41.460
systems and strategies. For the IDF for Israel, the technological system and the military strategy

32:41.460 --> 32:48.340
are intimately linked together. They are not able to be disentangled. They are serving each other.

32:48.340 --> 32:57.540
It's not a unidirectional causal flow where the technology leads to the strategy or the strategy

32:57.540 --> 33:03.220
leads. It's bidirectional. It's a relationship. They are mutually reinforcing each other.

33:03.780 --> 33:13.620
We can see this in the material human cost that is being reported. We're recording this. It's

33:14.340 --> 33:18.260
December 6. I'll just put a time date on it because this is all moving so fast.

33:21.300 --> 33:30.260
This is two months after October 7, after everything started. The report that we're seeing

33:30.740 --> 33:41.460
and that 972 reports on some of the death toll numbers even just from a month into the war,

33:41.460 --> 33:48.420
the massacre, the genocide. There's numbers from November 11 talking about that even by that time,

33:48.420 --> 33:57.220
even a month into it, there were over 300 people who had more than 10 family members killed.

33:57.620 --> 34:07.700
Then there were hundreds of people who had seven to nine family members killed,

34:07.700 --> 34:17.060
hundreds more that had five family members. The death tolls here are only able to be

34:17.060 --> 34:24.020
comprehended, I think, as incomprehensible as they are by understanding it as an outcome of

34:24.980 --> 34:33.780
the bombing power targets in family homes. It is a military strategy bolstered by, powered by,

34:33.780 --> 34:41.780
justified by, sanitized by a technological system that is designed to not just cause

34:42.340 --> 34:50.500
mass destruction but wipe out entire family lineages. This is ethnic cleansing.

34:50.580 --> 35:01.620
This is Nakba. We have to understand that sanitizing nature of the technology is also

35:01.620 --> 35:10.340
a cleansing. It's an ethnic cleansing that we see here. A cleansing by wiping away whole lineages

35:10.900 --> 35:16.340
of families, of Palestinian families. You can even hear it when they talk about,

35:17.140 --> 35:22.820
you know, for example, they talk about bombing entire neighborhoods. Like you said,

35:22.820 --> 35:26.900
how they're not surgical. When pressed about it, they're just like, well, you know,

35:27.860 --> 35:32.340
and they've always been, and IDF has always been consistent on this. Neighborhoods are

35:34.020 --> 35:40.500
just tamas recruiting grounds. They're terror nests. They're operational headquarters.

35:41.060 --> 35:46.100
Civilians are operational assets. Residents inside of these buildings are assets that might

35:46.100 --> 35:50.740
be used by the terrorist buildings. Like no one's a person. Everyone's a potential terrorist

35:51.940 --> 35:59.220
or a subhuman that's waiting to be purged. And now we have this technological implementation

35:59.220 --> 36:05.300
that just so happens to agree with us, right? Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, I want to get

36:05.300 --> 36:13.700
into the technology a bit more too. But before, you know, I'll do that right now. But before I do,

36:13.700 --> 36:19.860
you know, I mentioned the kill, the Obama kill list. The way this technology works and the way

36:19.860 --> 36:28.100
it's being used also really strikes me as being extremely similar to Palantir, right? The network

36:28.100 --> 36:36.980
analysis that Palantir has created, which was as we should always remember and always mention,

36:37.780 --> 36:45.300
you know, Palantir was created with funding from the, in QTEL, the CIA's venture capital

36:46.100 --> 36:52.660
arm. And it was created originally, despite its widespread use now in public health,

36:53.380 --> 36:59.540
in finance and policing and mineral extraction, you know, despite all of that,

37:00.020 --> 37:07.860
it was originally created for the war on terror. It was created as a tool for the CIA. It was

37:07.860 --> 37:14.340
created as a tool for the Pentagon. It was created to do this kind of network analysis,

37:14.340 --> 37:21.380
as they call it, to find terror cells, right? And how do they do that? Well, the whole idea

37:21.380 --> 37:28.740
is that they were going to create networks of associations with people, right? You create a

37:28.740 --> 37:36.500
network of all of the people associated with somebody, all of the addresses associated with

37:36.500 --> 37:44.820
them, the locations, the vehicles, everything that you possibly can, every object or relationship

37:44.820 --> 37:50.420
that you can associate with somebody, you map that into this big, giant network. And the idea

37:50.420 --> 37:56.180
is that through that, you are able to map these terror cells, right? You're able to see how,

37:56.900 --> 38:05.300
oh, these people have a vehicle in common with each other. We've got data that at independent

38:05.300 --> 38:14.500
times, these three people have used this same vehicle. Okay, maybe that's an Al-Qaeda vehicle.

38:15.460 --> 38:22.500
That was the whole idea of Palantir, is to create this network analysis, specifically to map out

38:22.820 --> 38:29.220
these terror cells, to map out their associations with addresses, with vehicles, with families,

38:29.220 --> 38:38.580
with friends, with whoever, with whatever, with wherever, and then as a way to then create targets

38:39.460 --> 38:49.860
to do an enhanced interrogation of, to assassinate, right? Whatever it is that you're doing,

38:50.500 --> 38:58.500
all of the terrible things, that is also, it sounds to me like the way Hapsara works is very,

38:58.500 --> 39:06.660
very similar to that kind of network analysis, right? I think it's also important to keep in

39:06.660 --> 39:15.700
mind all of these technological lineages that we see here, that as absolutely fucking terrifying,

39:15.700 --> 39:24.740
horrendous and shocking as this is, it is also not unprecedented. It is very much in a, which

39:24.740 --> 39:34.420
means it's not unpredictable either, or unpredicted. It is in a long precedent and lineage of how these

39:34.500 --> 39:38.900
technologies are designed, how they're created, and what they are used for.

39:38.900 --> 40:05.700
So, let's talk a little bit about 972's reporting on Hapsara so that we can understand as well.

40:06.580 --> 40:12.660
We talked about the military strategy here of focusing on power targets and family homes.

40:12.660 --> 40:17.780
Let's talk about the technological system that is powering that and justifying that, right?

40:18.500 --> 40:22.980
I'm actually just going to quote some from 972 because I think they really clearly

40:23.620 --> 40:27.940
lay it out and I don't want to mince their careful wording here.

40:28.180 --> 40:34.100
According to intelligence sources, Hapsara, which, as a side note, remember, this translates as

40:34.100 --> 40:41.300
the gospel. So, always keep that in mind too. According to intelligence sources, Hapsara generates,

40:41.300 --> 40:48.100
among other things, automatic recommendations for attacking private residences where people suspected

40:48.100 --> 40:55.220
of being Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives live. Israel then carries out large-scale assassination

40:55.700 --> 41:01.700
operations through the heavy shelling of these residential homes.

41:01.700 --> 41:07.860
Side note as well, this is not our common imagination of assassination.

41:09.780 --> 41:18.660
We now think of assassination as Assassin's Creed or as Hitman or as Navy SEALs or James Bond.

41:19.460 --> 41:27.860
As this thing that happens in secret and with surgical precision, no. For Israel, assassination

41:27.860 --> 41:35.700
means heavy shelling of residential homes. It is literally shooting a passenger plane out of the

41:35.700 --> 41:42.740
sky not because there's a Hamas operative on the plane, but because a Hamas operative once sat on

41:42.740 --> 41:55.140
a seat in the plane. That is what's happening here. Hapsara, as one of the sources explained,

41:55.140 --> 42:01.220
processes enormous amounts of data that, quote, tens of thousands of intelligence officers could

42:01.220 --> 42:08.660
not process and recommends bombing sites in real time because most senior Hamas officials head into

42:08.660 --> 42:13.940
underground tunnels with the start of any military operation, the sources say. The use

42:13.940 --> 42:20.340
of a system like Hapsara makes it possible to locate and attack the homes of relatively junior

42:20.340 --> 42:26.580
operatives. One former intelligence officer explained that the Hapsara system enables the

42:26.580 --> 42:34.180
army to run a, quote, unquote, mass assassination factory in which the, quote, emphasis is on

42:34.180 --> 42:40.420
quantity and not on quality. A human eye will go over the targets before each attack,

42:40.420 --> 42:45.380
but it need not spend a lot of time on them, said the former intelligence officer.

42:46.020 --> 42:52.580
Since Israel estimates that there are approximately 30,000 Hamas members in Gaza and they are all

42:52.580 --> 43:00.180
marked for death, the number of potential targets is enormous. In 2019, the Israeli

43:00.180 --> 43:07.700
army created a new center aimed at using AI to accelerate target generation. As the former IDF

43:07.700 --> 43:13.380
chief of staff said in an in-depth interview with YNET earlier this year, quote, the target's

43:13.380 --> 43:19.940
administrative division is a unit that includes hundreds of officers and soldiers and is based on

43:19.940 --> 43:27.060
AI capabilities. The IDF chief of staff went on to say, quote, this is a machine that with the help

43:27.060 --> 43:34.180
of AI processes a lot of data better and faster than any human and translates it into targets

43:34.180 --> 43:40.660
for attack. The result was that in Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021, from the moment

43:40.660 --> 43:46.660
this machine was activated, it generated 100 new targets every day. You see, in the past,

43:46.660 --> 43:52.260
there was times in Gaza when we would create 50 targets per year, and here the machine produced

43:52.260 --> 43:59.460
100 targets in one day. We prepare the targets automatically and work according to a checklist,

43:59.460 --> 44:05.780
one of the sources who worked in the new targets administrative division told 972 and Local Call.

44:05.780 --> 44:11.700
Quote, it really is like a factory. We work quickly and there is no time to delve deep into

44:11.700 --> 44:17.220
the target. The view is that we are judged according to how many targets we manage to generate.

44:18.100 --> 44:25.220
So, I mean, that's Hapsara in a nutshell. That's the gospel in a nutshell. It is about

44:25.220 --> 44:33.220
maximizing. Calling it a mass assassination factory is actually the most apt description you have

44:33.220 --> 44:41.060
because it is truly about mass production. It is Fordism for genocide, right? It is about maximizing

44:41.060 --> 44:48.980
the quantity of target generation and then responding to those targets in an automated way

44:48.980 --> 44:55.380
of, you know, as I said before, target generated, bomb dropped, target generated, bomb dropped,

44:55.380 --> 45:02.020
and you just, and the whole job is to keep up with the factory line, spitting out targets,

45:02.020 --> 45:10.260
no review, no oversight for quality, no concerns about the morality or legality of it, right?

45:10.260 --> 45:16.500
But instead, the AI provides justification. You know, the AI is giving you targets of

45:16.500 --> 45:22.900
her mass operatives. It's not our fault that they use human shields, whether it be

45:24.180 --> 45:30.500
their own families or hospitals or schools or mosque, you know, it's not our fault,

45:30.500 --> 45:36.340
but we got to kill the Hamas operative, you know, and so if we have to, you know, hey,

45:36.340 --> 45:42.020
we're not the one holding the human shield, right? But we are blowing it apart. I mean,

45:44.100 --> 45:49.940
this is what's happening here, right? I think, you know, to go back as well to some of the real,

45:49.940 --> 45:57.620
the deafening silence of the fact that people are, like, why are the people that we follow,

45:57.620 --> 46:04.580
the people that are in our networks, the people we know, who are, like, always, who are so concerned

46:04.580 --> 46:11.140
about the ethics and politics and impacts of AI, why is this not the thing everyone is screaming

46:11.140 --> 46:16.020
their head off about right now? Or at least linking to the article, right? I've not even seen

46:16.020 --> 46:23.860
people link to the article, you know, like, why? It doesn't make sense to me, especially when,

46:23.860 --> 46:32.420
you know, if you consider how much attention it receives, how loudly people crow

46:33.380 --> 46:39.940
when, and rightfully so, whenever there's a similar kind of automated system that is

46:40.980 --> 46:48.420
targeting people for welfare fraud, right? And like, as we've seen, as we see in recent reporting

46:48.420 --> 46:54.420
in France, as we talked about with the Dutch algorithm, as we've talked about with Australia,

46:54.420 --> 46:58.420
as we talked about in the US, right? Like, as we've talked about in the UK, right? These systems

46:58.660 --> 47:04.340
exist all over the place, right? These AI systems or automated systems that target people

47:05.540 --> 47:14.020
with risk scores, label them as welfare frauds, and then deny them their welfare benefits,

47:14.020 --> 47:22.340
trap them in these labyrinthine bureaucratic systems, deprive them of the resources and aid

47:22.340 --> 47:28.820
that they not only need, but are due, right? That they deserve. Anytime that happens,

47:29.460 --> 47:36.420
there is so much attention to it, right? There is so much writing about it, you know,

47:36.420 --> 47:42.020
yelling about it, and rightfully so. It's truly awful. And yet, when we see a system that is

47:42.020 --> 47:47.700
doing much the same, but not to deprive you of welfare benefits, but to deprive you of your life,

47:47.700 --> 47:54.100
to deprive you of your entire family, to deprive you of your communities, to deprive you of your

47:54.100 --> 48:00.420
land, to deprive you of everything that you have, and everything that you will ever have.

48:01.460 --> 48:08.020
When we see a system doing that, people just are suddenly clamped up, you know? Are they too

48:08.020 --> 48:17.220
shocked to talk? Why is it that it seems to be more morally reprehensible to deprive a Palestinian

48:17.220 --> 48:23.780
of their welfare benefits than it is to deprive them of their life and their whole family? Why?

48:23.780 --> 48:33.300
I don't understand. Have we reached the limits of politics where it is so horrendous that we

48:33.300 --> 48:39.540
can't even speak of it? Have we reached the limits of morality and legality where actually,

48:39.540 --> 48:44.980
this is justified, that the people deserve it, that, hey, I can see both sides of the issue,

48:44.980 --> 48:52.660
and it's a land of contrast? None of that holds water for me. I don't understand.

48:53.940 --> 49:00.580
I mean, it's cowardice, right? I mean, it's cowardice. Khadijah wrote a long time about

49:00.580 --> 49:08.180
this in an article that I think got a lot of people to pay attention to. It was called

49:08.180 --> 49:12.660
on the moral collapse of AI ethics, right? And it was talking about how a lot of people are

49:12.660 --> 49:22.100
focusing on the firing of Timnit Gebru and the firing shows that Google is fucked, right? But

49:22.980 --> 49:29.060
there are also other questions and debates and discussions we should have, like the fact that AI

49:29.060 --> 49:33.540
ethics is a fundamentally limited thing, especially if we're talking about AI ethics in Google.

49:34.740 --> 49:40.820
We've already lost the plot if we think that a firing at Google is the problem, because the

49:40.820 --> 49:52.180
problem is even larger than the fact that Google has a specific engagement with the AI ethics

49:52.180 --> 49:58.500
community, right? It scales up to the fact that even our ideas about what AI ethics looks like

49:58.500 --> 50:04.900
are just nonsense, right? Because they don't begin with a fundamentally antagonistic relationship

50:04.900 --> 50:13.140
or engagement towards how capitalism and specifically racial capitalism has created

50:13.140 --> 50:19.940
and spurred along the development of deeply discriminatory and exploitative and extractive

50:19.940 --> 50:25.220
technologies. We talk about it all the time. Most of the technology we have in this world

50:25.220 --> 50:31.780
that people crow about is just an exotic way to surveil on another person or to kill another

50:31.780 --> 50:37.300
person. That's most of the shit. That's most of the shit that everyone is excited about all the

50:37.300 --> 50:42.580
fucking time, right? And so when we are over here talking about AI ethics, a lot of the time it's

50:42.580 --> 50:46.420
like, well, how do we make a more humane way of killing other human beings? Or how do we make a

50:46.420 --> 50:52.980
more humane way of surveilling other people, right? Fundamentally. And to lose sight of that is to have

50:52.980 --> 51:00.660
lost the plot. And most people in that field or industry in one way or another have lost the plot,

51:00.660 --> 51:05.700
which is not to say there are a lot of people I know and respect who are in these fields,

51:05.700 --> 51:11.620
right? But the ones whose work I really love and look to and read and think about are also grappling

51:11.620 --> 51:16.820
with the fact that there are fundamental limits here, right? And that the real problem is how do

51:16.820 --> 51:22.260
we get out of it? What's the off ramp? How do you get out of this stupid fucking discussion?

51:22.260 --> 51:29.060
Well, the question is, do we do a one-year moratorium on Apple's facial recognition software

51:29.060 --> 51:34.260
inside of its ring surveillance cameras that it gives to police departments for free or a two-year

51:34.260 --> 51:42.580
moratorium instead of why the fuck is a delivery company giving surveillance cameras to police

51:42.580 --> 51:51.460
departments and giving them facial recognition software when it's misidentifying black and

51:51.460 --> 51:55.700
brown people at a ridiculous rate? Why is that? What's going on there? Well,

51:58.660 --> 52:04.660
good luck really having a great discussion with that. And even, as Skedija points out,

52:06.340 --> 52:10.420
even the engagement that we do get with that in the form of surveillance capitalism

52:10.420 --> 52:18.420
falls short. The idea of surveillance as a service is still fundamentally blunted once

52:18.420 --> 52:22.660
she writes that the larger point is even our language is failing us because we're too often

52:22.660 --> 52:27.220
fighting to save a democracy that modernity has foreclosed. We need a radical reframing away from

52:27.220 --> 52:33.540
the lone researcher against Goliath to reckon with the failures of fairness, accountability,

52:33.540 --> 52:38.820
transparency, and broader ethics frameworks that have allowed opportunists to build their brand,

52:38.820 --> 52:44.100
taking up space required to address the core issues of big tax hegemonic violence as described

52:44.100 --> 52:53.860
in Timnit's paper. I'll also quote at length because I think that I really encourage you to

52:53.860 --> 52:57.940
check out the writings from a few years ago, but it's still poignant. I think about it,

52:57.940 --> 53:02.500
think about it especially with this piece. She writes, if you were shocked by the firing

53:02.500 --> 53:06.900
of Timnit, you haven't been paying attention. We need to fucking take responsibility for the

53:06.900 --> 53:11.780
present because while you're immobilized, debating whether if you're the one who should mention the

53:11.780 --> 53:17.380
corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion lexicon inherently decoupled from political

53:17.380 --> 53:25.140
economic analysis is half the problem. The most opportunist and or mediocre are defining the

53:25.140 --> 53:30.980
discourse on a global stage. We're ruminating about Jeff Deans' feelings instead of building

53:30.980 --> 53:38.180
a cross-class labor movement that defines tech workers broadly, i.e. researchers, engineers,

53:38.180 --> 53:43.300
Uber drivers, Amazon warehouse workers, content moderators, etc. We should cry out,

53:43.300 --> 53:48.100
not because Timnit is a brilliant scientist who shaped her field, but because her firing

53:48.100 --> 53:53.700
is a symptom of a broken society we've constructed. She isn't fucked, we're all fucked.

53:54.500 --> 53:57.780
The academics and computer scientists claiming they will no longer volunteer their free labor

53:57.780 --> 54:02.900
when it comes time to reviewing Google academic submissions should be commended. Whoever they

54:02.900 --> 54:07.780
should ask themselves, what is it about the high-minded ideals of unimpeded academic freedom

54:07.780 --> 54:12.900
that were so divorced from the praxis that research was enabling? Saying that phrenology

54:12.900 --> 54:19.140
was conducted rigorously is insufficient. That issue isn't Google or language models or Jeff

54:19.140 --> 54:24.260
Dean, rather it is a field that has sold itself to industries that are killing people. That is the

54:24.260 --> 54:33.460
crux of the thing. That's where it comes down home to. Israel is a perfect either representation or

54:33.460 --> 54:44.180
mirror in our own tech industry. I'll start with Israel first. As we had Anthony Lowenstein come

54:44.180 --> 54:48.740
on to talk about the Palestine laboratory, one of the indispensable roles that Israel plays

54:48.740 --> 54:55.460
in the world is that it battle tests surveillance tech and murder tech on Palestinians and then

54:55.460 --> 55:00.340
exports it to autocratic regimes around the world to suppress minority populations.

55:01.300 --> 55:10.580
As the climate begins to get worse on climate refugees, silence on that as well as a refusal

55:10.580 --> 55:19.300
to acknowledge that axis of oppression that's going on is a lot of things, but we should also

55:19.300 --> 55:26.420
understand fundamentally is moral cowardice. Part of that is also because the same fucking

55:26.500 --> 55:35.860
thing happens here. The largest sources of legitimacy in the tech industries and in

55:35.860 --> 55:41.060
various fields attached to the tech industry come from how close people are to the money

55:41.060 --> 55:50.260
that's being generated from selling yourself to an industry that kills people. How much money

55:50.260 --> 55:55.780
are you going to be making if you're helping train these drones or do the network analysis

55:55.780 --> 56:01.300
that helps with this targeted assassination or help militarize this or that technology and

56:01.300 --> 56:08.260
application in the field? What kind of innovations to surveillance as a service can you offer

56:09.140 --> 56:15.220
both in terms of the advertising model and also in terms of also just surveillance as a product

56:15.220 --> 56:22.100
that will allow you to tap into other aspects of people's daily lives? We can talk about the

56:22.100 --> 56:27.140
surveillance products that Amazon rolls out without dipping into the limited surveillance

56:27.140 --> 56:32.260
capitalism thing because we can talk about the fact that, again, the ring cameras.

56:33.300 --> 56:38.260
What is a ring camera? A ring camera is not simply like a little surveillance camera

56:38.260 --> 56:44.340
that is offered as a product divorced from reality that you get to buy. A ring camera is a pretty

56:44.340 --> 56:50.340
smart move that ends up playing roles intentional and growing to fill unintentional ones with a

56:50.340 --> 56:55.540
little nudging. When you have a ring camera, you're part of a process where this company gives them

56:55.540 --> 57:01.460
to other people, departments for free, and gins them up in marketing as, look, you live in an

57:01.460 --> 57:09.860
unsafe place. You should have surveillance so that you can protect your property, you can protect

57:09.860 --> 57:14.980
your packages, you can protect your family, ignoring that, for example, a lot of the people

57:14.980 --> 57:19.380
who get them are in places that are already relatively safe and also that a lot of people

57:19.380 --> 57:28.260
who use them are using them to surveil packages that, if you lose them, Amazon refunds you

57:28.900 --> 57:33.380
and you can get them, again, no questions asked. You could get the thing, take it into your home,

57:33.380 --> 57:38.020
say you never got it, and they give it to you, no questions asked. But besides the point on that,

57:38.020 --> 57:43.140
also, you're getting then ingratiated into this network where the idea is we should all be

57:43.140 --> 57:50.740
encouraged in one way or another to sign on to these forms of surveillance as they help out

57:50.740 --> 58:01.780
Amazon. Sometimes that means disciplining or surveilling delivery workers who are already

58:01.780 --> 58:08.580
overworked and underpaid and over-exploited. But then Amazon has created a Byzantine legal

58:08.580 --> 58:12.340
structure to keep hands distance at, so maybe it doesn't have as much control as it might want,

58:12.340 --> 58:19.140
but has more control than it should. Well, the surveillance camera has now allowed people inside

58:19.140 --> 58:24.740
of their homes with the Ring cameras to act as another boss that they have to deal with

58:24.740 --> 58:29.620
while they're still being kept away from Amazon as not being an actual employee of Amazon.

58:31.140 --> 58:37.540
The Ring camera ends up growing and expanding because Ring is going here and saying,

58:37.540 --> 58:41.220
look, Amazon is going here and saying, we have a piece of technology.

58:41.220 --> 58:45.220
And the thing that we're interested in doing is growing it out, one, as surveillance products so

58:45.220 --> 58:49.380
that we can fill our other needs inside of the ecosystem, and two, because we're interested in

58:49.380 --> 58:54.900
exploring whether we can plug it into other goods and services, whether we can garner insights from

58:54.900 --> 59:00.100
there that will get us into maybe creating more network devices in your home, or maybe in figuring

59:00.100 --> 59:05.380
out if we can try to push on to larger and larger groups of people, larger and larger, smaller and

59:05.380 --> 59:11.540
more niche products. You see that the technology quickly grows and expands until it becomes

59:11.540 --> 59:17.220
an all-consuming, it becomes plugged into part of this ever-consuming expansionary goal.

59:18.100 --> 59:23.700
So we can note all that and then also talk about the racial elements that come with racial capitalism

59:23.700 --> 59:27.940
and talk about how a lot of the times the surveillance technology is used to raise its

59:27.940 --> 59:32.100
ends, it's biased against black and brown faces, and even if you correct the bias,

59:32.180 --> 59:36.420
it's still going to be used by institutions, by the police departments, as an example,

59:36.420 --> 59:41.300
by welfare agencies, as we've talked about in previous episodes, to discriminate against

59:41.300 --> 59:46.340
people. Because in the real world, even outside of the corrected data, if you made it neutral

59:46.340 --> 59:53.620
somehow, you still have a racist politics at the end of the day. The idea that you can just create

59:53.620 --> 59:59.940
a piece of tech and debate about the rules that are inscribed on it inside of this narrow

59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.300
application, ignoring the actual society in which it's being deployed in and the people who are

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.620
deploying it is stupid. And it's also cowardice and it's coming usually from people who are

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.340
compensated well enough to ignore that, as it is in the United States, as it is in Israel.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:19.460
Because if you were in Israel and someone was like, oh, what's going on with all the things

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:28.900
that we're testing out on Palestinians? We would find it a little stupid if people were debating

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:34.980
about how high the apartheid border fences should be, or what kind of cameras should be put on them,

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:43.620
or whether the camera should have algorithmic facial recognition services or not, or what types

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:51.380
of labor regimes settlers should be subjecting Palestinians to, what type of schedules of work

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:56.260
they should be subjected to. All of this would be considered quibbling and over a fundamentally

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:02.980
immoral thing. And yet, or I would hope so, because some people don't actually even think

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.060
that there's anything wrong going on with the apartheid system. But nonetheless,

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.940
when we look here and then when some people look out there, they don't see anything wrong.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:18.580
There's nothing wrong to them. And whenever you come across that as a case, it's usually because

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:24.020
of moral cowardice. It's because people who really think that when we say the word AI ethics, AI safety,

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:29.860
AI risk, in their heads, they're talking about the sci-fi shit. They're talking about God going

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.580
in a mech and killing everybody. They're talking about Skynet. They're not talking about here and

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.660
now where there's a fucking genocide going on, or where there's an apartheid going on, where there's

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:50.900
a welfare system going on. And it's a bit insane. It's a bit insane. It speaks to such a deep

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:58.580
moral collapse and rot that the nicest thing you can say about such an industry is that it's useless.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:09.940
Because how do you have that much access to capital? You're soaked by that many corporations.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:18.020
You're isolated and given enough access to academic resources and time and space to develop

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:23.860
them intellectually or synthesize them into some framework. And the best that we come up with

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:32.260
a lot of the times from these ethics, safety, and risks people is checking the boxes on diversity.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.380
I don't know. It's just a fundamental failure. It's disgusting.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:49.220
It is. And I think Khadijah is also dead on here as well, where she says in her essay,

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:55.460
if the room taken up with building individual brands lends itself to researching with those

01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:01.300
most impacted, developing tactical initiatives like a social justice war room, we'd be in a

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:06.020
very different place. I think that's also a big part of it too. A lot of this is, unfortunately,

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:14.900
about building up your brand as the more ethical person in the room. It's not to say that people

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:21.780
don't care about this stuff. I'm not saying that. I don't think people are cynical and they don't

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:29.220
actually care beyond seeing it as an opportunity to build a brand. But we are reaching some limits

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:35.300
here where people have decided the trade off of speaking versus not speaking.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:49.380
I can't take that trade off because it might irreparably damage my brand. It might damage

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:54.580
my ability to do more good in the future. We've got to think effectively about these altruistic

01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:01.060
actions. What's the most good I can do as an activist in the future?

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:12.740
It's cowardice. It's a cowardice. I think it is also based in an ironic fetishism of the technology

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:21.700
itself. We might bang on about those people who fetishize the technology because they think it's

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:28.020
going to make God. It is God. It's going to end the world. It's going to bring utopia. They

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:34.660
fetishize the technology and say, tis, tis, tis. Don't fetishize the technology. At the end of the

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:43.540
day as well, they fetishize the technology. They're concerned about the ethics or morality

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:50.900
or politics or responsibility of AI. Hey, we've got to make it ethical. We've got to make the

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:59.700
technology responsible. Our whole analysis forever has always been a materialist one,

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:08.100
which is focused on not the technology itself but the systems that the technology emerges out of,

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:15.300
plugs into, plays a role in. We talk about the technology because we want to talk about

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:20.740
capital. We talk about the technology because we want to talk about fascism. We talk about

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.740
the technology because we want to talk about genocide. Those are the things we're actually

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:32.500
talking about. We're talking about the ways that the technology gets enrolled into perpetuating,

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:39.540
intensifying, justifying, covering up those other things that actually matter in the world.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:47.860
I guess when the genocide is too out in your face, it's hard to talk about the AI.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.220
Mm-hmm.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:06:03.140
It's too much for me. This story, it hits so close to us as well because it is talking about

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:07.700
how these systems are being used. Ultimately, it doesn't matter, as we've talked about,

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:13.860
if the AI system is actually being used as an artificial intelligence to automate this,

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:26.020
or if it's being used as a movie prop to justify actions that the IDF already wants to take. It

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:31.540
doesn't matter because the material consequences at the end of the day are the same. Part of those

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:38.820
material consequences are getting a lot of people to not talk about it, to not pay attention to it.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:45.780
It's not just justifying the action. It's not just directing the action. It is also getting a

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:53.620
lot of people to not pay attention to the action as well in whatever reason. If anything, a story

01:06:53.620 --> 01:07:00.580
like this about Hapsara, about the gospel, if anything, this should be a clarion call for all

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:09.220
those people who are like, hey, Israel-Palestine conflict, that's not my job description. I study

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:17.620
technology. Well, here you go. Here's a technology to pay attention to. It should be bringing people

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:24.980
into the fold to be like, okay, fuck, all right, I study technology. Okay, I got to pay attention.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.340
This matters, but it's done the opposite.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:35.300
There's this line he has. It's in his The Taming of Tech Criticism piece, which every year

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:44.980
that passes by, his really condemnation and disgust in a very dry, Laconian way that reminds me of

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:54.100
Chomsky's own disgust with public intellectuals feels more and more right when he says that

01:07:54.100 --> 01:08:00.500
disconnected from actual political struggles and social criticism, technology criticism is

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:08.660
just an elaborate but affirmative footnote to the status quo. In more than one way,

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.660
I think that has been the case, right? Because one of the things that I think has dominated,

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:20.340
and it's hard to even figure out, well, it's not hard. I mean, it's easy to talk about,

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.820
but it's also like, I think conservatives and right-wingers are pretty cynical in which it's

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:29.700
easy when you start talking about DEI, for example, and the ways in which a lot of people

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:37.780
have kind of slotted that or assumed that to be a social criticism. When in reality, it doesn't

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:46.100
matter what color the other faces at the table are at the end of the day, right? If the fundamental

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.140
system, well, take whoever's at the table and plug them into a system that still exploits

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:57.060
everyone else who looks a certain way outside of the table, right? You can have an AI ethics,

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:04.340
this call for, for example, for the OpenAI board to be half men and half women, to have POC on it.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:10.100
What the fuck will that, what would that actually do though if we were being tech critics about

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.500
what OpenAI's designs and plans for artificial intelligence are, right?

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:23.620
What would that do to change Sam Altman's attempt to create a firm that has AI hardware

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.780
that every firm has to then rely on if they're interested in developing software?

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:33.620
And similarly, what would that mean or do for criticisms of Israel's apartheid state and

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:40.580
genocide? I mean, they let everyone serve in their military. Does that change the degree to which

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:50.180
they do war crimes? No. Would the AI ethics lens and focusing on this sort of diversity and inclusion

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:56.020
have any real possibility of impact? Would Elbit Systems be more humane in the weapons that it uses

01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:02.340
against Palestinians if it had some Palestinians on the board? These seem a bit silly and maybe

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:07.700
unfair examples to use, but that is one of the places or one of the only places you end up going

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.860
for example, focusing on that DI element, right? If you expand it a little bit more broadly and

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:20.420
quibble about what's going on, as you said, a lot of people insist, well, it's a complicated issue,

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:24.260
that's political. I'm not really concerned about that. I'm just concerned about making sure there's

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:30.260
some sort of equity and outcome, right? But how are you going to achieve that if there's not an

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:34.900
actual political vision and struggle? I mean, part of the reason why Silicon Valley has been

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:40.420
so ascendant is because nobody seems to have another fucking vision, right? For what to

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:45.140
actually do with technology in our daily lives and how to integrate and organize our societies

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:50.340
around it or not around it, right? Where should technology be plugged in and where should it

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:55.300
shouldn't be? What types of weapons, what types of artificial intelligences, what types of systems

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:59.700
are we going to put a hard lock on and what types of systems will we ensure that other people can't

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.860
bypass when we have that hard lock on? What types of capital flows are we going to prohibit? What

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:08.740
types of business activity are we going to prohibit, right? None of these things really

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:17.380
bubble up, except in, of course, relatively radical segments, largely academics, right?

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.700
And activists who are able to articulate these visions, but will have them ignored by the

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:26.740
mainstream, right? Which is largely concerned with just build it perpetually until there's a

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.940
problem. And then when there's a problem, let the people who caused the problem write the rules

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:37.460
about how the problem should be handled, you know? And I worry, my greatest fucking worry with this

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:45.540
is that one, either people in that industry will see it in shrug, right? Or we'll use it

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.260
to do the brand building, right? That Khadija kind of talked about where they say, whoa, whoa,

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:56.820
you know, this is horrible. Not much we can do about it, but, you know, if we listen to my 10

01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:01.780
steps, then we'd be able to prevent that happening in the United States. When the thing is,

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:09.300
you know, it's happening somewhere right now, you know? What, if anything, can we do about that?

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:16.100
I will not, I'm not going to pretend like I would even begin to really know, but the people who do

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:21.060
insist they know, and who pretend to know, and who create their whole identities and brands around

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:27.380
this have been silent and left us without anything. Yeah. And it is always that,

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:32.500
the exact what you just said there as well of like, you know, if we do these 10 steps,

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:39.220
then we can prevent this happening in the U.S., right? Like there is, so often there is this,

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:45.460
like, whether it's explicitly or it's just kind of beneath the surface, there is this kind of idea of

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:52.420
like, man, it'd be wild if that happened to us, you know? Like, I'm glad I can do some remote

01:12:52.420 --> 01:13:00.820
criticism here. You know, I can take up my telescope and look abroad into exotic places

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:08.580
or foreign time periods and be like, man, it'd be wild if this happened, huh? But it is already

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:13.940
happening. Like, there is so much of that, that is the, like, it doesn't matter until you come.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:15.540
Buy my mixtape.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:25.700
But there is so much of that, like, of that, that like moral immediacy as well, where it doesn't

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:30.580
matter unless it's happening to you, or it doesn't matter unless you can conceive of it happening to

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:35.620
you. I mean, it's something we've talked about a ton before around like all of the AI doomerism

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:41.700
stuff. And, you know, it's the, you know, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, whoever, whatever, whatever,

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:47.460
right? The whole idea they have to create like an evil AI God that's going to exterminate the world

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:53.220
is because they are in such powerful and privileged positions that it's like literally

01:13:53.220 --> 01:14:02.980
the only threat they can conceive of to themselves is an evil AI God who destroys everything in the

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:08.900
world, not just them, right? Everything in the world. And, you know, I think you see it a lot

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:15.060
in the way that people do talk about, like, AI ethics or the politics of AI or the consequences

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:26.580
of AI is, you know, so often it is about, like, the bad, hey, bad stuff could happen to other

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:34.180
people, or rather, what if the bad stuff happened to me, you know? And I think it is, you know,

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:39.060
this might be a good place to wrap it up. But I think it's also really telling as well where

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:49.780
you have a system like Hapsara, which its whole design is to generate Hamas targets for

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:57.860
assassination, right? And it has apparently an extremely broad definition of who is classified

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:04.740
as a Hamas operative or a relationship to Hamas. You know, it's like we were talking about before

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:08.980
where it's like, you know, as long as you can justify that there's like, you know, half of a

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:14.660
floor of a 10-story building was at one point related to Hamas, well, then you can take down

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:21.460
the whole building. I think a lot of people might be in for a real rude awakening, too, that, like,

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:30.260
you know, their idea that this activism is, you know, that they are doing a good thing

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:35.060
because they are caring about other, like, foreign people, you know, but except when they reach the

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:42.900
limits of care for foreign people or other time periods or other places or whatever it is that,

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:49.140
like, you know, they can't imagine that this stuff might come for them one day. And so that kind of

01:15:49.140 --> 01:16:00.020
limits their ability to speak out about it, to rally against it, to draw attention to its,

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:07.620
you know, horrendous and atrocious actuality, right? Like, they can't imagine it might come

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:14.580
for them one day. Hey, I'm not a Hamas. I'm not a terrorist. I'm not Palestinian. I'm not a climate

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:20.660
refugee. You know, I'm not any of these things. I don't have to worry about that as much, you know?

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:28.740
But consider as well, it don't take long for all of a sudden those boundaries to get real loose

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:35.220
and real fluid and to start capturing a lot more people than you can think of. You know, I just

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:44.260
think of, like, all of the governments around the world, the UK, Australia, the US, like, all the

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:50.740
governments talking about these massive rallies for Palestinian rights, rallies for ceasefire,

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:59.940
rallies against the Israeli-led genocide. You know, just think about, for example, like,

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:07.380
high up people in the UK government, they're crying, the half million people marching,

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:14.900
the millions of people marching as all Hamas sympathizers, you know? Got a whole lot of Hamas

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:20.340
sympathizers all of a sudden, all these, you know, and it ain't just, you know,

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:28.260
cross-punk leftist out there. You know, if you've been out on the marches, it's just a lot of normal

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:35.620
middle-class families with their kids, you know, out there marching for Palestinian rights,

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:41.540
marching for a ceasefire, marching against genocide. You know, all of those people are

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:48.820
being painted as Hamas operatives or Hamas sympathizers. I mean, listen, it makes them,

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:56.420
it makes them a legitimate target for Habsara to spit out one day in that regard.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:03.940
I have some, yeah, I should tweet out to the IDF. I have information about Donald Trump that might

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:12.340
make him a power target for you guys. May Allah awaken the people and help them to see the

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:18.340
evildoings of Israel and the United States. But yeah, no, I think you're right. All the data

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:26.020
Habsara needs to spit out Trump's name next. Trump Tower. It revealed to us that on the,

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:34.180
on the half of, in one room, in one corner office on the 67th floor, Trump sent out

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:43.860
a tweet that said, may Allah awaken the people, may Allah open the people's eyes and awaken them

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:48.900
to the evildoings of Israel and the United States. We got to take the whole thing down guys. I'm sorry.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:59.060
Fair is fair. Yeah, I mean, this is, you know, we don't need to talk about like,

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:04.580
this is the danger of these systems, because the danger of these systems is already readily

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:10.260
apparent. It is clear and present, right? That like, you know, these systems,

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:17.060
and you know, are causing, right, whether they are causing it directly, they are causing it

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:24.580
in some kind of, you know, giving cover for it, whatever it might be, right? These systems are

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:33.700
already leading to the mass assassination, mass destruction, right? But it doesn't end there,

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:41.700
right? If you can't, if what it takes for someone to relate to this, to empathize, to sympathize,

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:48.740
to speak out against, to scream their head off about if what it takes is for you to conceive

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:56.900
that one day, it might not only affect exotic brown people, or it might not only be some,

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:02.900
you know, sci fi near future. If what it takes is for you to conceive of how you yourself might

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:09.300
get caught up in the system. It don't take a lot of imagination to see how that's not only possible,

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:15.700
but increasingly likely as we see governments act in more and more authoritarian ways,

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:28.820
use technology to justify and expand the powers that they have, use fascist policies and propaganda

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:37.540
to create targets to call people human animals. As the defensemen, as the Israeli defense minister

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:43.140
said after October 7th, quote, we are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:52.340
To consider how that broad categorization of human animals is a fluid and dynamic category

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:58.500
that can begin to include a lot of people in a lot of different places under a lot of certain

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:05.860
circumstances. You don't have to think hard and you don't have to think long to understand how

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:12.980
these systems may not only come for you one day, they are already coming for you.

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:19.380
They are already coming for people who, you know, all around the world, they are already causing

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:27.300
and wreaking death and destruction. No, you're telling me that the IDF who trains with American

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:34.660
police departments might one day export the gospel, which is kind of, you know,

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:39.780
if it weren't so grim, it is kind of funny for them to export the gospel to the United States.

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:45.780
But, you know, that's besides the point. It's dark and grim, actually, right? You're telling

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:54.260
me that they would export that to America? Oh, man, unprecedented. Surely not something that,

01:21:54.500 --> 01:22:00.340
you know, journalists like Anthony Loewenstein have written a whole book about. Surely not

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:08.020
something that we did a long episode with them about this whole very lucrative economy of exporting

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:15.780
the technologies of apartheid and genocide to the rest of the world. No, no, I can't imagine it,

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:24.180
Ed, which is why Aaron, I cannot imagine there and I do not speak. Right. Right.

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:30.820
Fucking hell. Well, I think I'm going to.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:37.140
Don't worry, guys, the next episode will also be depressing.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:42.820
Well, as long as the world keeps beating us down, we have to pass on those beatings to our dear

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:47.700
listeners. The negative project continues. You're absolutely right.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:20.340
Thank you to our dear subscribers. And like I said, this episode will be released very shortly

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:28.500
after it goes up on the Patreon feed. So I will speak to you, all of our listeners who are

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:36.980
non-subscribers, please sign up and support the work that we do. It really does keep us going.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:43.620
And doing these kinds of episodes, having these discussions. And so we appreciate that support,

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:52.020
as always. And more importantly, go fucking talk to people about this stuff. Help spread some

01:23:52.020 --> 01:24:00.260
awareness, some outrage, some attention on these things that really need to be. I mean,

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:08.100
this shit is clearly, I think, just these are these are war crimes. They go against even our

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:15.940
completely inadequate liberal system of international law. These things violate that

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:22.900
to such an extreme degree in such an obvious way. Right. Like these are technologies that

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:37.700
do not deserve to exist and indeed should be outlawed, smashed in every way. These are weapons

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:48.340
of mass destruction, weapons of mass assassination. And as such, we need to talk about it. We need to

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:54.180
bring attention to it. We need to fight against it. We need to advocate against it, whatever it

01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:00.340
takes. You know, but so with that, thank you everybody for listening. Thanks for your support.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:03.700
And we will catch you next time later.

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:39.700
So

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.700
it's

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.700
you
