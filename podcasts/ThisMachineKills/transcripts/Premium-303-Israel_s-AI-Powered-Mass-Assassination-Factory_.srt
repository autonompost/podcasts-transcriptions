1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
When a child is killed in Gaza, it's because somebody made a decision that this killing

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,320
was worth it to hit another target, and this is according to five sources that I've spoken

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,160
with in Israeli intelligence.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,960
In all of the target fires that Israel is bombing right now, the amount of civilians

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,520
that are likely to be killed is written down.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,160
After October 7th, there is a total disregard for Palestinian civilian life, even when hitting

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,240
targets that are either not distinctly military in nature.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,360
And I think that to look at the civilian devastation that is happening right now in Gaza, you have

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,640
to understand that it's a consequence of a particular Israeli war policy.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,840
It is a war policy that has a very loose interpretation of what a military target is, also attacking

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,520
people in civilian spaces.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,440
It is a war policy that centers on deterrents and hitting these power targets that are intended

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:13,320
to place civilian pressure on Hamas, and it is a war policy that is increasingly being

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,840
helped by the use of big data, automation software, and AI.

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,040
My evidence suggests that many, many of the of the civilians who are being killed in Gaza

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,080
are being killed as a result of these policies that I do not think are justifiable policies.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,000
International law experts would call them war crimes.

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Hello comrades.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,200
It's episode 303 of This Machine Kills.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,320
I'm Jaythin, joined by Ed and producer Jeremy in the future.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,880
It's your premium episode for this week, but I'm just going to say right up off the top

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,880
because we are going to get into a topic, into a very long investigative report that

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,040
is fucking stunning and shocking to me, stunning in its content, but also as Ed and I were

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,760
yelling about before recording, stunning in the fact that nobody else is fucking talking

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,800
about it and everyone needs to be talking about it.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,880
While this is a premium episode, largely just because that's how the schedule of our recordings

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,080
worked out, we are going to pretty quickly unlock this one for the free feed because

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,560
this is something that deserves much wider discussion than it's receiving, especially

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,720
among people who like us are constantly crowing about the real material and imminent consequences

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:02,120
of AI and its use by people in power, whether that's corporations or governments, militaries,

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
whatever it might be.

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,760
And yet a lot of people ain't talking about this topic that we got for you all today.

33
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,000
And so we need to, yeah, we need to do our part to at least try to bring some more attention

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to it.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
So let's set the scene here, Ed.

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:34,780
So about a week ago as a recording for us, 972 Magazine in partnership with Local Call,

37
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:45,260
So 972 Magazine is a left-wing politics magazine, politics and news magazine based in Tel Aviv

38
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,860
and Local Call is a Hebrew language publication.

39
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,680
So 972 publishes a lot of investigative reporting from a left-wing perspective about Israel

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,520
and Palestine.

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,900
They're based in Tel Aviv, although they publish a lot of their stuff in English because they

42
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,700
want a big international audience to read it.

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
They want to draw attention to it.

44
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,020
And they've published in partnership with Local Call, which is a Hebrew language based

45
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:28,060
outlet in Israel, this just long and stunning report titled A Mass Assassination Factory

46
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,440
Inside Israel's Calculated Bombing of Gaza.

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,700
And then the deck here is permissive airstrikes on non-military targets and the use of an

48
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,280
artificial intelligence system have enabled the Israeli army to carry out its deadliest

49
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,660
war on Gaza.

50
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:55,420
So this is a really long piece on the systems, the technological systems and the military

51
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:05,220
strategies that are underlying Gaza's current and previous military campaigns, the genocide

52
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,780
that they're waging, the mass destruction that they are committing on Gaza, this AI

53
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,100
system that is really being revealed in this report that we're going to talk about and

54
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:26,860
strategy underlying that this is what is a really kind of massive foundational pillar

55
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,220
behind everything that we see happening in Gaza right now.

56
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,900
And of course, when there's an AI angle, TMK is going to be on the case.

57
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:47,180
But this is striking me as not just a little bit of AI sauce on something else.

58
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,500
This is really striking me as a case where Israel and the IDF is really, you know, and

59
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:08,980
proudly putting AI at the front and center of their strategies, their target making.

60
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,860
They've got this, we'll get into it, but there's like a target administrative system or whatever

61
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:25,180
it is that is really focused on creating in a really mass produced way targets for these

62
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,700
like one ton bombs that Israel is dropping on high rise buildings, on universities, on

63
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:40,420
hospitals, on mosque, on open air, you know, flea markets, on schools, wherever they can.

64
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:47,940
They are claiming at least that this AI system that we'll get into is what's spitting out

65
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,380
all of these targets, right, is giving them, as they claim, 100 targets a day, more targets

66
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,820
than they can keep up with with their bombing campaign, giving out of a total database of

67
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:08,380
something like 30 to 40,000 individual targets for Israel to airstrike.

68
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,060
There's obviously a lot here, but we'll get into the details.

69
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,580
There's a lot to discuss around the kind of the politics of this.

70
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,220
There's a lot to discuss around the technology of this as well and what what we should or

71
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,740
should not believe in terms of what IDF spokespeople or the IDF chief of staff is saying

72
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,580
and claiming versus what might be the actual fact.

73
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:40,180
But there is also a lot to be said about how, at the end of the day, there is a really clear,

74
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:49,980
you know, AI, whether it's an AI powered or an AI alibi, right, justified by AI, there

75
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,980
is a really clear kill chain happening here.

76
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,380
There's a really clear kill matrix happening here.

77
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:05,540
You know, as we get into this, I think astute listeners might recall some of the reporting

78
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,900
from 10 years ago, you know, in 2013 around the Obama administration's secret kill

79
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,100
matrix, right, or the disposition matrix, the kill list that they had created.

80
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,220
So crazy. They call it the dispossession matrix.

81
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,940
It's like it's some fucking spin off of the dispossessed from Ursula Le Guin, you know.

82
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Oh, my God.

83
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,260
But, you know, this kill list that the Obama administration created to guide their drone

84
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,460
strikes, right, that and so astute listeners might find some really obvious connections

85
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,420
here from the from 10 years ago with the Obama administration's kill list or or I should

86
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,620
say it's the disposition matrix, but it did dispossess a lot of people of their lives.

87
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,300
That's for sure. And then upgrade.

88
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,020
And then what we're talking about now with this AI system that Israel has is very much

89
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:12,100
a in the direct lineage of the disposition matrix, but is one that, you know, is powered

90
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,380
by machine learning, is taking it to another level, is handing over a lot more decision

91
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,540
making to an automated system, whereas if the kill list, the disposition matrix was

92
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:33,020
a database, this AI system that Israel has is very much at least in the way that the

93
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,420
IDF is talking about it quite explicitly from both current and former soldiers who spoke

94
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,100
to 972 and intelligence officials.

95
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:49,980
They are talking about it as a automated system that that that that title mass assassination

96
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,300
factory is not a bit of a stylistic verve that the magazine came up with.

97
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:05,580
That is a direct quote from an IDF source who called it a mass assassination factory.

98
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,620
Right. And so I think let's get into what this system is, what the underlying strategy,

99
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,060
the military strategy is for this.

100
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,700
But it's it's it's stunning.

101
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,780
It's shocking. And it's even to people like me and Ed, who like our whole job is to not

102
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,820
only know about this stuff, but to like think about it in the most cynical and pessimistic

103
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,140
terms possible.

104
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:39,940
And so it is always a real a real blow when we read stuff that is beyond even our our

105
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,860
imagination of what's actually going on.

106
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,660
You know, this article and we were talking a little bit about this before this article

107
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:55,660
sickening on two accounts, right on the first account, right, is that this makes it this

108
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,060
kind of makes me think about all the death and destruction in a slightly more darker

109
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,740
way and that like, you know, these people are, you know, whether or not, you know, because

110
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,260
we still need reporting done on what the AI, what the actual artificial intelligence is.

111
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,140
But like you like you said off the top, it doesn't really matter whether what the

112
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,860
configuration is. Right. This is one of the risk of AI being promulgated like this, which

113
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,260
is that it sanitizes monstrous crimes because data is neutral.

114
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,540
Right. Because a collation via algorithm is neutral because automation is neutral.

115
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,860
These are not political things.

116
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,580
These are categories that are outside of human cognition.

117
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,980
And as thus we can refer to them, we can embody them, we can reinforce them because

118
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,260
they're not flawed, biased, so on and so forth.

119
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,220
So sickening because it probably also reveals an even like greater pathology about the

120
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,340
children that are being murdered, about the, you know, the young men and women that are

121
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,100
being murdered, about the civilians that are being murdered, right, that in one way or

122
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,220
another, not only is there already the racism, incumbent and Zionism, and especially this

123
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,900
genocide of Palestinians, but then there's also this insistence that might emerge even

124
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,900
from people who might not have that or might take pause with that, that, well, you know,

125
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,700
the mass murder is reciprocal and neutral, you know, because the data is just leading

126
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,980
us in that direction. And then on the second count, also sickening in a way that we'll

127
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,340
talk more about later in the episode, just like, you know, this, this is, this is the

128
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,860
fucking fire this time, you know, and what are people doing?

129
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,380
What are people in the AI ethics and the AI risk and the AI safety community saying

130
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,900
about this, about a system where whether or not AI is actually in a role of it, a military

131
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:03,220
is proudly saying, we named this thing the gospel. It's job, find people to kill. What

132
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:11,780
does it do? Help us kill as many people as possible. Seems like the worst possible scenario

133
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,940
and the perfect one for all of these industries and cottage factories and all these fuckers

134
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:26,660
to speak up and say anything. How many have a handful? If that, right, you can, you can

135
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,420
guess if you're sitting at home, you can probably guess who has said literally anything about

136
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,900
this and deals with those fields. And you'd be almost certainly right on those instances.

137
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,540
I guess who would say this? And you'd be wrong because a lot of those people have not said

138
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,300
anything. That is also true. That's another thing to say that there also are some notable

139
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:58,500
notable signs. Yes. Um, and so it's like, okay, well, what's going on here? You know,

140
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:06,820
because I find it hard to believe it's either they don't know about it or, you know, as

141
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,180
we have talked about, and as other people have talked about, you know, for example,

142
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,060
Khadija over at logic, my editor, you know, has talked about, there's just like a moral

143
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,460
failure in the core framework about how we think about AI ethics and safety and risk

144
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,300
that makes the framework almost useless, right? Like maybe from an outside in perspective,

145
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,460
we can all agree and understand that things should not be developed mindlessly and that

146
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:40,020
there are real consequences to taking data that's constructed in biased means and racist

147
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,460
means from a society that has its own politics and its own social relations and its own economics

148
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,420
and its own history and its own culture, that things will bleed through and, you know,

149
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:57,140
result in the creation of data sets or result in the deployment of weapons and surveillance in

150
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,140
ways that discriminate and hurt certain people. But the industries as they actually are,

151
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:11,220
AI safety, AI risk, AI ethics, they're corporate captured, you know, industries,

152
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,980
and what are, you know, what are, that are doing what? Soaking up all the academic talent

153
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,100
and critical thinkers and critics, hoarding all the resources and the access to the data and to

154
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,580
the computational infrastructure, right? And sucking the air out of any real critique

155
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,740
of how artificial intelligence is talked about, thought about, deployed,

156
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,940
and integrated into things that leaves us within a moment where these motherfuckers are building a

157
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,660
Death Star, you know, like a literal fucking Death Star aimed at civilians in a place that

158
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,420
they occupy and are doing a genocide in, everybody shuts the fuck up. You know, is this, it's useless.

159
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,140
It's useless. I don't, we don't even need, we don't even need, what more do we need to say about it

160
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,580
other than that? If in the moment where there's a literal genocide happening,

161
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:10,100
most of them are silent. It's so fucking frustrating. And it's even more frustrating

162
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,740
when you read the piece, right? Because the piece makes it very clear, whatever the system is,

163
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,820
it has massively expanded the capabilities, right? Where in previous operations,

164
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,100
they were happy to get maybe 100 targets a year. And now they're generating as many targets as

165
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,860
they did in a year inside of a day because what they're doing or what they claim to be doing with

166
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:42,900
this AI system is that they will take, hey, this is, this is the address of a spokesperson for Hamas.

167
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,580
Hey, this is a militant that we know is in this group. Hey, this is like, you know, someone who

168
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,820
was spotted at some sort of demonstration or resistance. This is someone we arrested or picked

169
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:59,220
up and saying, okay, this is where they live. This is where they work. Are these places affiliated

170
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,860
with Hamas? Probably not. But because this person lives there or works there or has been there,

171
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,460
we can blow that shit to shit, blow it to shit. You know, there's just one really striking

172
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:25,140
paragraph. I think it's pretty demonstrative both of the danger in this AI system existing

173
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,980
and then also in the fact that we can say that and not get caught up on how much of it is AI or not

174
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:38,180
because at the end of the day, it's a digital system or piece of technology that's being used

175
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,140
by people who are already looking for a certain problem to be served in a certain way.

176
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:50,180
Solved in a certain way and they have the solution in the way that they deploy it. So we have,

177
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:59,780
at one point, this guy says, you know, first I'll step back and kind of explain one of the

178
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:08,340
insights of the report. In case you might not have known, you know, and as 972 and local call kind

179
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:16,660
of talk about, there are four categories and targets that are struck by Israeli aircraft.

180
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,660
The first are tactical targets, right? And so, you know, these are supposed to be standard military

181
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,380
targets. These are arm cells. These are places where weapons are being held. These are actual

182
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,260
weapons themselves, rocket launchers, anti-tank missile launchers, launch pits, mortar bombs,

183
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,380
military headquarters, observation posts, and so on. The second are hardened underground targets,

184
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:45,220
the tunnels that Hamas uses as well as the tunnels that span through Gaza and underneath

185
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:51,860
Gaza's neighborhoods that are part of the network that brings in goods since Israel's

186
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:59,780
maintaining a blockade. Then, you know, strikes of these targets are not as clear as the first one

187
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,940
because a lot of these tunnels are under civilians, right? They're homes. They're actual

188
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:13,380
infrastructure, the centers of their life, universities, hospitals. You know, you strike

189
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,700
that, you're going to kill a massive amount of people, right? Not that that's going to stop them.

190
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,820
The third are power targets, as they call them, and these are high rises, residential towers,

191
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,900
public buildings, right? These are things that where you hit them, you're hitting not just a place,

192
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,020
you know, not just a neighborhood, not just a place where people work, but like a center

193
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,740
of a section of the life, of the rhythm of a city, of a community, right? You're killing the

194
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,340
university, you're killing the banks, you're killing the government offices, you're killing

195
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,500
hospitals, you're killing office buildings and commercial areas. You're crippling the city,

196
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,460
essentially, right? And you're crippling the ability of people to do anything other than

197
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,020
cower in their homes, which you're going to bomb anyway, right? And the idea here,

198
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:10,500
as self-admitted by the Israeli intelligence sources, is that if we hit these power targets,

199
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:19,700
we place pressure on Hamas, that Palestinian society will reject Hamas. Sidebar, war crime.

200
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:32,740
You know, you can't bomb civilians collectively punishing them for something that groups,

201
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,060
in this case, Hamas is done, right? Not that that matters, but that will come back to be relevant

202
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,180
later. And then the final category are family homes or operatives homes, right? And so these

203
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:51,220
are homes where, these are targets where you suspect one person in that residence is in Hamas

204
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:58,180
or the Islamic Jihad, right? And you bomb it so that you might be able to get that one person,

205
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,100
even though as other, and as we'll talk about other reporting reveals, a lot of the times,

206
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,140
the houses that people say are, you know, that houses that the IDF says we're holding, one

207
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,740
militant or one operative of the Islamic Jihad actually didn't. And in fact, they just killed

208
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,380
huge amount of civilians, right? And so 972 writes that, you know,

209
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:26,900
the Israeli army had really been focusing on the third and fourth categories this time

210
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:35,700
in response to October 7th, in response to Hamas' operation on October 7th. And that,

211
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,820
they write, according to statements on October 11th by the IDF spokesperson,

212
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,660
during the first five days of fighting, half the targets bombed, 1,329 out of a total 2,687

213
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,700
were deemed power targets. And so here's the quote. One source said, we are asked to look

214
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,180
for high rise buildings with half a floor that can be attributed to Hamas. Sometimes it is a

215
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,580
militant group spokesperson office or a point where operatives meet. I understood that the

216
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,780
floor is an excuse that allows the army to cause a lot of destruction in Gaza. This is what they

217
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,620
told us. If they would tell the whole world that the Islamic Jihad offices on the 10th floor are

218
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,940
not important as a target, but that its existence is a justification to bring down the entire high

219
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,700
rise with the aim of pressuring civilian families who live in it in order to put pressure on terrorist

220
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,940
organizations, this would itself be seen as terrorism. So they do not say it. Yeah,

221
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:43,060
because that's terrorism. That is literally the textbook definition of terrorism. When we went

222
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:52,500
into the fucking Middle East and the phase of the invasions premised on the idea that we have

223
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,660
evidence. This is when we were still trying to figure out what the war aims were going to be.

224
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,740
We have evidence that Osama bin Laden was responsible for 9-11. Give him over to us

225
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,780
in senior leadership who's involved in planning it and we won't invade. Okay. Do you have evidence?

226
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,860
Yeah. Will you give us the evidence? No. Okay. Then we're not going to hand him over. It was

227
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:24,100
more or less the exchange in the early years. So we invaded. There are very clear guidelines

228
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,980
in international law on what you're supposed to do. You don't have to follow them when you

229
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,860
have the largest military in the world. An insistence to follow them is deemed as

230
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:45,860
unpatriotic, naive, simple-minded, apologism for terrorism when in reality it's to present

231
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:54,020
situations like this, where you have Israel bombing, flying anything that moves on anything

232
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:02,100
that moves so that they can do what? Clear out Gaza as part of what is the very transparent

233
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,660
genocide of Palestinians so that they can come in and eventually settle the northern and the

234
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:14,740
southern strips of Gaza. So what I was saying earlier about whether or not the role of AI here

235
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,220
as it gets fleshed out in future reporting, we see here the thing that we've talked about as an

236
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:31,060
actual risk of artificial intelligence. There's a problem. Israel wants justification for killing

237
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:37,780
as many civilians as possible for clearing out buildings in Gaza, for terrorizing Palestinian

238
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:44,420
society. Solution, argue that the reason you're doing the thing that you've been planning on

239
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:51,300
doing that you have actually been doing for the past few decades is because of a new technology

240
00:24:51,300 --> 00:25:00,660
that allows you to collate disparate threads of intelligence and pinpoint with computational

241
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:10,820
sanitation or cleanliness exactly what parts of Palestinian society you need to press on to make

242
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:17,540
Hamas screen because that's really what it comes down to. Whether or not

243
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,620
AI, there's an actual real automated system here or it's a bunch of people who still have to review

244
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,900
the system and are still doing the final say on everything or it's a bunch of people just signing

245
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,900
off. Whatever it is, it's very clear what's happening here, which is one of the things

246
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,980
we should be concerned about as an AI risk, which is that people are going to use it to justify some

247
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,940
incredibly immoral thing that they're eager to do by saying that, well, the computer is just turning

248
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,860
out the numbers. I'm just in the Chinese box. I'm just following orders. I'm just translating

249
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,660
reality based on what this thing is finding out there. And that, again, it's just like it's

250
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,340
so insane. This is like one of the earliest parts of the article, right? This is one of the earliest

251
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:12,340
and such unambiguous war crime material, AI risk material things, silence, silence from that sector.

252
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:22,500
Yeah, the silence is deafening. Really, truly, the silence is deafening. And you're exactly

253
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,260
right here. When we get into, and we will very shortly, more into Habsora, which is the name

254
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:38,020
of this system. And as you said, that translates to English from Hebrew as the gospel, which,

255
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,500
talk about the direct link to the episode we just released as well.

256
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,180
Yeah, about making God.

257
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:57,460
About making God, using AI to make God, and using AI to justify the techno fascism through

258
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:08,100
religiosity. You name your mass assassination factory, the gospel, as if it is the voice of

259
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:19,620
God telling you where to drop tens of thousands of tons of bombs on all these

260
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:26,180
quote unquote power targets. It's so unambiguous here. It's so unambiguous. And like you said,

261
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:34,580
it doesn't matter if it's truly some AI automated system. Even though, I mean,

262
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,860
it is telling, and we'll get to this later as well, that IDF people are explicitly saying

263
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:48,020
that they don't have the ability to closely review all of the outputs from the system

264
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:55,220
because there are just so many, but their whole mandate is quantity. The more targets, the better.

265
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,460
And so they are explicitly, which is a total reversal of everybody else who is always talking

266
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:09,460
about how, no, no, no, we have careful human review of the outputs from automated systems.

267
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,500
And here the IDF is being like, we don't have time to do all that human review of this shit.

268
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,780
We got bombs to drop.

269
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,900
There was some guy who was just talking the other day on Twitter about how artificial

270
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,660
intelligence is like the printing press, and that it's an inherent good, and everybody is

271
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:33,620
made more intelligent by the proliferation of AI products, goods, and services.

272
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:39,380
And when you mentioned and talk about that quantity over quality element,

273
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,580
in some ways it is like the printing press. And in this specific scenario,

274
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,700
getting flooded with junk, with bullshit, with bad data. I don't even want to call it bad data

275
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,140
because that suggests there's good data that the IDF could use. But getting flooded with

276
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,100
information and then using that to just be like, well, we are going to kill them all anyway.

277
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:15,300
So now at least we have nicely tabulated formal categories and zones of attack and targets

278
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,940
versus having to ad hoc justify why we did a war crime again.

279
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:27,060
Yeah. And talk about the links to the Obama kill list as well.

280
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,940
The IDF is explicitly saying, they explicitly said, we are not being surgical.

281
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,140
They are just loving to say the loud part, the quiet part loud right now on all of this.

282
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,180
But that is also, I think, really telling here as well where the disposition matrix

283
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:55,620
and drone warfare was designed to be sanitized through its surgicalness. It was supposed to be

284
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:02,260
precise, surgical. We have a kill list of individual targets. We have drones that are

285
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:10,180
dropping smart missiles on people. It's all surgical. It's all precise. It's sanitized.

286
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:18,740
Here, what we have is an AI system, Haspera, which is cranking out more targets than IDF

287
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:28,340
intelligence can keep up with. Those targets are leading. They are the justification.

288
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:39,380
Ultimately, it doesn't really matter if the AI is leading you to the power targets or the AI is

289
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,620
the justification for bombing power targets you already want to bomb. At the end of the day,

290
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:55,220
it's the same output where the IDF is claiming that the AI is leading them through this network

291
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:03,300
analysis to these targets. And then all they do is if a target is spit out, then they bomb it.

292
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,900
Targets spit out, they bomb it. Targets spit out, they bomb it.

293
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:17,700
It does seem to be a really nice coincidence for the IDF that so many of the targets that are being

294
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:28,660
spit out by Hapsora are targets that their military strategy is focused on. As you said

295
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:36,740
from the 972 reporting power targets, so the high-rise buildings, the universities,

296
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:44,900
the hospitals, the infrastructure. It's not even shock and awe. It's shock and massacre

297
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,300
because also the fourth target that you mentioned is the family home.

298
00:31:49,300 --> 00:32:00,260
So Hapsora is pointing them to power targets and family homes. It explains why if you are

299
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,540
paying attention to what's happening in Gaza, the reporting is constantly talking about,

300
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:14,100
well, Gaza has no more universities. Gaza has no more hospitals. Oh, here's yet another person

301
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:23,220
who has had more than 30 of their family members killed by Israel. The reporting here as well

302
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:32,420
around some of those numbers are mind-boggling. It really puts a material human cost on these

303
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:41,460
systems and strategies. For the IDF for Israel, the technological system and the military strategy

304
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:48,340
are intimately linked together. They are not able to be disentangled. They are serving each other.

305
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:57,540
It's not a unidirectional causal flow where the technology leads to the strategy or the strategy

306
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:03,220
leads. It's bidirectional. It's a relationship. They are mutually reinforcing each other.

307
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:13,620
We can see this in the material human cost that is being reported. We're recording this. It's

308
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,260
December 6. I'll just put a time date on it because this is all moving so fast.

309
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:30,260
This is two months after October 7, after everything started. The report that we're seeing

310
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:41,460
and that 972 reports on some of the death toll numbers even just from a month into the war,

311
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:48,420
the massacre, the genocide. There's numbers from November 11 talking about that even by that time,

312
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:57,220
even a month into it, there were over 300 people who had more than 10 family members killed.

313
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:07,700
Then there were hundreds of people who had seven to nine family members killed,

314
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:17,060
hundreds more that had five family members. The death tolls here are only able to be

315
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:24,020
comprehended, I think, as incomprehensible as they are by understanding it as an outcome of

316
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:33,780
the bombing power targets in family homes. It is a military strategy bolstered by, powered by,

317
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:41,780
justified by, sanitized by a technological system that is designed to not just cause

318
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:50,500
mass destruction but wipe out entire family lineages. This is ethnic cleansing.

319
00:34:50,580 --> 00:35:01,620
This is Nakba. We have to understand that sanitizing nature of the technology is also

320
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:10,340
a cleansing. It's an ethnic cleansing that we see here. A cleansing by wiping away whole lineages

321
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,340
of families, of Palestinian families. You can even hear it when they talk about,

322
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,820
you know, for example, they talk about bombing entire neighborhoods. Like you said,

323
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,900
how they're not surgical. When pressed about it, they're just like, well, you know,

324
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,340
and they've always been, and IDF has always been consistent on this. Neighborhoods are

325
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:40,500
just tamas recruiting grounds. They're terror nests. They're operational headquarters.

326
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,100
Civilians are operational assets. Residents inside of these buildings are assets that might

327
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,740
be used by the terrorist buildings. Like no one's a person. Everyone's a potential terrorist

328
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:59,220
or a subhuman that's waiting to be purged. And now we have this technological implementation

329
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:05,300
that just so happens to agree with us, right? Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, I want to get

330
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:13,700
into the technology a bit more too. But before, you know, I'll do that right now. But before I do,

331
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,860
you know, I mentioned the kill, the Obama kill list. The way this technology works and the way

332
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:28,100
it's being used also really strikes me as being extremely similar to Palantir, right? The network

333
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:36,980
analysis that Palantir has created, which was as we should always remember and always mention,

334
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:45,300
you know, Palantir was created with funding from the, in QTEL, the CIA's venture capital

335
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,660
arm. And it was created originally, despite its widespread use now in public health,

336
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:59,540
in finance and policing and mineral extraction, you know, despite all of that,

337
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:07,860
it was originally created for the war on terror. It was created as a tool for the CIA. It was

338
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:14,340
created as a tool for the Pentagon. It was created to do this kind of network analysis,

339
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:21,380
as they call it, to find terror cells, right? And how do they do that? Well, the whole idea

340
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:28,740
is that they were going to create networks of associations with people, right? You create a

341
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:36,500
network of all of the people associated with somebody, all of the addresses associated with

342
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:44,820
them, the locations, the vehicles, everything that you possibly can, every object or relationship

343
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,420
that you can associate with somebody, you map that into this big, giant network. And the idea

344
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,180
is that through that, you are able to map these terror cells, right? You're able to see how,

345
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:05,300
oh, these people have a vehicle in common with each other. We've got data that at independent

346
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:14,500
times, these three people have used this same vehicle. Okay, maybe that's an Al-Qaeda vehicle.

347
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:22,500
That was the whole idea of Palantir, is to create this network analysis, specifically to map out

348
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:29,220
these terror cells, to map out their associations with addresses, with vehicles, with families,

349
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:38,580
with friends, with whoever, with whatever, with wherever, and then as a way to then create targets

350
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:49,860
to do an enhanced interrogation of, to assassinate, right? Whatever it is that you're doing,

351
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:58,500
all of the terrible things, that is also, it sounds to me like the way Hapsara works is very,

352
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:06,660
very similar to that kind of network analysis, right? I think it's also important to keep in

353
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:15,700
mind all of these technological lineages that we see here, that as absolutely fucking terrifying,

354
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:24,740
horrendous and shocking as this is, it is also not unprecedented. It is very much in a, which

355
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:34,420
means it's not unpredictable either, or unpredicted. It is in a long precedent and lineage of how these

356
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,900
technologies are designed, how they're created, and what they are used for.

357
00:39:38,900 --> 00:40:05,700
So, let's talk a little bit about 972's reporting on Hapsara so that we can understand as well.

358
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:12,660
We talked about the military strategy here of focusing on power targets and family homes.

359
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,780
Let's talk about the technological system that is powering that and justifying that, right?

360
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,980
I'm actually just going to quote some from 972 because I think they really clearly

361
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,940
lay it out and I don't want to mince their careful wording here.

362
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:34,100
According to intelligence sources, Hapsara, which, as a side note, remember, this translates as

363
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:41,300
the gospel. So, always keep that in mind too. According to intelligence sources, Hapsara generates,

364
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:48,100
among other things, automatic recommendations for attacking private residences where people suspected

365
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:55,220
of being Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives live. Israel then carries out large-scale assassination

366
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:01,700
operations through the heavy shelling of these residential homes.

367
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:07,860
Side note as well, this is not our common imagination of assassination.

368
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:18,660
We now think of assassination as Assassin's Creed or as Hitman or as Navy SEALs or James Bond.

369
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:27,860
As this thing that happens in secret and with surgical precision, no. For Israel, assassination

370
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:35,700
means heavy shelling of residential homes. It is literally shooting a passenger plane out of the

371
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,740
sky not because there's a Hamas operative on the plane, but because a Hamas operative once sat on

372
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:55,140
a seat in the plane. That is what's happening here. Hapsara, as one of the sources explained,

373
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:01,220
processes enormous amounts of data that, quote, tens of thousands of intelligence officers could

374
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:08,660
not process and recommends bombing sites in real time because most senior Hamas officials head into

375
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,940
underground tunnels with the start of any military operation, the sources say. The use

376
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,340
of a system like Hapsara makes it possible to locate and attack the homes of relatively junior

377
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:26,580
operatives. One former intelligence officer explained that the Hapsara system enables the

378
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:34,180
army to run a, quote, unquote, mass assassination factory in which the, quote, emphasis is on

379
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:40,420
quantity and not on quality. A human eye will go over the targets before each attack,

380
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,380
but it need not spend a lot of time on them, said the former intelligence officer.

381
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:52,580
Since Israel estimates that there are approximately 30,000 Hamas members in Gaza and they are all

382
00:42:52,580 --> 00:43:00,180
marked for death, the number of potential targets is enormous. In 2019, the Israeli

383
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,700
army created a new center aimed at using AI to accelerate target generation. As the former IDF

384
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:13,380
chief of staff said in an in-depth interview with YNET earlier this year, quote, the target's

385
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:19,940
administrative division is a unit that includes hundreds of officers and soldiers and is based on

386
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:27,060
AI capabilities. The IDF chief of staff went on to say, quote, this is a machine that with the help

387
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:34,180
of AI processes a lot of data better and faster than any human and translates it into targets

388
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:40,660
for attack. The result was that in Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021, from the moment

389
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:46,660
this machine was activated, it generated 100 new targets every day. You see, in the past,

390
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,260
there was times in Gaza when we would create 50 targets per year, and here the machine produced

391
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:59,460
100 targets in one day. We prepare the targets automatically and work according to a checklist,

392
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,780
one of the sources who worked in the new targets administrative division told 972 and Local Call.

393
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,700
Quote, it really is like a factory. We work quickly and there is no time to delve deep into

394
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,220
the target. The view is that we are judged according to how many targets we manage to generate.

395
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:25,220
So, I mean, that's Hapsara in a nutshell. That's the gospel in a nutshell. It is about

396
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:33,220
maximizing. Calling it a mass assassination factory is actually the most apt description you have

397
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:41,060
because it is truly about mass production. It is Fordism for genocide, right? It is about maximizing

398
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:48,980
the quantity of target generation and then responding to those targets in an automated way

399
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,380
of, you know, as I said before, target generated, bomb dropped, target generated, bomb dropped,

400
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:02,020
and you just, and the whole job is to keep up with the factory line, spitting out targets,

401
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:10,260
no review, no oversight for quality, no concerns about the morality or legality of it, right?

402
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:16,500
But instead, the AI provides justification. You know, the AI is giving you targets of

403
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,900
her mass operatives. It's not our fault that they use human shields, whether it be

404
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:30,500
their own families or hospitals or schools or mosque, you know, it's not our fault,

405
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:36,340
but we got to kill the Hamas operative, you know, and so if we have to, you know, hey,

406
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:42,020
we're not the one holding the human shield, right? But we are blowing it apart. I mean,

407
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,940
this is what's happening here, right? I think, you know, to go back as well to some of the real,

408
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:57,620
the deafening silence of the fact that people are, like, why are the people that we follow,

409
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:04,580
the people that are in our networks, the people we know, who are, like, always, who are so concerned

410
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:11,140
about the ethics and politics and impacts of AI, why is this not the thing everyone is screaming

411
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,020
their head off about right now? Or at least linking to the article, right? I've not even seen

412
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:23,860
people link to the article, you know, like, why? It doesn't make sense to me, especially when,

413
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:32,420
you know, if you consider how much attention it receives, how loudly people crow

414
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:39,940
when, and rightfully so, whenever there's a similar kind of automated system that is

415
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:48,420
targeting people for welfare fraud, right? And like, as we've seen, as we see in recent reporting

416
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,420
in France, as we talked about with the Dutch algorithm, as we've talked about with Australia,

417
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,420
as we talked about in the US, right? Like, as we've talked about in the UK, right? These systems

418
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,340
exist all over the place, right? These AI systems or automated systems that target people

419
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:14,020
with risk scores, label them as welfare frauds, and then deny them their welfare benefits,

420
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:22,340
trap them in these labyrinthine bureaucratic systems, deprive them of the resources and aid

421
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,820
that they not only need, but are due, right? That they deserve. Anytime that happens,

422
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:36,420
there is so much attention to it, right? There is so much writing about it, you know,

423
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,020
yelling about it, and rightfully so. It's truly awful. And yet, when we see a system that is

424
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,700
doing much the same, but not to deprive you of welfare benefits, but to deprive you of your life,

425
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:54,100
to deprive you of your entire family, to deprive you of your communities, to deprive you of your

426
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:00,420
land, to deprive you of everything that you have, and everything that you will ever have.

427
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:08,020
When we see a system doing that, people just are suddenly clamped up, you know? Are they too

428
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:17,220
shocked to talk? Why is it that it seems to be more morally reprehensible to deprive a Palestinian

429
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,780
of their welfare benefits than it is to deprive them of their life and their whole family? Why?

430
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:33,300
I don't understand. Have we reached the limits of politics where it is so horrendous that we

431
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:39,540
can't even speak of it? Have we reached the limits of morality and legality where actually,

432
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,980
this is justified, that the people deserve it, that, hey, I can see both sides of the issue,

433
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:52,660
and it's a land of contrast? None of that holds water for me. I don't understand.

434
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,580
I mean, it's cowardice, right? I mean, it's cowardice. Khadijah wrote a long time about

435
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:08,180
this in an article that I think got a lot of people to pay attention to. It was called

436
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,660
on the moral collapse of AI ethics, right? And it was talking about how a lot of people are

437
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:22,100
focusing on the firing of Timnit Gebru and the firing shows that Google is fucked, right? But

438
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:29,060
there are also other questions and debates and discussions we should have, like the fact that AI

439
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,540
ethics is a fundamentally limited thing, especially if we're talking about AI ethics in Google.

440
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:40,820
We've already lost the plot if we think that a firing at Google is the problem, because the

441
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:52,180
problem is even larger than the fact that Google has a specific engagement with the AI ethics

442
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:58,500
community, right? It scales up to the fact that even our ideas about what AI ethics looks like

443
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,900
are just nonsense, right? Because they don't begin with a fundamentally antagonistic relationship

444
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:13,140
or engagement towards how capitalism and specifically racial capitalism has created

445
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:19,940
and spurred along the development of deeply discriminatory and exploitative and extractive

446
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:25,220
technologies. We talk about it all the time. Most of the technology we have in this world

447
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:31,780
that people crow about is just an exotic way to surveil on another person or to kill another

448
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:37,300
person. That's most of the shit. That's most of the shit that everyone is excited about all the

449
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,580
fucking time, right? And so when we are over here talking about AI ethics, a lot of the time it's

450
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:46,420
like, well, how do we make a more humane way of killing other human beings? Or how do we make a

451
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,980
more humane way of surveilling other people, right? Fundamentally. And to lose sight of that is to have

452
00:50:52,980 --> 00:51:00,660
lost the plot. And most people in that field or industry in one way or another have lost the plot,

453
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,700
which is not to say there are a lot of people I know and respect who are in these fields,

454
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,620
right? But the ones whose work I really love and look to and read and think about are also grappling

455
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:16,820
with the fact that there are fundamental limits here, right? And that the real problem is how do

456
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,260
we get out of it? What's the off ramp? How do you get out of this stupid fucking discussion?

457
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:29,060
Well, the question is, do we do a one-year moratorium on Apple's facial recognition software

458
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:34,260
inside of its ring surveillance cameras that it gives to police departments for free or a two-year

459
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:42,580
moratorium instead of why the fuck is a delivery company giving surveillance cameras to police

460
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:51,460
departments and giving them facial recognition software when it's misidentifying black and

461
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,700
brown people at a ridiculous rate? Why is that? What's going on there? Well,

462
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:04,660
good luck really having a great discussion with that. And even, as Skedija points out,

463
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,420
even the engagement that we do get with that in the form of surveillance capitalism

464
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:18,420
falls short. The idea of surveillance as a service is still fundamentally blunted once

465
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,660
she writes that the larger point is even our language is failing us because we're too often

466
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,220
fighting to save a democracy that modernity has foreclosed. We need a radical reframing away from

467
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:33,540
the lone researcher against Goliath to reckon with the failures of fairness, accountability,

468
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:38,820
transparency, and broader ethics frameworks that have allowed opportunists to build their brand,

469
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:44,100
taking up space required to address the core issues of big tax hegemonic violence as described

470
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:53,860
in Timnit's paper. I'll also quote at length because I think that I really encourage you to

471
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,940
check out the writings from a few years ago, but it's still poignant. I think about it,

472
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,500
think about it especially with this piece. She writes, if you were shocked by the firing

473
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,900
of Timnit, you haven't been paying attention. We need to fucking take responsibility for the

474
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,780
present because while you're immobilized, debating whether if you're the one who should mention the

475
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,380
corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion lexicon inherently decoupled from political

476
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:25,140
economic analysis is half the problem. The most opportunist and or mediocre are defining the

477
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:30,980
discourse on a global stage. We're ruminating about Jeff Deans' feelings instead of building

478
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:38,180
a cross-class labor movement that defines tech workers broadly, i.e. researchers, engineers,

479
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:43,300
Uber drivers, Amazon warehouse workers, content moderators, etc. We should cry out,

480
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:48,100
not because Timnit is a brilliant scientist who shaped her field, but because her firing

481
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:53,700
is a symptom of a broken society we've constructed. She isn't fucked, we're all fucked.

482
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,780
The academics and computer scientists claiming they will no longer volunteer their free labor

483
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,900
when it comes time to reviewing Google academic submissions should be commended. Whoever they

484
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,780
should ask themselves, what is it about the high-minded ideals of unimpeded academic freedom

485
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,900
that were so divorced from the praxis that research was enabling? Saying that phrenology

486
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:19,140
was conducted rigorously is insufficient. That issue isn't Google or language models or Jeff

487
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:24,260
Dean, rather it is a field that has sold itself to industries that are killing people. That is the

488
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:33,460
crux of the thing. That's where it comes down home to. Israel is a perfect either representation or

489
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:44,180
mirror in our own tech industry. I'll start with Israel first. As we had Anthony Lowenstein come

490
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,740
on to talk about the Palestine laboratory, one of the indispensable roles that Israel plays

491
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:55,460
in the world is that it battle tests surveillance tech and murder tech on Palestinians and then

492
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,340
exports it to autocratic regimes around the world to suppress minority populations.

493
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:10,580
As the climate begins to get worse on climate refugees, silence on that as well as a refusal

494
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:19,300
to acknowledge that axis of oppression that's going on is a lot of things, but we should also

495
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:26,420
understand fundamentally is moral cowardice. Part of that is also because the same fucking

496
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:35,860
thing happens here. The largest sources of legitimacy in the tech industries and in

497
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:41,060
various fields attached to the tech industry come from how close people are to the money

498
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:50,260
that's being generated from selling yourself to an industry that kills people. How much money

499
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:55,780
are you going to be making if you're helping train these drones or do the network analysis

500
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:01,300
that helps with this targeted assassination or help militarize this or that technology and

501
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:08,260
application in the field? What kind of innovations to surveillance as a service can you offer

502
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:15,220
both in terms of the advertising model and also in terms of also just surveillance as a product

503
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:22,100
that will allow you to tap into other aspects of people's daily lives? We can talk about the

504
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:27,140
surveillance products that Amazon rolls out without dipping into the limited surveillance

505
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:32,260
capitalism thing because we can talk about the fact that, again, the ring cameras.

506
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,260
What is a ring camera? A ring camera is not simply like a little surveillance camera

507
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:44,340
that is offered as a product divorced from reality that you get to buy. A ring camera is a pretty

508
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:50,340
smart move that ends up playing roles intentional and growing to fill unintentional ones with a

509
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:55,540
little nudging. When you have a ring camera, you're part of a process where this company gives them

510
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:01,460
to other people, departments for free, and gins them up in marketing as, look, you live in an

511
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:09,860
unsafe place. You should have surveillance so that you can protect your property, you can protect

512
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:14,980
your packages, you can protect your family, ignoring that, for example, a lot of the people

513
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:19,380
who get them are in places that are already relatively safe and also that a lot of people

514
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:28,260
who use them are using them to surveil packages that, if you lose them, Amazon refunds you

515
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,380
and you can get them, again, no questions asked. You could get the thing, take it into your home,

516
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:38,020
say you never got it, and they give it to you, no questions asked. But besides the point on that,

517
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:43,140
also, you're getting then ingratiated into this network where the idea is we should all be

518
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:50,740
encouraged in one way or another to sign on to these forms of surveillance as they help out

519
00:57:50,740 --> 00:58:01,780
Amazon. Sometimes that means disciplining or surveilling delivery workers who are already

520
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:08,580
overworked and underpaid and over-exploited. But then Amazon has created a Byzantine legal

521
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,340
structure to keep hands distance at, so maybe it doesn't have as much control as it might want,

522
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:19,140
but has more control than it should. Well, the surveillance camera has now allowed people inside

523
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:24,740
of their homes with the Ring cameras to act as another boss that they have to deal with

524
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:29,620
while they're still being kept away from Amazon as not being an actual employee of Amazon.

525
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:37,540
The Ring camera ends up growing and expanding because Ring is going here and saying,

526
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,220
look, Amazon is going here and saying, we have a piece of technology.

527
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,220
And the thing that we're interested in doing is growing it out, one, as surveillance products so

528
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:49,380
that we can fill our other needs inside of the ecosystem, and two, because we're interested in

529
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,900
exploring whether we can plug it into other goods and services, whether we can garner insights from

530
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:00,100
there that will get us into maybe creating more network devices in your home, or maybe in figuring

531
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:05,380
out if we can try to push on to larger and larger groups of people, larger and larger, smaller and

532
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:11,540
more niche products. You see that the technology quickly grows and expands until it becomes

533
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:17,220
an all-consuming, it becomes plugged into part of this ever-consuming expansionary goal.

534
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,700
So we can note all that and then also talk about the racial elements that come with racial capitalism

535
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,940
and talk about how a lot of the times the surveillance technology is used to raise its

536
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,100
ends, it's biased against black and brown faces, and even if you correct the bias,

537
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,420
it's still going to be used by institutions, by the police departments, as an example,

538
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,300
by welfare agencies, as we've talked about in previous episodes, to discriminate against

539
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,340
people. Because in the real world, even outside of the corrected data, if you made it neutral

540
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:53,620
somehow, you still have a racist politics at the end of the day. The idea that you can just create

541
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:59,940
a piece of tech and debate about the rules that are inscribed on it inside of this narrow

542
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:05,300
application, ignoring the actual society in which it's being deployed in and the people who are

543
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,620
deploying it is stupid. And it's also cowardice and it's coming usually from people who are

544
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,340
compensated well enough to ignore that, as it is in the United States, as it is in Israel.

545
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,460
Because if you were in Israel and someone was like, oh, what's going on with all the things

546
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:28,900
that we're testing out on Palestinians? We would find it a little stupid if people were debating

547
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:34,980
about how high the apartheid border fences should be, or what kind of cameras should be put on them,

548
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:43,620
or whether the camera should have algorithmic facial recognition services or not, or what types

549
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:51,380
of labor regimes settlers should be subjecting Palestinians to, what type of schedules of work

550
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:56,260
they should be subjected to. All of this would be considered quibbling and over a fundamentally

551
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:02,980
immoral thing. And yet, or I would hope so, because some people don't actually even think

552
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,060
that there's anything wrong going on with the apartheid system. But nonetheless,

553
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,940
when we look here and then when some people look out there, they don't see anything wrong.

554
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:18,580
There's nothing wrong to them. And whenever you come across that as a case, it's usually because

555
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:24,020
of moral cowardice. It's because people who really think that when we say the word AI ethics, AI safety,

556
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:29,860
AI risk, in their heads, they're talking about the sci-fi shit. They're talking about God going

557
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:34,580
in a mech and killing everybody. They're talking about Skynet. They're not talking about here and

558
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,660
now where there's a fucking genocide going on, or where there's an apartheid going on, where there's

559
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:50,900
a welfare system going on. And it's a bit insane. It's a bit insane. It speaks to such a deep

560
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:58,580
moral collapse and rot that the nicest thing you can say about such an industry is that it's useless.

561
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:09,940
Because how do you have that much access to capital? You're soaked by that many corporations.

562
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:18,020
You're isolated and given enough access to academic resources and time and space to develop

563
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,860
them intellectually or synthesize them into some framework. And the best that we come up with

564
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:32,260
a lot of the times from these ethics, safety, and risks people is checking the boxes on diversity.

565
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:41,380
I don't know. It's just a fundamental failure. It's disgusting.

566
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:49,220
It is. And I think Khadijah is also dead on here as well, where she says in her essay,

567
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:55,460
if the room taken up with building individual brands lends itself to researching with those

568
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:01,300
most impacted, developing tactical initiatives like a social justice war room, we'd be in a

569
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:06,020
very different place. I think that's also a big part of it too. A lot of this is, unfortunately,

570
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:14,900
about building up your brand as the more ethical person in the room. It's not to say that people

571
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:21,780
don't care about this stuff. I'm not saying that. I don't think people are cynical and they don't

572
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:29,220
actually care beyond seeing it as an opportunity to build a brand. But we are reaching some limits

573
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:35,300
here where people have decided the trade off of speaking versus not speaking.

574
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:49,380
I can't take that trade off because it might irreparably damage my brand. It might damage

575
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,580
my ability to do more good in the future. We've got to think effectively about these altruistic

576
01:03:54,580 --> 01:04:01,060
actions. What's the most good I can do as an activist in the future?

577
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:12,740
It's cowardice. It's a cowardice. I think it is also based in an ironic fetishism of the technology

578
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:21,700
itself. We might bang on about those people who fetishize the technology because they think it's

579
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:28,020
going to make God. It is God. It's going to end the world. It's going to bring utopia. They

580
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:34,660
fetishize the technology and say, tis, tis, tis. Don't fetishize the technology. At the end of the

581
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:43,540
day as well, they fetishize the technology. They're concerned about the ethics or morality

582
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:50,900
or politics or responsibility of AI. Hey, we've got to make it ethical. We've got to make the

583
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:59,700
technology responsible. Our whole analysis forever has always been a materialist one,

584
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:08,100
which is focused on not the technology itself but the systems that the technology emerges out of,

585
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:15,300
plugs into, plays a role in. We talk about the technology because we want to talk about

586
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:20,740
capital. We talk about the technology because we want to talk about fascism. We talk about

587
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:24,740
the technology because we want to talk about genocide. Those are the things we're actually

588
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:32,500
talking about. We're talking about the ways that the technology gets enrolled into perpetuating,

589
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:39,540
intensifying, justifying, covering up those other things that actually matter in the world.

590
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:47,860
I guess when the genocide is too out in your face, it's hard to talk about the AI.

591
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,220
Mm-hmm.

592
01:05:50,260 --> 01:06:03,140
It's too much for me. This story, it hits so close to us as well because it is talking about

593
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,700
how these systems are being used. Ultimately, it doesn't matter, as we've talked about,

594
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:13,860
if the AI system is actually being used as an artificial intelligence to automate this,

595
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:26,020
or if it's being used as a movie prop to justify actions that the IDF already wants to take. It

596
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:31,540
doesn't matter because the material consequences at the end of the day are the same. Part of those

597
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:38,820
material consequences are getting a lot of people to not talk about it, to not pay attention to it.

598
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:45,780
It's not just justifying the action. It's not just directing the action. It is also getting a

599
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:53,620
lot of people to not pay attention to the action as well in whatever reason. If anything, a story

600
01:06:53,620 --> 01:07:00,580
like this about Hapsara, about the gospel, if anything, this should be a clarion call for all

601
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:09,220
those people who are like, hey, Israel-Palestine conflict, that's not my job description. I study

602
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:17,620
technology. Well, here you go. Here's a technology to pay attention to. It should be bringing people

603
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:24,980
into the fold to be like, okay, fuck, all right, I study technology. Okay, I got to pay attention.

604
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,340
This matters, but it's done the opposite.

605
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:35,300
There's this line he has. It's in his The Taming of Tech Criticism piece, which every year

606
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:44,980
that passes by, his really condemnation and disgust in a very dry, Laconian way that reminds me of

607
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:54,100
Chomsky's own disgust with public intellectuals feels more and more right when he says that

608
01:07:54,100 --> 01:08:00,500
disconnected from actual political struggles and social criticism, technology criticism is

609
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:08,660
just an elaborate but affirmative footnote to the status quo. In more than one way,

610
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:14,660
I think that has been the case, right? Because one of the things that I think has dominated,

611
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:20,340
and it's hard to even figure out, well, it's not hard. I mean, it's easy to talk about,

612
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,820
but it's also like, I think conservatives and right-wingers are pretty cynical in which it's

613
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:29,700
easy when you start talking about DEI, for example, and the ways in which a lot of people

614
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:37,780
have kind of slotted that or assumed that to be a social criticism. When in reality, it doesn't

615
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:46,100
matter what color the other faces at the table are at the end of the day, right? If the fundamental

616
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,140
system, well, take whoever's at the table and plug them into a system that still exploits

617
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:57,060
everyone else who looks a certain way outside of the table, right? You can have an AI ethics,

618
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:04,340
this call for, for example, for the OpenAI board to be half men and half women, to have POC on it.

619
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:10,100
What the fuck will that, what would that actually do though if we were being tech critics about

620
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,500
what OpenAI's designs and plans for artificial intelligence are, right?

621
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:23,620
What would that do to change Sam Altman's attempt to create a firm that has AI hardware

622
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:27,780
that every firm has to then rely on if they're interested in developing software?

623
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:33,620
And similarly, what would that mean or do for criticisms of Israel's apartheid state and

624
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:40,580
genocide? I mean, they let everyone serve in their military. Does that change the degree to which

625
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:50,180
they do war crimes? No. Would the AI ethics lens and focusing on this sort of diversity and inclusion

626
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:56,020
have any real possibility of impact? Would Elbit Systems be more humane in the weapons that it uses

627
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:02,340
against Palestinians if it had some Palestinians on the board? These seem a bit silly and maybe

628
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:07,700
unfair examples to use, but that is one of the places or one of the only places you end up going

629
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:13,860
for example, focusing on that DI element, right? If you expand it a little bit more broadly and

630
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:20,420
quibble about what's going on, as you said, a lot of people insist, well, it's a complicated issue,

631
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,260
that's political. I'm not really concerned about that. I'm just concerned about making sure there's

632
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:30,260
some sort of equity and outcome, right? But how are you going to achieve that if there's not an

633
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,900
actual political vision and struggle? I mean, part of the reason why Silicon Valley has been

634
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:40,420
so ascendant is because nobody seems to have another fucking vision, right? For what to

635
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:45,140
actually do with technology in our daily lives and how to integrate and organize our societies

636
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:50,340
around it or not around it, right? Where should technology be plugged in and where should it

637
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:55,300
shouldn't be? What types of weapons, what types of artificial intelligences, what types of systems

638
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,700
are we going to put a hard lock on and what types of systems will we ensure that other people can't

639
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,860
bypass when we have that hard lock on? What types of capital flows are we going to prohibit? What

640
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:08,740
types of business activity are we going to prohibit, right? None of these things really

641
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:17,380
bubble up, except in, of course, relatively radical segments, largely academics, right?

642
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:21,700
And activists who are able to articulate these visions, but will have them ignored by the

643
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:26,740
mainstream, right? Which is largely concerned with just build it perpetually until there's a

644
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,940
problem. And then when there's a problem, let the people who caused the problem write the rules

645
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:37,460
about how the problem should be handled, you know? And I worry, my greatest fucking worry with this

646
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:45,540
is that one, either people in that industry will see it in shrug, right? Or we'll use it

647
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,260
to do the brand building, right? That Khadija kind of talked about where they say, whoa, whoa,

648
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:56,820
you know, this is horrible. Not much we can do about it, but, you know, if we listen to my 10

649
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:01,780
steps, then we'd be able to prevent that happening in the United States. When the thing is,

650
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:09,300
you know, it's happening somewhere right now, you know? What, if anything, can we do about that?

651
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:16,100
I will not, I'm not going to pretend like I would even begin to really know, but the people who do

652
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:21,060
insist they know, and who pretend to know, and who create their whole identities and brands around

653
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:27,380
this have been silent and left us without anything. Yeah. And it is always that,

654
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:32,500
the exact what you just said there as well of like, you know, if we do these 10 steps,

655
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:39,220
then we can prevent this happening in the U.S., right? Like there is, so often there is this,

656
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:45,460
like, whether it's explicitly or it's just kind of beneath the surface, there is this kind of idea of

657
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:52,420
like, man, it'd be wild if that happened to us, you know? Like, I'm glad I can do some remote

658
01:12:52,420 --> 01:13:00,820
criticism here. You know, I can take up my telescope and look abroad into exotic places

659
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:08,580
or foreign time periods and be like, man, it'd be wild if this happened, huh? But it is already

660
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:13,940
happening. Like, there is so much of that, that is the, like, it doesn't matter until you come.

661
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,540
Buy my mixtape.

662
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:25,700
But there is so much of that, like, of that, that like moral immediacy as well, where it doesn't

663
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:30,580
matter unless it's happening to you, or it doesn't matter unless you can conceive of it happening to

664
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:35,620
you. I mean, it's something we've talked about a ton before around like all of the AI doomerism

665
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:41,700
stuff. And, you know, it's the, you know, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, whoever, whatever, whatever,

666
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:47,460
right? The whole idea they have to create like an evil AI God that's going to exterminate the world

667
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:53,220
is because they are in such powerful and privileged positions that it's like literally

668
01:13:53,220 --> 01:14:02,980
the only threat they can conceive of to themselves is an evil AI God who destroys everything in the

669
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:08,900
world, not just them, right? Everything in the world. And, you know, I think you see it a lot

670
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:15,060
in the way that people do talk about, like, AI ethics or the politics of AI or the consequences

671
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:26,580
of AI is, you know, so often it is about, like, the bad, hey, bad stuff could happen to other

672
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:34,180
people, or rather, what if the bad stuff happened to me, you know? And I think it is, you know,

673
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:39,060
this might be a good place to wrap it up. But I think it's also really telling as well where

674
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:49,780
you have a system like Hapsara, which its whole design is to generate Hamas targets for

675
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:57,860
assassination, right? And it has apparently an extremely broad definition of who is classified

676
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:04,740
as a Hamas operative or a relationship to Hamas. You know, it's like we were talking about before

677
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:08,980
where it's like, you know, as long as you can justify that there's like, you know, half of a

678
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:14,660
floor of a 10-story building was at one point related to Hamas, well, then you can take down

679
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:21,460
the whole building. I think a lot of people might be in for a real rude awakening, too, that, like,

680
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:30,260
you know, their idea that this activism is, you know, that they are doing a good thing

681
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:35,060
because they are caring about other, like, foreign people, you know, but except when they reach the

682
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:42,900
limits of care for foreign people or other time periods or other places or whatever it is that,

683
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:49,140
like, you know, they can't imagine that this stuff might come for them one day. And so that kind of

684
01:15:49,140 --> 01:16:00,020
limits their ability to speak out about it, to rally against it, to draw attention to its,

685
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:07,620
you know, horrendous and atrocious actuality, right? Like, they can't imagine it might come

686
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:14,580
for them one day. Hey, I'm not a Hamas. I'm not a terrorist. I'm not Palestinian. I'm not a climate

687
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:20,660
refugee. You know, I'm not any of these things. I don't have to worry about that as much, you know?

688
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:28,740
But consider as well, it don't take long for all of a sudden those boundaries to get real loose

689
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:35,220
and real fluid and to start capturing a lot more people than you can think of. You know, I just

690
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:44,260
think of, like, all of the governments around the world, the UK, Australia, the US, like, all the

691
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:50,740
governments talking about these massive rallies for Palestinian rights, rallies for ceasefire,

692
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:59,940
rallies against the Israeli-led genocide. You know, just think about, for example, like,

693
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:07,380
high up people in the UK government, they're crying, the half million people marching,

694
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:14,900
the millions of people marching as all Hamas sympathizers, you know? Got a whole lot of Hamas

695
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:20,340
sympathizers all of a sudden, all these, you know, and it ain't just, you know,

696
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:28,260
cross-punk leftist out there. You know, if you've been out on the marches, it's just a lot of normal

697
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:35,620
middle-class families with their kids, you know, out there marching for Palestinian rights,

698
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:41,540
marching for a ceasefire, marching against genocide. You know, all of those people are

699
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:48,820
being painted as Hamas operatives or Hamas sympathizers. I mean, listen, it makes them,

700
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:56,420
it makes them a legitimate target for Habsara to spit out one day in that regard.

701
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:03,940
I have some, yeah, I should tweet out to the IDF. I have information about Donald Trump that might

702
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:12,340
make him a power target for you guys. May Allah awaken the people and help them to see the

703
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:18,340
evildoings of Israel and the United States. But yeah, no, I think you're right. All the data

704
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:26,020
Habsara needs to spit out Trump's name next. Trump Tower. It revealed to us that on the,

705
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:34,180
on the half of, in one room, in one corner office on the 67th floor, Trump sent out

706
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:43,860
a tweet that said, may Allah awaken the people, may Allah open the people's eyes and awaken them

707
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:48,900
to the evildoings of Israel and the United States. We got to take the whole thing down guys. I'm sorry.

708
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:59,060
Fair is fair. Yeah, I mean, this is, you know, we don't need to talk about like,

709
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:04,580
this is the danger of these systems, because the danger of these systems is already readily

710
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:10,260
apparent. It is clear and present, right? That like, you know, these systems,

711
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:17,060
and you know, are causing, right, whether they are causing it directly, they are causing it

712
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:24,580
in some kind of, you know, giving cover for it, whatever it might be, right? These systems are

713
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:33,700
already leading to the mass assassination, mass destruction, right? But it doesn't end there,

714
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:41,700
right? If you can't, if what it takes for someone to relate to this, to empathize, to sympathize,

715
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:48,740
to speak out against, to scream their head off about if what it takes is for you to conceive

716
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:56,900
that one day, it might not only affect exotic brown people, or it might not only be some,

717
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:02,900
you know, sci fi near future. If what it takes is for you to conceive of how you yourself might

718
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:09,300
get caught up in the system. It don't take a lot of imagination to see how that's not only possible,

719
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:15,700
but increasingly likely as we see governments act in more and more authoritarian ways,

720
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:28,820
use technology to justify and expand the powers that they have, use fascist policies and propaganda

721
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:37,540
to create targets to call people human animals. As the defensemen, as the Israeli defense minister

722
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:43,140
said after October 7th, quote, we are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.

723
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:52,340
To consider how that broad categorization of human animals is a fluid and dynamic category

724
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:58,500
that can begin to include a lot of people in a lot of different places under a lot of certain

725
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:05,860
circumstances. You don't have to think hard and you don't have to think long to understand how

726
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:12,980
these systems may not only come for you one day, they are already coming for you.

727
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:19,380
They are already coming for people who, you know, all around the world, they are already causing

728
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:27,300
and wreaking death and destruction. No, you're telling me that the IDF who trains with American

729
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:34,660
police departments might one day export the gospel, which is kind of, you know,

730
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,780
if it weren't so grim, it is kind of funny for them to export the gospel to the United States.

731
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:45,780
But, you know, that's besides the point. It's dark and grim, actually, right? You're telling

732
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:54,260
me that they would export that to America? Oh, man, unprecedented. Surely not something that,

733
01:21:54,500 --> 01:22:00,340
you know, journalists like Anthony Loewenstein have written a whole book about. Surely not

734
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:08,020
something that we did a long episode with them about this whole very lucrative economy of exporting

735
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:15,780
the technologies of apartheid and genocide to the rest of the world. No, no, I can't imagine it,

736
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:24,180
Ed, which is why Aaron, I cannot imagine there and I do not speak. Right. Right.

737
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:30,820
Fucking hell. Well, I think I'm going to.

738
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,140
Don't worry, guys, the next episode will also be depressing.

739
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:42,820
Well, as long as the world keeps beating us down, we have to pass on those beatings to our dear

740
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:47,700
listeners. The negative project continues. You're absolutely right.

741
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:20,340
Thank you to our dear subscribers. And like I said, this episode will be released very shortly

742
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:28,500
after it goes up on the Patreon feed. So I will speak to you, all of our listeners who are

743
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:36,980
non-subscribers, please sign up and support the work that we do. It really does keep us going.

744
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:43,620
And doing these kinds of episodes, having these discussions. And so we appreciate that support,

745
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:52,020
as always. And more importantly, go fucking talk to people about this stuff. Help spread some

746
01:23:52,020 --> 01:24:00,260
awareness, some outrage, some attention on these things that really need to be. I mean,

747
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:08,100
this shit is clearly, I think, just these are these are war crimes. They go against even our

748
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:15,940
completely inadequate liberal system of international law. These things violate that

749
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:22,900
to such an extreme degree in such an obvious way. Right. Like these are technologies that

750
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:37,700
do not deserve to exist and indeed should be outlawed, smashed in every way. These are weapons

751
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:48,340
of mass destruction, weapons of mass assassination. And as such, we need to talk about it. We need to

752
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:54,180
bring attention to it. We need to fight against it. We need to advocate against it, whatever it

753
01:24:54,180 --> 01:25:00,340
takes. You know, but so with that, thank you everybody for listening. Thanks for your support.

754
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:03,700
And we will catch you next time later.

755
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:39,700
So

756
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,700
it's

757
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,700
you
