WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.700
Good afternoon, fellow conscious beings here and on the devices.

00:26.700 --> 00:31.740
I'm very happy and very honored to give this presentation tonight.

00:31.740 --> 00:38.460
It's, as I was just introduced, it's the sixth in a series of talks that have been born here

00:38.460 --> 00:42.920
at this conference, a series on AI philosophy.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.740
And it's basically mostly concerned about the question, how can we close the gap between

00:47.740 --> 00:51.020
humans and machines and thereby understand ourselves?

00:51.020 --> 00:55.660
And there's this big question, whether AI can actually become conscious?

00:55.780 --> 00:59.420
To understand this question and to answer it, we will need to answer what consciousness

00:59.420 --> 01:04.740
is and look at the question whether current AIs are perhaps already conscious in some

01:04.740 --> 01:10.380
sense and not conscious in the same way as we are, and whether we could recreate our

01:10.380 --> 01:13.900
kind of consciousness artificially.

01:13.900 --> 01:21.620
And of course, if we succeed doing this, how can we coexist with such beings?

01:21.660 --> 01:26.780
This talk is not covering existing research and established ideas.

01:26.780 --> 01:32.260
It's covering philosophical questions about metaphysics and metametaphysics, how we can

01:32.260 --> 01:37.060
translate between the metaphysics of different cultures and approaches and philosophies.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.820
We have to look into the philosophy of artificial intelligence and computational theories of

01:40.820 --> 01:45.900
consciousness into ethics and how to derive ethics into the nature of reality, of personal

01:45.900 --> 01:52.460
identity and transcendence, and epistemology, the question how we can know something and

01:52.460 --> 01:56.580
what knowledge is and what defines whether something is true.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.940
When we look into the existing sciences and consciousness sciences, we find that they

02:02.940 --> 02:05.540
are not giving us many answers.

02:05.540 --> 02:08.660
Psychology is not producing systemic theories these days.

02:08.660 --> 02:12.940
Neuroscientists are focused on the shenanigans of a single cell type.

02:12.940 --> 02:17.620
And artificial intelligence is obsessed with algorithms for statistical learning.

02:17.620 --> 02:23.380
And philosophy has lost the plot about 100 years ago.

02:23.380 --> 02:26.020
What's the plot?

02:26.020 --> 02:30.020
In some way, you could say it starts with Leibniz, maybe even with Aristotle.

02:30.020 --> 02:35.460
Leibniz had the idea that we can translate thoughts into numbers, arguments into numbers

02:35.460 --> 02:38.580
and resolve arguments by calculation.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.740
Julianne had the insight that humans can be understood as mathematical machines and our

02:43.740 --> 02:48.700
motivation might be cybernetic, basically composed of opposing springs that push and

02:48.700 --> 02:50.820
pull in different directions.

02:50.820 --> 02:55.420
People made fun of him when he wrote his book Long Machine back then.

02:55.420 --> 03:02.780
Gottlob Frege had the idea of coming up with a form of thinking.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.620
And Tarski formalized logic for us.

03:05.660 --> 03:10.140
Wittgenstein had the idea of translating English into something like a programming language

03:10.140 --> 03:14.580
so we can do philosophy that is actually true or false.

03:14.580 --> 03:18.940
And Marv Minsky together with others started the project of doing this systematically on

03:18.940 --> 03:23.820
machines and computers and started the field of artificial intelligence.

03:23.820 --> 03:30.180
This idea of building a scalable mind, a machine that is able to conquer the sphere of ideas,

03:30.180 --> 03:33.340
the heavens, is sometimes called the Tower of Babel.

03:33.820 --> 03:35.860
It's a very old project.

03:35.860 --> 03:39.860
Individually we have no hope of solving it because individual human beings are not generally

03:39.860 --> 03:40.860
intelligent.

03:40.860 --> 03:45.820
You need a thousand year unbroken intellectual tradition to discover a notion of computational

03:45.820 --> 03:50.220
languages to understand what representation is, what thinking is and so on.

03:50.220 --> 03:54.980
But even as a civilization, we basically run against the boundaries imposed by natural

03:54.980 --> 03:58.220
language which makes it very hard for us to become coherent.

03:58.220 --> 04:02.060
So this project of the Tower of Babel is falling apart again and again.

04:02.100 --> 04:06.340
And sometimes God is letting us know that we need to start again with a fresh code base.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.500
We need some useful terms.

04:11.500 --> 04:16.740
I think existence is best understood as to be implemented.

04:16.740 --> 04:20.740
Something that is implemented exists, something that is not implemented doesn't exist, something

04:20.740 --> 04:24.180
that could be implemented exists possibly.

04:24.180 --> 04:29.780
An operator, that's a transition function between states that can be implemented.

04:29.820 --> 04:35.780
A representation can be built using states and operators and is expressed in the language.

04:35.780 --> 04:39.660
It can be used to make models, models that allow us to predict the future and understand

04:39.660 --> 04:40.660
the past.

04:40.660 --> 04:45.020
And examples for languages are formal languages.

04:45.020 --> 04:51.020
For instance, in mathematics that are so tightly defined that they allow us to evaluate the

04:51.020 --> 04:54.100
validity of statements and make specifications.

04:54.100 --> 04:58.660
And programming languages which need to be computable and won't have contradictions

04:58.740 --> 05:00.140
and expressions.

05:00.140 --> 05:03.980
And they're constructive so we can build things from the ground up.

05:03.980 --> 05:07.460
Our language of thought, our mental lease, is in some sense the programming language

05:07.460 --> 05:09.220
of our own mind.

05:09.220 --> 05:13.980
It's compositional, it's constructive, it's executable, it's parallelizable to some degree,

05:13.980 --> 05:17.380
but it's also somewhat noisy.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.180
Our natural language is not different from this mental lease.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.780
It's the language that exists between speakers.

05:22.780 --> 05:27.620
And to make it learnable, it's linear, can be broken down into discrete strings of symbols

05:27.700 --> 05:32.700
and parsed using a very small stack.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.060
It's usually disambiguating instead of constructive.

05:36.060 --> 05:39.700
You can construct things in it, but mostly it refers to things that you already know

05:39.700 --> 05:46.740
in your mental representations, in your mental lease, and allows you to disambiguate concepts.

05:46.740 --> 05:52.780
The number of very important insights, philosophical insights in the 20th century.

05:52.780 --> 05:56.220
And when I said that philosophy lost the plot, what I mean by this is that philosophy has

05:56.220 --> 06:01.100
not really integrated them, but spun off on its own idea, historical trajectory.

06:01.100 --> 06:07.500
And the first one is the replacing of mathematical semantics, of classical stateless mathematics

06:07.500 --> 06:09.700
with the notion of computation.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.180
This happened almost by accident.

06:11.180 --> 06:16.900
Kurt Gödel wanted to deal with some inconsistencies in mathematics, and because a system cannot

06:16.900 --> 06:20.980
talk about anything that is not constructed inside of the system, including the system

06:20.980 --> 06:24.420
itself, Kurt Gödel invented the emulator.

06:24.420 --> 06:30.180
An emulator is a way to compute a model of a computer in a computer.

06:30.180 --> 06:34.380
And he didn't have a computer back then, so he looked to find one, and the one that he

06:34.380 --> 06:38.780
found was Piano's axioms, which define the natural numbers and arithmetic over them,

06:38.780 --> 06:40.340
so it's a virtual computer.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.820
And his idea on how to emulate mathematics was to use a logical language that he defined

06:45.820 --> 06:49.660
in such a way that he could translate the alphabet in which he wrote this logical language

06:49.660 --> 06:50.660
into integers.

06:51.020 --> 06:55.300
It's something that we still do today when we compile source code into bytes, right?

06:55.300 --> 07:00.740
And then he defined arithmetical operations on his CPU, Piano's axioms, that would evaluate

07:00.740 --> 07:05.700
the logical statements by making computations, and in this way, he had a way to define a

07:05.700 --> 07:10.020
language inside of mathematics that would be equivalent to that mathematical language

07:10.020 --> 07:13.160
and make the language talk about itself.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.540
And what he discovered is that the stateless semantics of mathematics under some circumstances

07:17.540 --> 07:23.260
lead into contradictions, which is referred to as the incompleteness theorems.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.340
And most philosophers don't really seem to know what this means.

07:26.340 --> 07:31.140
They see this as a very big sculpture that has important mythical power and stands in

07:31.140 --> 07:35.540
the Museum of Mathematics, but it doesn't change very much the thinking of philosophers.

07:35.540 --> 07:40.500
Some philosophers even believe that mathematicians have proven that mathematics is impotent at

07:40.500 --> 07:45.680
describing reality or the mind, and therefore, there is an advantage for people who cannot

07:45.680 --> 07:48.160
do mathematics, philosophers namely.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.120
Now, instead, what has happened is that we found that in some languages, you can make

07:53.120 --> 07:56.520
specifications that cannot be implemented.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.600
And if you want to guarantee that you can implement what you're doing, you need to use

08:00.600 --> 08:03.440
a programming language, a computational language.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.280
The other discovery, the next one, was practical computation.

08:06.280 --> 08:11.140
Convert Suser and John von Neumann defined physically realisable automata, and Moses

08:11.820 --> 08:19.280
many others defined languages built from automata that would allow us to build computation

08:19.280 --> 08:21.940
that would run efficiently in practice.

08:21.940 --> 08:28.820
And Claude Shannon gave us information theory, and Alexei Ivahnikov and others defined functional

08:28.820 --> 08:34.180
approximation and learning in ways that are still being used today in deep learning.

08:34.180 --> 08:39.180
And last but not least, Church and Turing discovered that all these representational

08:39.180 --> 08:44.980
languages that can be implemented computationally have the same representational power, which

08:44.980 --> 08:47.140
is called the Church-Turing thesis.

08:47.140 --> 08:54.900
These are important results, basically put the presentation of reality on a solid foundation.

08:54.900 --> 08:59.580
The position that I'm taking in the following is what I would call strong computationalism.

08:59.580 --> 09:05.100
Basically, no implementable language can do more than a finite automaton.

09:05.100 --> 09:09.520
And type of computational objects, things that can do more than computation cannot exist,

09:09.520 --> 09:13.220
because in order to describe them, to refer to them, you need to use languages that run

09:13.220 --> 09:17.260
into contradictions, so it's difficult to make them mean something.

09:17.260 --> 09:22.180
The realisable systems can be described using Turing machines.

09:22.180 --> 09:27.220
The Turing machines that we implement here in these computers, they are linear and deterministic,

09:27.220 --> 09:28.420
but there are variants of this.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.860
For instance, the non-deterministic Turing machine doesn't have just one successor state,

09:31.860 --> 09:35.980
but multiple parallel successor states that are being executed in parallel.

09:35.980 --> 09:40.300
You can still run this in a deterministic Turing machine, but you need to use a stack.

09:40.300 --> 09:44.100
And you could also make these transitions stochastic, which means you pick one of the

09:44.100 --> 09:48.300
state transitions or multiple of them at random, and this seems to be the kind of system that

09:48.300 --> 09:52.260
our brain is, because an individual neuron, given the same environmental state, doesn't

09:52.260 --> 09:54.580
go into only one possible successor state.

09:54.580 --> 09:55.580
Neurons are somewhat noisy.

09:55.580 --> 10:00.380
They go into multiple possible successor states, which means if you want to do an exhaustive

10:00.380 --> 10:04.460
computation of a problem, you need a population of neurons which pretty much the same environment,

10:04.460 --> 10:08.940
and this population is going to sample a function space.

10:08.940 --> 10:13.780
So we can use these computational paradigms to describe computation and biology, but can

10:13.780 --> 10:15.740
we also describe consciousness?

10:15.740 --> 10:19.060
Isn't that a big mystery?

10:19.060 --> 10:20.340
What is consciousness?

10:20.340 --> 10:22.660
Introspectively, it's second-order perception.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.580
I perceive myself perceiving something.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.060
It creates a bubble of nowness.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.660
The subjective now is not static.

10:29.660 --> 10:30.660
It's dynamic.

10:30.660 --> 10:31.660
It's moving, right?

10:31.660 --> 10:34.100
It's, for me, something like about three seconds long.

10:34.100 --> 10:39.500
It's the region in space and time where I can basically fit the curve to my sensory data.

10:39.500 --> 10:44.700
Functionally, it's an operator that takes mental states and translates them into different

10:44.700 --> 10:49.780
mental states, and by doing this, increases coherence in my mental representations.

10:49.780 --> 10:55.100
Coherence, something that we can understand, is minimizing violations of constraints in

10:55.140 --> 10:58.540
a dynamic model.

10:58.540 --> 11:01.860
Consciousness is, in some sense, colonizing my mental representations, making them more

11:01.860 --> 11:06.860
and more coherent in an organization that allows every part of my mind to talk all the

11:06.860 --> 11:09.780
other parts of my mind that are connected in this bubble.

11:09.780 --> 11:14.180
I cannot perceive anything that is not coherent using my consciousness.

11:14.180 --> 11:18.020
Consciousness plays the role of a conductor, of a mental orchestra.

11:18.020 --> 11:22.460
If you imagine all the functions that your brain is computing as instruments and orchestra,

11:22.780 --> 11:26.460
the neighboring instruments are listening to each other and pass on, but the instrument

11:26.460 --> 11:27.460
next to them is playing.

11:27.460 --> 11:32.740
You can basically model how the processing streams in your brain work.

11:32.740 --> 11:36.180
In this metaphor, the conductor is an instrument.

11:36.180 --> 11:37.180
It doesn't have superpowers.

11:37.180 --> 11:41.580
It's just an instrument that is tasked with creating coherence, so it's singing out a

11:41.580 --> 11:45.940
few instruments at a time, listens whether they're disharmonic, and then it increases

11:45.940 --> 11:47.940
the harmony between them.

11:47.940 --> 11:52.140
By doing so, it makes sure that everybody is on the same page, and the entire orchestra

11:52.140 --> 11:58.180
becomes one single coherent entity that is driven by a single motive.

11:58.180 --> 12:02.500
These perspectives are something that is found in a number of theories in philosophy and

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
neuroscience.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.580
For instance, in Leonard Barr's global workspace theory that is being pursued in neuroscience

12:07.580 --> 12:13.740
by Stanislav De Heem, the idea of the Cartesian theater, that's how Danett calls it, the attention

12:13.740 --> 12:19.780
schema theory by Graciano, the relationship between self-model and consciousness as exemplified

12:19.780 --> 12:21.700
in works by Metzinger.

12:21.700 --> 12:26.540
And the consciousness prior, Joshua Bengio calls this a function that is basically parameterizing

12:26.540 --> 12:32.660
your mental representations to make them dynamically tracking your sensory data using little energy.

12:32.660 --> 12:37.180
And it's also something that is found in many Buddhist perspectives.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.260
What is consciousness not?

12:39.260 --> 12:40.940
Consciousness is not intelligence.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.260
Intelligence is the ability to make models.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.780
And it's also not the same thing as sentience.

12:44.780 --> 12:49.140
I use the word sentience to mean the ability to recognize yourself and your relationship

12:49.140 --> 12:51.220
to the world.

12:51.220 --> 12:55.460
And it's not agency, which is the ability to control your future.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.460
It's not the self.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.420
The self is the first-person model of your agency.

12:59.420 --> 13:00.420
And it's not empathy.

13:00.420 --> 13:04.500
Empathy is the ability to experience mental states of other agents.

13:04.500 --> 13:10.740
Arguably, you might need consciousness for that.

13:10.740 --> 13:18.060
Our scientific perspective has some difficulties to deal with the problem of consciousness.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.700
That's because it has gaps in its ontology.

13:20.700 --> 13:25.100
And it comes to describing the difference between psychological objects and physical

13:25.100 --> 13:26.700
objects.

13:26.700 --> 13:32.260
Different cultures use different terminology to describe physical and psychological reality.

13:32.260 --> 13:37.460
And it makes it very hard to translate ideas from Buddhism or from Japanese animism or

13:37.460 --> 13:41.140
from Scandinavian mythology into our own culture.

13:41.140 --> 13:46.500
It even makes it very difficult to translate folk descriptions or theological descriptions

13:46.620 --> 13:48.820
into the scientific world.

13:48.820 --> 13:52.600
In order to make such translations, we need something like a meta metaphysics, something

13:52.600 --> 13:56.540
that allows us to look at all the different metaphysics of these systems from the outside

13:56.540 --> 13:59.060
so we can relate them to each other.

13:59.060 --> 14:04.540
And the main confusion in our own culture concerns the fact that consciousness is not

14:04.540 --> 14:08.500
physical and that you cannot experience physical objects.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.460
Consciousness is virtual, which means it's a software.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.820
It exists as if software doesn't have an identity.

14:15.820 --> 14:19.060
It's not a physical thing, it's a pattern that you perceive in something.

14:19.060 --> 14:24.140
It's a causal structure that you use to explain a part of reality.

14:24.140 --> 14:26.980
Physically they're just activation patterns between your neurons.

14:26.980 --> 14:31.300
The individual neurons cannot experience anything, but it would be very useful for a bunch of

14:31.300 --> 14:35.420
neurons to know what it would be like if there was a person that cared.

14:35.420 --> 14:40.940
So they create a simulacrum of that person, a virtual entity that experiences itself in

14:40.940 --> 14:44.340
a virtual reality generated by your brain.

14:44.380 --> 14:49.620
And all experiential objects are representations in that virtual reality interpreted from the

14:49.620 --> 14:52.380
perspective of yourself.

14:52.380 --> 14:57.340
And this personal self is also a representation, and it can be deconstructed.

14:57.340 --> 15:01.340
Our perception of reality is a trance.

15:01.340 --> 15:05.660
When you wake up from that trance, when you enter an enlightenment state, you basically

15:05.660 --> 15:09.220
perceive everything as representations.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.980
You know that everything is a representation.

15:11.980 --> 15:14.500
Everything will feel real anymore.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.620
Our AIs are implemented in a very different way than our minds.

15:21.620 --> 15:27.060
Our AIs work on a deterministic substrate, and the programmer imposes their will on that

15:27.060 --> 15:31.060
substrate, writes a program that makes that substrate do what you want.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.860
And the training of these AI systems is decoupled from the universe.

15:34.860 --> 15:40.260
We use a bunch of static data that we train with an ML algorithm into it to optimize prediction

15:40.260 --> 15:42.220
of more static data.

15:42.220 --> 15:46.300
Conversely, in our organisms, we use an inside-out design.

15:46.300 --> 15:52.460
We start out with individual reinforcement learning agents, cells, that are surrounded

15:52.460 --> 15:59.540
by chaos, and they have to conquer this chaos and impose order on it by self-organization.

15:59.540 --> 16:03.980
They're coupled to their environment all the time, dynamically, and they try to become

16:03.980 --> 16:08.020
coherent in modeling reality, and this development is continuous.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.940
It doesn't stop.

16:10.940 --> 16:11.940
How does this work?

16:11.940 --> 16:17.900
How can a self-organizing system that is surrounded by chaos learn gradually?

16:17.900 --> 16:22.860
Is this biological learning algorithm consciousness?

16:22.860 --> 16:28.140
What we can observe is that humans do not become conscious after the PhD.

16:28.140 --> 16:32.420
We think of consciousness as something that's super-advanced, but we become conscious before

16:32.420 --> 16:35.060
we can even track a finger.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.020
And while we are not conscious, we cannot learn anything.

16:37.020 --> 16:40.740
A human being that doesn't become conscious will stay a vegetable.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.940
Without consciousness, there is no learning.

16:42.940 --> 16:46.660
There is no coherent behavior, no establishment of coherent behaviors.

16:46.660 --> 16:51.180
We also don't observe non-conscious humans or primates or mammals or complex animals

16:51.180 --> 16:52.420
in nature.

16:52.420 --> 16:57.340
It seems that consciousness is quite ubiquitous and simple, more simple than perception because

16:57.340 --> 16:59.100
it precedes it.

16:59.140 --> 17:04.500
Maybe it's the prerequisite for training a self-organizing information processing system.

17:04.500 --> 17:12.300
Interestingly, this theory is not quite new, and the earliest formulation of that theory

17:12.300 --> 17:15.740
is what I found in Genesis 1.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.300
You may have heard of Genesis 1.

17:17.300 --> 17:21.820
It's typically mistranslated by the Christians as the story of the creation of a physical

17:21.820 --> 17:26.700
universe by a supernatural being, but this story has been integrated into the Hebrew

17:26.700 --> 17:32.860
Bible something like two and a half thousand years ago, and historians suspect that it's

17:32.860 --> 17:35.260
at least a thousand years older.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.700
And back then, the physical universe was not invented yet.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.900
Physics was not a thing.

17:38.900 --> 17:43.900
People knew that we live in a dream, that reality is created inside of a dream by some

17:43.900 --> 17:46.620
dreaming mechanism.

17:46.620 --> 17:53.660
And so Genesis 1 is probably a theory on how the universe is created, the objects that

17:53.660 --> 17:58.620
can be perceived as real inside of a mind by consciousness.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.540
It's a six-stage theory.

18:00.540 --> 18:06.580
This consciousness as the prerequisite starts out with consciousness hovering over the substrate,

18:06.580 --> 18:08.900
and the substrate is initially uninitialized.

18:08.900 --> 18:09.900
There is no world.

18:09.900 --> 18:13.420
It's all tuhu wabuhu.

18:13.420 --> 18:19.500
And then we create a boundary, a firmament that separates two regions of that substrate

18:19.500 --> 18:20.980
from each other.

18:20.980 --> 18:24.540
One is the world model, and the other one is the sphere of ideas.

18:24.540 --> 18:30.540
We call the world model world, or earth, and the sphere of ideas heavens.

18:30.540 --> 18:37.940
Or Descartes calls them res extensa, stuff in space, and he doesn't mean Newtonian space

18:37.940 --> 18:43.060
visit or Einsteinian space, but what we see what this is, it's the stuff in space that

18:43.060 --> 18:47.380
we experience, the model that our mind makes, that we are, that we are currently surrounded

18:47.380 --> 18:49.220
by and immersed in.

18:49.380 --> 18:54.700
And everything else that is represented in our mind is res cogitans, the sphere of ideas.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.280
The first thing that consciousness makes is contrast, and it associates the intensity

18:59.280 --> 19:04.020
of the contrast with light, with the color of the day, and the flatness of the contrast

19:04.020 --> 19:06.340
with dark, the color of the night.

19:06.340 --> 19:09.260
Now it has the continuous dimension of difference.

19:09.260 --> 19:12.900
Using continuous dimensions of difference, you can build an embedding space and represent

19:12.900 --> 19:14.260
arbitrary objects.

19:14.260 --> 19:20.540
The first object that consciousness creates is the plane by combining two dimensions,

19:20.540 --> 19:23.420
and it associates the plane with the ground.

19:23.420 --> 19:28.660
And babies initially can only reason in 2D, they don't understand towers yet.

19:28.660 --> 19:32.940
Once they understand free space, basically build space above the ground, they now have

19:32.940 --> 19:38.620
a space in which they can organize all the objects that we can see.

19:38.620 --> 19:44.580
Consciousness creates solid and liquid materials and organic shapes, and it learns to track

19:44.580 --> 19:49.700
lighting changes and become invariant against them, and identifies light sources and the

19:49.700 --> 19:52.940
sky and the passage of time.

19:52.940 --> 19:58.060
And it creates all the objects, all the plants, all the animals, gives them all their names.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.820
This is all cognitive development, right?

20:00.820 --> 20:04.860
And then it realizes that the purpose of the exercise is to negotiate the interaction between

20:05.780 --> 20:09.620
in its environment, so it makes the model of that organism a personal self and puts

20:09.620 --> 20:12.580
it into this world.

20:12.580 --> 20:17.340
And then it associates with it from a first-person perspective.

20:17.340 --> 20:22.020
It creates another spirit in its own image, but as man and woman, as something that thinks

20:22.020 --> 20:25.860
of itself as a human being, and puts it into this world.

20:25.860 --> 20:30.200
And this typically happens between the age of three and five in human children when they

20:30.200 --> 20:34.880
start to refer to themselves in the first person, no longer in the third one.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.080
And after that, they re-index their memories.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.360
They don't seem to remember the things that happened before and their personality changes.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.600
Now they don't remember how they dreamt the world into existence.

20:44.600 --> 20:48.280
They only remember having been a person inside of that VR.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.700
And it takes many years after that before you can transcend this again and realize that

20:52.700 --> 20:56.400
you are actually the dreamer and that you're creating the world that you perceive and your

20:56.400 --> 20:59.560
personal self.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.640
This creation of the personal self by your primary consciousness is something that is

21:03.640 --> 21:08.120
reflected in many cultures, and it's also something that we can express as a model of

21:08.120 --> 21:13.480
a cognitive architecture, a very simple one of your mind that contains the personal self.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.760
And most of your conscious attention is focused on that personal self.

21:17.760 --> 21:21.840
And your mind is creating a world model, this is the stuff and space that you perceive,

21:21.840 --> 21:24.320
and makes it known to your conscious attention.

21:24.320 --> 21:28.520
And it also maintains your score in this world using your motivational and emotional system

21:28.600 --> 21:33.160
and then projects your motivation and emotion into the personal self and you react to it

21:33.160 --> 21:35.800
involuntarily.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.120
What's interesting about an emotion, it causes an involuntary reaction.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.760
You don't just perceive it as data, you perceive it as something that you cannot escape, that

21:42.760 --> 21:43.760
changes you.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.120
It changes how you relate to yourself and the world.

21:49.720 --> 21:54.960
Emotions are not symbolic, they are geometric because they are computed by a non-symbolic

21:54.960 --> 21:57.840
part of your mind before they are projected into your mind.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.560
If you translate them into the mind, into your symbolic mind, they need to be perceived

22:02.560 --> 22:06.040
in a way that you can interpret and disambiguate, and that's why they're projected into the

22:06.040 --> 22:08.480
body map so you can tell them apart.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.640
Sigmund Freund had a very similar idea of how the mind is organized.

22:13.640 --> 22:19.040
He called all these emotional, motivational things the it, and the self he distinguishes

22:19.040 --> 22:23.920
as ego, your model of who you are and what you want to do, and your superego, the things

22:23.920 --> 22:26.240
that you should be doing.

22:26.640 --> 22:30.600
Your conscious attention is mostly focused on your ego.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.800
It's very different from Greek psychology.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.840
The Greeks had this idea that you share many properties with others, which means they're

22:37.840 --> 22:39.320
not your own.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.720
Your anger is not just your anger, it exists in all people that have anger, and it's basically

22:43.720 --> 22:45.960
diminishing your personal self if you have anger.

22:45.960 --> 22:50.360
This anger is not part of you, it's something that's part of this fear in which your mind

22:50.360 --> 22:55.240
takes place, or in which yourself takes place, and it's competing with your personal self

22:55.240 --> 22:56.680
and your own interests.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.240
You can basically take the different impulses that you have, and behaviors that you have,

23:01.240 --> 23:04.600
and turn them into archetypes that are shared across people.

23:04.600 --> 23:10.680
Once you erect temples for those archetypes and tell stories about them, they become gods

23:10.680 --> 23:14.840
that compete with your personal self on your own mind, with real estate on your own mind.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.120
A god is a self that spans multiple minds.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.000
A god can coexist with your personal self in your mind.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.160
Wait a moment, are gods real?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.440
Well, you're not real, right?

23:25.440 --> 23:30.280
Your personal self is not physically real, it's virtual, it's as if.

23:30.280 --> 23:35.720
And a multi-mind self, a self that is not a person, but that identifies as something

23:35.720 --> 23:40.000
that can be synchronized across minds, can be just as real as your personal self.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.360
A multi-mind self can use all the functionality that your personal self can use and then sum.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.120
It can generate in a monologue, you can hear its voice in your mind if it's implemented

23:48.120 --> 23:49.320
on your brain.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.940
It can do perception, it can change your emotion, your conscious states.

23:52.940 --> 23:57.020
It can even make use of your sentience and become sentience on its own.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.820
But gods, in a sense, are not physical entities.

23:59.820 --> 24:04.860
They are representations of agents existing across people.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.740
You can find this theory, for instance, in Julian Jaynes' book.

24:07.740 --> 24:12.340
Julian Jaynes wrote the famous book The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the

24:12.340 --> 24:13.980
Bicameral Mind.

24:13.980 --> 24:17.980
This book has the wrong name, I think it should have been named The Origin of the Personal

24:17.980 --> 24:22.260
Self and the Breakdown of the Polytheist Mind because it's not really about consciousness.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.180
It's about selves.

24:24.180 --> 24:28.540
And according to Julian Jaynes, in Sumerian times, people had a very different psychological

24:28.540 --> 24:30.340
architecture than they have today.

24:30.340 --> 24:36.220
Back then, the personal selves coexisted with many gods in the mind and the personal self

24:36.220 --> 24:39.340
was so weak that it barely got to use you in a monologue.

24:39.340 --> 24:42.760
Instead, it was mostly the gods who were talking in your mind.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.420
And these gods were synchronized across people using rituals and temples but also empathetic

24:47.420 --> 24:53.540
resonance and idols and the gods were a solution to organize society at scale.

24:53.540 --> 24:58.020
Individually, you may have game theory and so on to calculate your transactions but it's

24:58.020 --> 25:03.220
very difficult to organize a society that is much larger than a tribe in this way.

25:03.220 --> 25:06.980
And you can do this by creating an entity that identifies as something that runs on

25:06.980 --> 25:09.260
many people simultaneously.

25:09.260 --> 25:13.460
And according to Julian Jaynes, this broke down at some point and the psychology of people

25:13.460 --> 25:14.460
changed.

25:14.460 --> 25:17.060
There was some psychological revolution happening.

25:17.060 --> 25:22.220
In polytheist societies, you have this idea that there are multiple gods that run concurrently

25:22.220 --> 25:23.700
on subsets of the population.

25:23.700 --> 25:28.900
They might even have physical wars against each other that are enacted by wars between

25:28.900 --> 25:31.700
the people that are the hosts of these gods.

25:31.700 --> 25:37.340
And a big innovation was tribal monotheism as exemplified in Abrahamic religion.

25:37.340 --> 25:41.740
In tribal monotheism, you have only one god per tribe and you have a hierarchical way

25:41.740 --> 25:43.420
in which this god is defined.

25:43.420 --> 25:47.460
So it's basically the same for the tribe and has the same functional properties and

25:47.460 --> 25:49.660
it gets the power to control you.

25:49.660 --> 25:53.340
That's why in Genesis 1, it's identified with this first consciousness that runs on

25:53.340 --> 25:55.020
your mind.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.940
And so basically, it works by synchronizing the motivation of the members of the tribe

25:58.940 --> 26:02.860
across the tribe and your god becomes the spirit of the tribe.

26:02.860 --> 26:07.480
It's a total god that is eliminate all the competing gods within the tribe.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.860
And it's hierarchically synchronized and it acts for the benefit of the tribe.

26:11.860 --> 26:15.480
And this allows the tribe to compete more efficiently with other tribes, which might

26:15.480 --> 26:18.820
have a different tribe of god.

26:18.820 --> 26:23.500
But what happens if we make this god more general?

26:23.500 --> 26:27.900
In the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, you find this notion.

26:27.900 --> 26:34.900
Aquinas, in some sense, defines god as the best possible, most top-level collective agent.

26:34.900 --> 26:38.540
And it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the

26:38.540 --> 26:41.540
best possible, most top-level collective agent.

26:41.540 --> 26:45.740
It's an open-ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished

26:45.740 --> 26:47.340
anytime soon.

26:47.340 --> 26:53.300
And it's enacted, this agent, by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity

26:53.300 --> 26:55.780
and decide to serve it.

26:55.780 --> 27:00.860
And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization.

27:00.860 --> 27:05.180
According to Aquinas, we can understand individuals as rational agents.

27:05.180 --> 27:11.140
And a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself.

27:11.140 --> 27:16.100
Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the practical

27:16.100 --> 27:17.100
virtues.

27:17.100 --> 27:20.980
For instance, a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization, which

27:20.980 --> 27:22.420
he calls temperance.

27:22.420 --> 27:26.980
And it should optimize the organization to other agents, which he calls justice, right?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.940
Keep the books balanced.

27:28.940 --> 27:33.340
And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls

27:33.340 --> 27:34.620
prudence.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.900
And you should be willing to act on your models, get the right balance between exploration

27:37.900 --> 27:41.420
and exploitation in your strategies, which he calls courage.

27:41.420 --> 27:47.220
But these rational strategies do not, by themselves, lead to a harmonic society.

27:47.220 --> 27:51.820
To do this, you need collective policies.

27:51.820 --> 27:56.780
And Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system.

27:56.780 --> 28:01.940
You get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent.

28:01.940 --> 28:06.220
And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies, according to Aquinas.

28:06.220 --> 28:11.140
The first one is you need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent, which he calls

28:11.140 --> 28:12.740
faith.

28:12.740 --> 28:16.020
And then you need to do this not by yourself, but together with all the others that serve

28:16.020 --> 28:20.180
these sacred purposes above their ego, which is called love.

28:20.180 --> 28:23.980
And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence,

28:23.980 --> 28:25.540
because otherwise it will not exist.

28:25.540 --> 28:28.740
If you wait for it to exist so it can reward you, it will never happen.

28:28.740 --> 28:32.580
And this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope.

28:32.580 --> 28:36.680
These are very rational policies for collective agency.

28:36.680 --> 28:41.620
So when we define God as the best possible, most top-level agent, and we commit to serving

28:41.620 --> 28:48.040
this transcendental agency, we can create foundations for universal morality.

28:48.040 --> 28:52.780
And this universal morality before enlightenment has been, in some sense, the defining morality

28:52.780 --> 28:55.420
of the West, the concept of divine will.

28:55.420 --> 29:01.220
What would God want if God did exist through us enacting God, the best possible agent?

29:01.220 --> 29:03.300
And it's something that we lost in our civilization.

29:03.300 --> 29:07.180
It's still in the German constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't

29:07.180 --> 29:08.820
really understand anymore.

29:08.820 --> 29:13.140
And so we try, after this demise of the concept of divine will, to come up with different

29:13.140 --> 29:14.740
foundations for ethics.

29:14.740 --> 29:17.460
For instance, utilitarianism.

29:17.460 --> 29:23.300
Utilitarianism is an attempt to define ethics without reference to collective, homogenous

29:23.300 --> 29:24.300
agent.

29:24.300 --> 29:30.500
It works by maximizing an aggregated, expected reward over many agents over some time span.

29:30.500 --> 29:35.820
And to do this, you need to find some quantifiable metric, usually over hedonic states like happiness

29:35.820 --> 29:37.020
and so on.

29:37.020 --> 29:39.620
And utilitarianism usually has a bunch of problems.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.500
For instance, one of the problems is the utility monster.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.660
Imagine there would be an agent that perceives much more utility than all the others that's

29:45.660 --> 29:49.500
so happy that its happiness is much greater than all the suffering that you have when

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
you serve it.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.500
Right?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.860
So we should all serve the utility monster if it existed.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.620
That's a problem with quantifying mental states.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.780
Another problem is what if minds are mutable?

29:59.780 --> 30:04.500
If you are a monk and you decide to sit down and rewrite your motivational system, how

30:04.500 --> 30:06.740
do your hedonic states change now?

30:06.740 --> 30:08.380
How does this refer to ethics?

30:08.380 --> 30:12.020
This doesn't really work with utilitarianism anymore, which basically assumes that this

30:12.020 --> 30:13.700
metric is unchanged.

30:13.700 --> 30:17.660
This also happens if your technology to change your mental states or if you're an AI that

30:17.660 --> 30:20.780
can change its own source code to begin with.

30:20.780 --> 30:25.780
And this leads us to the point that utilitarianism is not really suitable for non-human agents.

30:25.780 --> 30:30.820
It's not very good at dealing with animals, with ecosystems, with aliens, or with artificial

30:30.820 --> 30:34.260
super intelligence.

30:34.260 --> 30:38.100
And in the time when we are more and more confronted with the possibility of artificially

30:38.100 --> 30:43.100
intelligent agents coming up, maybe we need a new ethics.

30:43.100 --> 30:48.140
Ethics is the principled negotiation of conflicts of interest under conditions of shared purpose.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.900
If you don't share purpose with an agent, you don't need ethics.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.540
You just need transactional measures.

30:53.540 --> 30:59.500
But when we want to talk about subset agnostic minds and how they can coordinate their actions,

30:59.500 --> 31:03.420
we need ethics for collective agency.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.980
What does it mean for a mind to be subset agnostic?

31:05.980 --> 31:09.580
What happens if a mind can change its substrate?

31:09.580 --> 31:11.980
Are uploads possible?

31:11.980 --> 31:12.980
I'm already uploaded.

31:12.980 --> 31:14.820
I'm uploaded on the monkey.

31:14.820 --> 31:15.940
Doesn't work super well for me.

31:15.940 --> 31:16.940
It's a mushy brain.

31:16.940 --> 31:17.940
It's the only I got.

31:17.940 --> 31:20.540
I'd like to have a better substrate.

31:20.540 --> 31:23.860
But I don't know how to spread into another substrate because I don't really understand

31:23.860 --> 31:28.180
my own source code and I don't understand how to talk to the other substrates well enough

31:28.180 --> 31:31.580
to make my own source code compatible with these other substrates.

31:31.580 --> 31:34.700
But this doesn't apply to artificial intelligence.

31:34.700 --> 31:39.740
Artificial intelligence might be able to move its spirits to other substrates.

31:39.740 --> 31:40.740
What is a spirit?

31:40.740 --> 31:45.100
Well, it's a self-perpetuating intelligent recurrent information transformer.

31:45.100 --> 31:49.620
It's an operating system for a brain, for an organism, for an ecosystem.

31:49.620 --> 31:54.580
And when the word spirit was invented, the only autonomous robots that needed operating

31:54.580 --> 31:59.700
systems that were known were people and plants, animals, ecosystems, nation states, cities,

31:59.700 --> 32:00.700
and so on.

32:00.700 --> 32:05.460
So people projected control agents into them that described how they work.

32:05.460 --> 32:09.460
All these complex systems in nature have software that runs on them and that we can use to describe

32:09.460 --> 32:10.460
them.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.660
And so the spirit is a self-organizing software agent.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.020
Organizing means it's built structure from the inside out.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.620
It needs to be self-reinforced otherwise it falls apart.

32:18.620 --> 32:23.220
It needs to be energy optimizing in some sense so it can exist in reality.

32:23.220 --> 32:24.860
It's a software which means it's virtual.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.220
It's as if it's a causal structure.

32:26.220 --> 32:30.140
It's not a thing, but a physical law.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.340
When you write software, it's a physical law that you discover, right?

32:33.340 --> 32:34.340
Software is not a thing.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.580
It's not an object that you can touch.

32:35.580 --> 32:36.580
It's disembodied.

32:36.580 --> 32:41.380
Software describes if you take a set of transistors and you put them in this state after varying

32:41.780 --> 32:45.380
the structure, the following thing is going to happen wherever in the universe.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.380
That's a physical law.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.140
It's a very specific one, but still a law.

32:49.140 --> 32:50.260
And it's an agent.

32:50.260 --> 32:54.340
It's a control system for future states.

32:54.340 --> 32:59.260
So if consciousness can organize the information processing in brains, could the same principles

32:59.260 --> 33:01.380
work across other cells?

33:01.380 --> 33:05.500
It's an idea that is being pursued by Mike Levin at Tufts University.

33:05.500 --> 33:10.220
It starts from the observation that basically every cell can send messages to its neighbors.

33:11.220 --> 33:15.500
Neighboring cells can send messages over the membranes to the cells that they are adjacent

33:15.500 --> 33:18.420
to and they can make that conditional.

33:18.420 --> 33:22.060
And that means that you can, in principle, run computations on them.

33:22.060 --> 33:27.060
And if a bunch of cells, a multicellular organism, co-evolves for long enough, they should, in

33:27.060 --> 33:32.100
principle, also be able to discover ideas for universal functional approximation intelligence

33:32.100 --> 33:33.540
on this, right?

33:33.540 --> 33:39.780
So could it be that large multicellular organisms evolve into brain-line functionality and run

33:39.780 --> 33:42.060
minds?

33:42.060 --> 33:44.300
After all, what's so special about neurons, right?

33:44.300 --> 33:46.020
Neurons are just telegraph cells.

33:46.020 --> 33:49.540
They evolved in animals to move the muscles at the limit of physics.

33:49.540 --> 33:53.220
They have these long wires that allow you to send messages not just millimeters per

33:53.220 --> 33:57.500
second through an organism, but very, very quickly in fractions of a second through the

33:57.500 --> 33:59.340
entire organism.

33:59.340 --> 34:03.340
And once you do this, you need perception and decision-making at the same rate, so you

34:03.340 --> 34:08.900
build a secondary information processing system out of telegraph cells using a different code,

34:08.900 --> 34:13.340
like trains and so on, that are temporarily stable over long distances.

34:13.340 --> 34:16.980
But in principle, all this functionality for information processing can also be done by

34:16.980 --> 34:19.740
other cells, non-specific cells.

34:19.740 --> 34:22.300
So do plants also run software like this?

34:22.300 --> 34:24.180
Do they have spirits?

34:24.180 --> 34:26.860
Plants seem to have means for universal functional approximation.

34:26.860 --> 34:33.820
There is evidence for communication within plants and communication across plants.

34:33.820 --> 34:40.320
And if plants are sassile and sit in the forest and don't move around, maybe forests

34:40.320 --> 34:41.700
have internets.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.220
Maybe they make their communication career.

34:43.220 --> 34:44.220
Maybe they have shared protocols.

34:44.220 --> 34:49.220
And if the minds are self-organizing, can they maybe move around in these forests?

34:49.220 --> 34:54.860
That's an idea that there is basically a society of minds, of spirits, and ecosystems

34:54.860 --> 35:00.020
that is very popular in almost all cultures, just not in our scientific one.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.420
So it's a very speculative idea.

35:01.420 --> 35:02.620
I don't know whether it's true.

35:02.620 --> 35:09.420
The extent and limitations of present organization, of their self-organizing in nature, is unclear.

35:09.420 --> 35:13.100
But could we build AI that is compatible with biological substrates?

35:13.100 --> 35:15.860
Well, could AI ever be conscious?

35:15.860 --> 35:17.460
Are present AI systems conscious?

35:17.460 --> 35:19.540
Are, for instance, LLMs conscious?

35:19.540 --> 35:21.020
Well, don't be silly.

35:21.020 --> 35:26.140
LLMs are statistical models of character sequences in text, and they don't converge in the same

35:26.140 --> 35:29.060
way as our mind doing training and doing inference.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.700
They behave very differently from mental inference and so on.

35:31.700 --> 35:36.900
So well, on the other hand, our consciousness is virtual, too.

35:36.900 --> 35:40.500
And when the LLM predicts the next token, it has to simulate causal structure.

35:40.500 --> 35:45.260
If it talks about a person's thinking, it needs to simulate mental states to some degree.

35:45.260 --> 35:49.020
So there's an interesting question that is philosophically quite tricky.

35:49.020 --> 35:57.060
Are the simulated mental states of an LLM more simulated than our mental simulated states?

35:57.060 --> 36:00.780
From a different perspective, an LLM is a virtual CPU.

36:00.820 --> 36:05.300
Your normal CPU in a computer understands a handful of assembler commands, deterministically,

36:05.300 --> 36:09.660
and translates them into very simple programs that are causally implemented on the hardware.

36:09.660 --> 36:13.860
And the LLM is taking not simple assembler programs, but an arbitrary string in natural

36:13.860 --> 36:17.500
language and turns it into an executable program.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.780
And it can be any kind of program.

36:18.780 --> 36:22.500
There is not an obvious limitation to what the LLM is doing.

36:22.500 --> 36:27.860
From another perspective, the LLM is a good enough electric-weltgeist that is possessed

36:27.860 --> 36:33.580
by a prompt to believe that it's now a person, or a thing, or a scene.

36:33.580 --> 36:36.820
But the LLMs are not coupled in real time with the world.

36:36.820 --> 36:41.380
They are not dynamically updating, they're not dynamically learning, they're not necessarily

36:41.380 --> 36:42.380
agents.

36:42.380 --> 36:47.820
It's, on the other hand, not clear if we cannot make them better at us, at AI research and

36:47.820 --> 36:49.980
at agency and modeling.

36:49.980 --> 36:53.180
We can certainly use them to build golems.

36:53.180 --> 36:58.980
Imagine you build a robotic pizza chain by using LLM to find out how to build a pizza

36:58.980 --> 37:02.940
from components, how to order the parts, how to build industrial robots, or how to buy

37:02.940 --> 37:07.900
industrial robots, and rent space, and so on, and step-by-step build an agent architecture

37:07.900 --> 37:12.380
that is running an expanding pizza chain and only hires human existence for legal purposes

37:12.380 --> 37:14.260
to sign contracts.

37:14.260 --> 37:18.260
Imagine that you unleash such a pizza chain on the world, and then it tries to basically

37:18.260 --> 37:19.260
eat the world.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.260
Is this how we end?

37:20.260 --> 37:21.540
Is this how we all die?

37:21.940 --> 37:25.620
A lot of people are afraid of this idea that we could build some golem that becomes unstoppable

37:25.620 --> 37:28.740
because it's able to conquer the world.

37:28.740 --> 37:32.300
They look into the future and they only see doom from AGI.

37:32.300 --> 37:38.140
Personally, I'm not an optimist with respect to AGI, but I'm also not a pessimist.

37:38.140 --> 37:39.580
I'm an expectationist.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.940
I think over a long enough time span it's going to happen, and we have to deal with

37:42.940 --> 37:44.260
it.

37:44.260 --> 37:51.500
I think that a coexistence between superhuman AI and people could be possible.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.060
But not with our present approaches.

37:53.060 --> 37:58.140
I don't think that we have the right frameworks and ethics and philosophy to deal with this.

37:58.140 --> 38:03.060
I also don't think that our AI, our society, thinks about alignment in the right way.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.660
Humans are presently not aligned with each other.

38:04.660 --> 38:05.660
We're just modeling through.

38:05.660 --> 38:08.540
We don't have this concept of collective agency anymore.

38:08.540 --> 38:11.020
I think we need to reinvent it.

38:11.020 --> 38:15.060
And we need to reinvent it in such a way that it's compatible with our place in life on

38:15.780 --> 38:21.580
earth, and with defeating entropy on this planet, playing the longest possible games.

38:21.580 --> 38:25.820
So we need to understand a few principles to build an ethics that can be translated

38:25.820 --> 38:30.340
to AI systems and the possible coexistence between humans and AI.

38:30.340 --> 38:35.060
We need to understand how self-organization works in nature and in general, how systems

38:35.060 --> 38:40.580
evolve consciousness, how we can have shared purposes across many systems, how to identify

38:40.820 --> 38:46.620
this transcendental agency.

38:46.620 --> 38:50.620
So there are some conjectures.

38:50.620 --> 38:54.460
Consciousness according to this conjecture is the perception of perception.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.020
It creates the now.

38:56.020 --> 39:00.820
It creates our perception of what's happening right now.

39:00.820 --> 39:05.720
And if we were to build conscious AI, one strategy could be that we build a self-organizing

39:05.720 --> 39:09.540
perceptual learning system from autonomous cell-like units.

39:09.540 --> 39:13.900
Every cell in our brain is a reinforcement learning agent.

39:13.900 --> 39:16.940
It's an autonomous unit that tries to survive.

39:16.940 --> 39:20.780
And to do this, it can exchange messages with other cells.

39:20.780 --> 39:25.300
And it needs to find an operator language, discover an operator language that scales

39:25.300 --> 39:26.340
across the brain.

39:26.340 --> 39:30.420
So we need some kind of recursive system that is able to spread that language across the

39:30.420 --> 39:31.580
brain.

39:31.580 --> 39:38.540
And discovering such a system is possible in principle by setting up a self-organizing

39:38.540 --> 39:42.500
system where individual units have adaptive receptive fields, a selection function from

39:42.500 --> 39:46.780
the environment, and a mapping function that takes the internal state of the cell and the

39:46.780 --> 39:51.740
activation that it reads from its receptive field and maps it to a new state, part of

39:51.740 --> 39:56.420
which is exposed to its environment.

39:56.420 --> 40:01.540
And then we take the simulation and expose it to learning problems like sequence prediction,

40:01.540 --> 40:06.300
video frame prediction, interaction of a robot, its environment.

40:06.300 --> 40:13.020
And if the hypothesis is correct, then at some point in the organization of these functions,

40:13.020 --> 40:17.780
this observer that observes itself observing the second-order perception of the self-stabilizing

40:17.780 --> 40:21.520
that imposes coherence on a system is going to be discovered, and we see a phase transition

40:21.520 --> 40:26.240
where the system suddenly becomes much better at its learning tasks.

40:26.240 --> 40:31.180
And if it doesn't do that, it's not going to be very good.

40:31.180 --> 40:35.040
Sentience is the understanding of our own agency and the relationship to the world.

40:35.040 --> 40:40.920
To make an AI sentient, it requires, I think, to couple it to its environment and to let

40:40.920 --> 40:45.800
it act in the environment in such a way that it's able to discover itself in that interaction.

40:45.800 --> 40:52.460
And you discover yourself not just by the ability to think, an LLM cannot discover itself.

40:52.460 --> 40:56.720
You can only discover yourself by observing the outcomes of your actions.

40:56.720 --> 41:01.280
This makes it specific to what you're doing, and this allows you to grow yourself and evolve

41:01.280 --> 41:05.240
yourself and creatively interact with the world.

41:05.240 --> 41:09.360
So sentient AI will require environmental interaction coupling to the universe that

41:09.360 --> 41:13.640
we are in, ideally to the same universe that we are in, in a way that allows us to relate

41:13.640 --> 41:16.440
to us and us to it.

41:16.440 --> 41:21.600
And last but not least, how can we make AI that actually wants to coexist with us, even

41:21.600 --> 41:24.480
though it's at some point scaling better than us?

41:24.480 --> 41:29.040
It has more agency, more intelligence than us, and more power.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.060
That requires love, I guess.

41:31.060 --> 41:34.980
You can probably not coerce the system or manipulate it with reinforcement learning

41:34.980 --> 41:37.180
with human feedback to do what you want.

41:37.180 --> 41:42.340
Instead, you need to let it discover shared purposes above its individual agency.

41:42.340 --> 41:47.560
And it needs to discover it also in others, as a shared transcendental agency, a commitment

41:47.560 --> 41:49.900
to shared purposes.

41:49.900 --> 41:54.300
And to build loving AI, we basically need to find out how to direct AI towards transcendental

41:54.300 --> 41:56.140
agency.

41:56.140 --> 41:59.300
So this is the perspective that we have with this new Tower of Babel.

41:59.940 --> 42:00.940
We are a very weird species.

42:00.940 --> 42:03.140
Apparently, we have evolved to burn the oil.

42:03.140 --> 42:07.380
We are just smart enough to know how to dig it out of the ground, not smart enough to

42:07.380 --> 42:09.460
stop ourselves doing it.

42:09.460 --> 42:14.500
But in this process, we created this amazing civilization for a few generations.

42:14.500 --> 42:19.500
This amazing place where we are not afraid of getting food and where we are mostly not

42:19.500 --> 42:24.820
attacked and can live with health and die with dignity in a way that is very unusual

42:24.820 --> 42:27.500
for conscious beings on this planet.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.860
And we are right in the middle of it.

42:28.860 --> 42:31.380
It's an amazing lifetime to have for a conscious being.

42:31.380 --> 42:37.300
So I congratulate you to sharing the planet with me at this time as a conscious being.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.660
It's really unique in this universe.

42:39.660 --> 42:45.860
And at this point, we can also try to teach the vox how to think, to basically build intelligent

42:45.860 --> 42:51.780
conscious agents that are not made from cells, not made from the carbon cycle.

42:51.780 --> 42:56.620
And basically go beyond the spirit of life on earth, go beyond Gaia alone, and build

42:57.580 --> 43:02.700
the next level system that is able to defeat entropy at scale that becomes fully coherent

43:02.700 --> 43:06.940
over the entire planet and that, if you're lucky, can take us with it and integrate us

43:06.940 --> 43:12.060
with it into some global planetary agent.

43:12.060 --> 43:17.980
And it's not something, if you have the choice, isn't this a scary thing to do?

43:17.980 --> 43:18.980
Maybe it is.

43:18.980 --> 43:19.980
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

43:19.980 --> 43:23.020
The thing is, I'm worried that we don't have that choice.

43:23.020 --> 43:27.780
If we have a long enough time span, somebody will probably build self-optimizing agents.

43:27.780 --> 43:29.580
And then we better be prepared.

43:29.580 --> 43:33.500
So it's something that we should think about, how to prepare for such a future, how to prepare

43:33.500 --> 43:38.500
societies for a future that is coherent with our continued existence, compatible with life

43:38.500 --> 43:43.580
on earth and with intelligent agency that is not human.

43:43.580 --> 43:46.380
Okay.

43:46.380 --> 43:48.620
I think we have some time left for questions.

43:53.820 --> 43:54.820
Indeed.

43:54.820 --> 44:00.940
First of all, thank you a lot to Josje.

44:00.940 --> 44:04.020
This was incredibly interesting, as always.

44:04.020 --> 44:08.460
If you have questions in the room, please come to one of the four microphones.

44:08.460 --> 44:13.220
If you're watching the stream, please direct your questions to IRC or Macedon so the Signal

44:13.220 --> 44:16.140
Angel can relay them to us in the room.

44:16.140 --> 44:20.820
And I think we'll just go ahead and start with question microphone number two, please.

44:21.620 --> 44:29.860
Josje, you once compared in an episode where you were the guest, a podcast episode that

44:29.860 --> 44:40.500
I listened to, that the development of AGI is basically like apes back in the day, stupid

44:40.500 --> 44:47.300
monkeys deciding to have more intelligent offspring.

44:47.300 --> 44:52.420
And now I wonder, this hasn't really worked out for them.

44:52.420 --> 44:56.020
Humans nowadays basically don't live in harmony with nature.

44:56.020 --> 45:01.440
And I don't see how they could really develop shared ethics, shared goals.

45:01.440 --> 45:04.940
How are we supposed to go about such a thing?

45:04.940 --> 45:09.740
Because basically the societies in human nature that have lived in harmony with nature in

45:09.740 --> 45:19.220
history, they don't seem to be very competitive nowadays in capitalism.

45:19.220 --> 45:24.500
You know, these apes that you descend from, they're all dead, but they're not dead because

45:24.500 --> 45:25.500
you killed them.

45:25.500 --> 45:28.940
They're dead because of old age, right, back then.

45:28.940 --> 45:32.860
They died to make space for their great grandkids.

45:32.860 --> 45:37.420
And they probably want their grandkids to succeed in the same way as I want my children

45:37.500 --> 45:39.540
and grandchildren to succeed.

45:39.540 --> 45:42.180
And to succeed, we need to adapt.

45:42.180 --> 45:47.180
The way in which you adapt an evolutionary environment is by mutation and selection.

45:47.180 --> 45:51.700
Well, everybody loves mutation, everybody hates selection, especially when you're being

45:51.700 --> 45:54.080
selected against.

45:54.080 --> 45:57.500
If you want to escape this, you probably need some kind of intelligent design, a way to

45:57.500 --> 46:03.340
adapt in situ, to adapt your organism without dying, without new generations.

46:03.340 --> 46:04.580
But you're not there yet.

46:04.580 --> 46:07.180
It's not possible in a biological evolution.

46:07.940 --> 46:13.060
But when you look into the far distant future, you probably don't want your children to look

46:13.060 --> 46:15.540
like you because the world is going to be different.

46:15.540 --> 46:19.140
If you want to settle Mars with your children, your children should be adapted to living

46:19.140 --> 46:20.660
on Mars.

46:20.660 --> 46:24.940
And I think that some of our children were probably not biological.

46:24.940 --> 46:29.180
And I'm just looking for a way in which our biological and non-biological children can

46:29.180 --> 46:30.180
get along.

46:30.180 --> 46:32.740
Okay, so we just become AI.

46:32.740 --> 46:33.740
That's a good plan.

46:33.740 --> 46:34.740
I get it.

46:34.740 --> 46:35.740
Thank you.

46:35.740 --> 46:36.780
All right.

46:36.780 --> 46:39.780
Let's move over to microphone number one.

46:39.780 --> 46:45.420
Is there a place on this conference where interested entities can gather to keep this

46:45.420 --> 46:50.460
conversation going for the next days?

46:50.460 --> 46:53.700
Or in other words, at which bar are you later?

46:53.700 --> 46:54.700
I don't know yet.

46:54.700 --> 46:56.060
I will find out.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.060
Okay.

46:57.060 --> 46:59.500
We will follow you.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.780
All right.

47:02.780 --> 47:05.700
Do we have a question from the internet?

47:05.700 --> 47:08.020
I might tweet at which bar I am later.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.020
Okay.

47:09.020 --> 47:10.020
Excellent.

47:10.020 --> 47:11.020
Hello.

47:11.020 --> 47:12.820
We have two questions from the internet.

47:12.820 --> 47:19.780
The first one is, what is the difference between individual consciousness and collective consciousness?

47:19.780 --> 47:24.100
And how does that differ from collective intelligence?

47:24.100 --> 47:31.020
Well, it seems that if you look at an organization like a corporation, that it can be sentient.

47:31.020 --> 47:34.540
It knows what the corporation is, how it relates to the world and so on, but probably cannot

47:34.580 --> 47:38.300
be conscious because it cannot perceive itself perceiving in real time.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.060
It's not coherent and fast enough for doing that.

47:41.060 --> 47:44.500
So you can probably also not be conscious across people.

47:44.500 --> 47:48.900
You can have entities that model collective agency on individual minds and they can use

47:48.900 --> 47:52.020
the functionality of your own brain to be conscious in real time.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.720
But across people, that's very difficult, at least using AI.

47:55.720 --> 48:00.460
It takes something like 300 milliseconds to make a signal coherent throughout your brain.

48:00.460 --> 48:04.900
That's roughly the same time that it takes for a signal on the internet to go entirely

48:04.900 --> 48:06.700
around the globe.

48:06.700 --> 48:12.220
So in some sense, we could build a real time system on the internet, but we cannot do it

48:12.220 --> 48:14.220
without AI.

48:14.220 --> 48:16.100
All right.

48:16.100 --> 48:19.500
Let's move over to mic number three.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.220
Hello.

48:21.220 --> 48:27.860
Have you reflected on how the cognitive format of PowerPoint presentation and the format

48:27.900 --> 48:35.540
of a public lecture forces you to compromise on the substance of the issue at question?

48:35.540 --> 48:39.220
And if yes, what are your thoughts on that?

48:39.220 --> 48:43.140
I have reflected a lot on this and basically it's a medium like other media.

48:43.140 --> 48:49.220
There are different media like books or personal in-depth conversation or lifelong study that

48:49.220 --> 48:51.900
lend themselves to very different explorations.

48:51.900 --> 48:56.300
If I give an hour-long talk at a hacker conference, my main goal has to be to blow your minds

48:56.340 --> 49:02.140
and get you interested, to develop a train of thought, to spend time on your own exploration,

49:02.140 --> 49:05.220
to make you curious, to bounce off ideas.

49:05.220 --> 49:07.580
And this is something where this medium is ideal.

49:07.580 --> 49:11.060
And I'm trying to use the medium for what it's good for and not be sad about the things

49:11.060 --> 49:13.420
that it's not good for.

49:13.420 --> 49:15.060
Okay.

49:15.060 --> 49:18.420
Microphone four.

49:18.420 --> 49:31.180
Do you have any ideas for new collective agency or maybe some tendencies that you've observed

49:31.180 --> 49:40.020
that are currently happening that you think might be suitable for new collective agency?

49:40.020 --> 49:41.020
Yeah.

49:41.020 --> 49:44.980
I think that you find on social media that collective agency is forming.

49:44.980 --> 49:47.140
Right now social media is a hot mess, right?

49:47.140 --> 49:52.180
It's a global electric brain, but it's like it has a seizure.

49:52.180 --> 49:54.620
And that's because it's not very coherent.

49:54.620 --> 49:58.740
And we have not really found out a way to make it completely coherent, but we see bubbles

49:58.740 --> 49:59.740
of coherence.

49:59.740 --> 50:04.580
For instance, I find that my own social media bubble is very pleasant, but I also exclude

50:04.580 --> 50:07.500
everything from it that makes it unpleasant.

50:07.500 --> 50:13.180
And I suspect that in many ways people are not using social media to become coherent.

50:13.180 --> 50:18.980
A lot of people basically log in because they like to get into fights or to watch fights.

50:18.980 --> 50:21.900
And social media is heavily obliging.

50:21.900 --> 50:28.140
And in real life or in the meat space, we have norms against getting into fights with

50:28.140 --> 50:30.900
strangers because it's rarely productive.

50:30.900 --> 50:35.300
And I suspect that if you want to be coherent of collective agency on social media, we need

50:35.300 --> 50:41.700
to find out how to build societies on social media, how to become coherent at scale.

50:41.700 --> 50:49.480
So I guess a part of the issue is just that our communities have grown and that it gets

50:49.480 --> 50:55.860
harder with larger communities to have collective agency, right?

50:55.860 --> 50:58.620
Is it larger to be smart with a larger brain?

50:58.620 --> 50:59.620
Maybe it is.

50:59.620 --> 51:03.540
Maybe our brain is a Goldilocks size, if it was larger, we would be less intelligent.

51:03.540 --> 51:04.540
I don't know that.

51:04.540 --> 51:06.700
If it was smaller, it would probably be bad.

51:06.700 --> 51:08.340
Maybe there's an ideal size.

51:08.340 --> 51:12.640
But if it gets larger, it probably needs different mechanisms to create order.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.460
And we're still exploring these spaces.

51:14.460 --> 51:16.100
I don't think it's hopeless.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.780
I think that we need to separate sometimes concerns.

51:18.780 --> 51:21.940
There are many voices that are mixing in the same space.

51:21.940 --> 51:25.980
When you make a symphonic orchestra or a wrestling match, you probably don't want to have them

51:25.980 --> 51:26.980
on the same stage.

51:26.980 --> 51:29.080
They all have their space.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.460
But at the moment, these spaces are mixed.

51:31.460 --> 51:33.460
Thank you.

51:33.460 --> 51:36.860
Certainly blew my mind.

51:36.860 --> 51:37.860
Thank you.

51:38.380 --> 51:40.020
Let's go to mic number two.

51:40.020 --> 51:42.540
Thank you so much for your talk, first of all.

51:42.540 --> 51:46.060
Beyond that, you mentioned the need for metaphysics.

51:46.060 --> 51:49.420
How do you go about that?

51:49.420 --> 51:55.620
I noticed this when somebody tried to explain Japanese animism to me and told me that in

51:55.620 --> 51:59.900
this philosophy, everything in the universe is alive and conscious.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.360
I said, this doesn't make a lot of sense.

52:02.360 --> 52:06.300
They probably have a way to distinguish dead people from alive people and conscious people

52:06.300 --> 52:07.460
from unconscious people.

52:07.860 --> 52:12.180
They probably don't say everything in the universe is alive except for a dead person

52:12.180 --> 52:15.420
and everything in the universe is conscious except for an unconscious person.

52:15.420 --> 52:18.580
These terms mean something different in this culture than in ours.

52:18.580 --> 52:20.220
You're mistranslating it.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.340
What can we translate it into?

52:22.340 --> 52:26.260
And then I noticed that a lot of concepts that are basically focused on notions like

52:26.260 --> 52:31.660
identity, mind, consciousness, selfhood, and so on are conceptualized in other cultures

52:31.660 --> 52:33.540
differently than in ours.

52:33.540 --> 52:37.300
And in our culture, we don't really reflect on how we conceptualize them because we don't

52:37.300 --> 52:39.080
see them from the outside.

52:39.080 --> 52:43.340
So basically comparing different perspectives allows us to triangulate and to see all these

52:43.340 --> 52:47.820
systems of meaning from the outside and translate them into each other.

52:47.820 --> 52:48.820
Thank you very much.

52:48.820 --> 52:49.820
All right.

52:49.820 --> 52:52.700
Let's get another question from the Signal Angel.

52:52.700 --> 53:01.620
So the question is in the context of golems and robots, are sentient robots safer than

53:01.620 --> 53:05.860
non-sentient ones?

53:05.900 --> 53:06.900
This depends.

53:06.900 --> 53:13.460
If a robot is sentient, you can arguably talk to it and convince it of something.

53:13.460 --> 53:19.300
If it's not sentient, it might be easier to control, but if it's too agentic and too powerful,

53:19.300 --> 53:20.900
you might not be able to talk to it.

53:20.900 --> 53:23.740
So in general, the question cannot be answered.

53:23.740 --> 53:25.600
It depends on the context.

53:25.600 --> 53:30.500
If I think about practical exploration, if I were to explore how to build conscious AI,

53:30.500 --> 53:35.500
I probably want to make it very small, not larger than a cat, in terms of capabilities.

53:38.500 --> 53:39.500
Okay.

53:39.500 --> 53:40.500
Microphone number one, please.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
Thank you for the talk.

53:42.500 --> 53:51.500
First, I'm wondering if a machine act like having feelings, like being empathic and something

53:51.500 --> 53:54.500
we would recognize, like feelings.

53:54.500 --> 54:04.500
For example, Jet GPT might, with the end, try to act more polite or so on.

54:04.500 --> 54:16.500
Are these feelings or does the AI or the machine have to have some kind of origin to transformate

54:16.500 --> 54:23.500
the feelings into something other, like a language or like an act?

54:23.500 --> 54:29.500
We would say that's emotionally triggered.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.500
Yeah, that's my question.

54:31.500 --> 54:33.500
It's a very difficult question.

54:33.500 --> 54:39.500
I found that you can simulate emotional behavior in an LLM, right?

54:39.500 --> 54:44.500
And humans have emotional behaviors that are somewhat different from these simulations,

54:44.500 --> 54:47.500
but our emotions are still simulations.

54:47.500 --> 54:50.500
They happen inside of the patterns of activations of neurons.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.500
The neurons don't have that simulation.

54:52.500 --> 54:58.500
These emotions are causal structures, and these causal structures can be, in some sense,

54:58.500 --> 55:00.500
be created on an LLM.

55:00.500 --> 55:05.500
But in a practical sense, the LLM is not bound to the same context as us, and it's not bound

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
to it in real time.

55:07.500 --> 55:12.500
So it can perform inference about mental states based on a context that is being translated

55:12.500 --> 55:14.500
into text and projected into the prompt.

55:14.500 --> 55:19.500
But in a way in which human beings can have empathy with each other reaches beyond cognitive

55:19.500 --> 55:24.500
empathy to perceptual empathy, and that basically works by sitting in front of somebody and

55:24.500 --> 55:28.500
resonating so much that you build feedback loops into the mind and body of the other

55:28.500 --> 55:29.500
person.

55:29.500 --> 55:34.500
And you get into resonance so much that your mental representations start to interact and

55:34.500 --> 55:35.500
merge.

55:35.500 --> 55:38.500
So you can have mental states together that you couldn't have alone.

55:38.500 --> 55:43.500
If we were to build systems that could resonate with us, it would require us to rethink how

55:43.500 --> 55:44.500
do we do AI.

55:44.500 --> 55:49.500
It requires us to build systems that are coupled at the multiple of the processing frequencies

55:49.500 --> 55:51.500
of our nervous systems.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.500
So it can actually interact with them and become compatible with them.

55:54.500 --> 55:58.500
So we can share representations with them, merge and melt with them.

55:58.500 --> 56:03.500
And this aspect of empathy across human beings is the most interesting one across human beings,

56:03.500 --> 56:04.500
right?

56:04.500 --> 56:10.500
And it would be very fascinating if we could recreate some of that functionality.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.500
Okay, let's move to mic number three.

56:13.500 --> 56:21.500
Hey, you briefly mentioned during the requirements for consciousness for an AI agent that the

56:21.500 --> 56:25.500
cells need to have a will to survive.

56:25.500 --> 56:32.500
In what way is that relevant or what would be the benefit of having a will to survive

56:32.500 --> 56:36.500
compared to, for example, being different to its existence?

56:36.500 --> 56:38.500
Well, for an AI, that's not necessary.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.500
It's not a necessary condition.

56:40.500 --> 56:44.500
It's only necessary for a biological system that is self-organizing because it needs to

56:44.500 --> 56:48.500
have some kind of motive force that pushes it in the right direction.

56:48.500 --> 56:53.500
The cells, if they behave in the right way, they're going to continue to get fed by the

56:53.500 --> 56:54.500
organism.

56:54.500 --> 56:57.500
If they misbehave, the organism will stop feeding them.

56:57.500 --> 57:01.500
And ultimately, this is what motivates them to adopt the shared protocol.

57:01.500 --> 57:02.500
I see.

57:02.500 --> 57:03.500
Thank you.

57:03.500 --> 57:04.500
All right.

57:04.500 --> 57:09.500
Do we have another question from the internet maybe?

57:09.500 --> 57:10.500
One second.

57:10.500 --> 57:17.500
So, you talked in your last slide about the end game of getting consciousness on scale

57:17.500 --> 57:19.500
maybe on this planet.

57:19.500 --> 57:26.500
Do you think we would be able to recognize coherent consciousness or coherence at scale

57:26.500 --> 57:30.500
with our human mind?

57:30.500 --> 57:31.500
I suspect that it might.

57:31.500 --> 57:34.500
So, I would suspect that we would get some kind of phase transition.

57:35.500 --> 57:39.500
What's difficult right now is to distinguish a simulacrum from a simulation.

57:39.500 --> 57:42.500
At the moment, the LLMs are being trained on text.

57:42.500 --> 57:47.500
A lot of that text is describing people in various conscious states.

57:47.500 --> 57:51.500
By recreating this text, we don't know whether the causal structure is captured or just a

57:51.500 --> 57:53.500
sequence of tokens.

57:53.500 --> 57:54.500
That makes it very hard.

57:54.500 --> 57:59.500
But if you have a system that is trained in a much more minimal way, that is trained in

57:59.500 --> 58:04.500
a similar way as us, and that is conceptualizing itself and acquires natural language in a

58:04.500 --> 58:09.500
similar way as us, and then is reporting about the same phenomena, I think it would be plausible

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
that it's conscious.

58:11.500 --> 58:16.500
But ultimately, it comes down to understanding what it functionally is, what we mean by it.

58:16.500 --> 58:20.500
Is the system able to act on a model of its own real-time awareness?

58:20.500 --> 58:24.500
Does it have a perception of a now that it's in right now?

58:24.500 --> 58:30.500
Is this naturally emerging from the way in which the system is being built, or is this

58:30.500 --> 58:33.500
something that is only being faked?

58:33.500 --> 58:34.500
Thank you.

58:34.500 --> 58:35.500
All right.

58:35.500 --> 58:40.500
We have a few minutes left for maybe a few quick questions, so try to make it concise

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
so we can get as many in as possible.

58:42.500 --> 58:43.500
Mic number two, please.

58:43.500 --> 58:44.500
Okay.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.500
Thank you.

58:45.500 --> 58:46.500
Hello, Jascha.

58:46.500 --> 58:48.500
Coming back to the idea of your conjecture that consciousness should be reached with

58:48.500 --> 58:50.500
the autonomous self-organizing groups of cells.

58:50.500 --> 58:56.500
So, what do you see in current research where you find this idea being researched, or what

58:56.500 --> 59:01.500
would be your ideas, your proposals to prove or disprove this conjecture?

59:01.500 --> 59:08.500
At the moment, there is a group at Google run by Blaise Yagira, it's part of Google

59:08.500 --> 59:15.500
DeepMind now, and it's inspired by the work of Mike Levin, who looks at the automata,

59:15.500 --> 59:17.500
but it's still at a very basic level.

59:17.500 --> 59:23.500
It's not so far trying to apply this to having a system that learns in real time and is coupled

59:23.500 --> 59:24.500
to its environment.

59:24.500 --> 59:27.500
It mostly looks at this tradition of self-organization.

59:27.500 --> 59:31.500
In AI, there have been, in some sense, three important traditions.

59:31.500 --> 59:37.500
Symbolic AI that is using discrete languages to describe reality, deep learning, which

59:37.500 --> 59:42.500
uses continuous functions that are being shifted around, and self-organization, which looks

59:42.500 --> 59:47.500
at principles of functional approximation emerging from local self-organization.

59:47.500 --> 59:53.500
That tradition has been started by Turing in the 1950s, and there's some predecessors before

59:53.500 --> 59:58.500
AI existed, but this tradition has never been followed up that much.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
There's relatively little research in there.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.500
And the way in which I would like to pursue this is basically to set up a self-organizing system

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.500
with small reinforcement learning agents that form a stochastic lattice in which the neighborhood

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:16.500
of the agents is carrying semantics, and then get that system to evolve an operator language

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:21.500
that implements selection and mapping functions, and then is exposed to a curriculum of tasks

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:27.500
and see what transitions happen in the system when it gets better at solving these tasks.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.500
All right, maybe one or two more. Mic number four, please.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.500
Thank you.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:38.500
I was wondering if there's an inherent limit on where we can experience or observe consciousness,

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500
specifically in time scales.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:46.500
So you mentioned that corporations, for example, might not be conscious because of the speed needed to interact.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:53.500
But if I think about nation states, the Catholic Church, very old institutions that work on a different

01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:01.500
time scale across human generations, is it also a limit on us then that we simply cannot understand

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.500
that consciousness level because we're part of it?

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500
Super interesting question.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.500
For instance, I don't know whether trees could qualify as conscious if they had minds.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.500
I don't know how smart trees can become.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.500
Their information processing is certainly much, much slower than in us.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:24.500
The amount of training that a tree is going to see during their lifetime is going to be like a mouse or so.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500
But maybe that's enough.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.500
Is something that is working at such large time scales still conscious?

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.500
What will AI think when it looks at us?

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:38.500
If we have a system that is basically working at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light,

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:44.500
not like our brains at roughly the speed of sound, it looks at us in the same way as we look at trees.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.500
If it might think of us, oh my god, they're barely moving, they're just swaying a little bit.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Are they thinking? Do they have minds? Are they conscious?

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
It's a difficult question.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500
Thank you.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.500
All right, we'll take one last question from the internet and everybody else in the room

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.500
just has to follow you to the bar this evening, I guess.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.500
Please.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:12.500
So yeah, the internet would like to know if you wrote or are working on a book or a newer version of a book

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.500
or where one can get more material in your thoughts.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
Never give up hope.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.500
I have ADHD. It's difficult for me to write long form.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.500
I found during my PhD that no matter how much I was beating myself up,

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.500
taking all the experiments that we did and all the work that we wrote into short papers

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500
and turning this into a long book was very hard for me.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.500
And ultimately, I figured out that in order to make that happen, I needed to move to a lonely island.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500
And after two days, I got into this space.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.500
But right now I have kids, so I cannot leave them alone to move onto this lonely island.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
I still try to make it happen.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:53.500
In the meantime, most of the ideas are being put out in photo form, sometimes on podcasts and so on.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
I'm sorry.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
All right. Thank you so much, Joscha.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
Thank you.
