and then I'm going to add a little bit of salt and pepper, and then I'm going to add a little bit of salt and pepper, and then I can already hear the music...

04:15.540 --> 04:18.540
We're going to turn off the song, sleepy, and then we're off...

04:48.540 --> 04:55.540
You know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,

05:19.540 --> 05:26.540
you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,

05:32.540 --> 05:39.540
you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,

you know what, you know what, you know what.

06:18.540 --> 06:25.540
You know what, you know what, you know what.

08:18.540 --> 08:31.540
So, I'll explain it to you. I sat at the computer earlier, played a bit, the girls were out

08:31.540 --> 08:36.540
and the woman called and said, should I buy you beer? We are just shopping. I'll bring you

08:36.540 --> 08:42.540
beer. Tell me which beer. And it turned out that we were grilling. So I thought, cool,

08:42.540 --> 08:47.540
we're grilling. But that means I'm drinking beer and that means I won't play after that

08:47.540 --> 08:52.540
because if I'm drunk or just drunk, I can't play anymore. I'm taking it seriously.

08:52.540 --> 08:57.540
I have a delay, then I can't react anymore and that's why I can't do it. So I thought,

08:57.540 --> 09:02.540
I'll look at the debate battle at the competition anyway and I'll drink a beer anyway

09:02.540 --> 09:07.540
because we're grilling. And I did this on the beamer in the living room. That means my wife

09:07.540 --> 09:12.540
pulled it in and so on. Super funny. And then I thought, fuck it, do a live stream.

09:12.540 --> 09:19.540
And I always wanted to do something quick anyway, like a few capitalism films

09:19.540 --> 09:24.540
that are running under the radar that no one knows. First thing, in the video description

09:24.540 --> 09:29.540
you have to find a link to a movie pilot list. If you can't see it, then you have to

09:29.540 --> 09:36.540
make a fun account. Make yourself a fun account or log in with some junk,

09:36.540 --> 09:42.540
with some social media. It should work. Then you can see the list. And I just

09:42.540 --> 09:46.540
clicked them together. That means I will certainly have forgotten films that are super nice.

09:46.540 --> 09:51.540
And if you can think of good films that talk about capitalism, and it's not especially

09:51.540 --> 09:55.540
films like The Big Short that are obvious or Wolf of Wall Street, where that is completely clear,

09:55.540 --> 09:58.540
but films where it may not be completely clear that they talk about capitalism.

09:58.540 --> 10:03.540
These films are especially interesting. And yes, I have now prepared the list

10:03.540 --> 10:08.540
and we'll just go through it. And as I said, if you come up with something, just write it

10:08.540 --> 10:16.540
in the comments. The chat is now there. So, and before it starts, terms like capitalism

10:16.540 --> 10:21.540
are bubbles on a string. The string is the well-known red thread. Such definitions

10:21.540 --> 10:32.540
I see. You're in a good mood today. You have a beer, you have a spade, and that's why

10:32.540 --> 10:36.540
you're making really clever speeches here. I notice that. Okay, no problem. I'll start.

10:36.540 --> 10:41.540
I think I've talked about Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt before. The film is really

10:41.540 --> 10:47.540
wonderful, because the film is actually the perfect thing, in my opinion, about the films

10:47.540 --> 10:53.540
that I actually want to talk about here. The film was sold back then as a mafia film.

10:53.540 --> 10:59.540
He also only had the actors, for example the guys from the Sopranos. He had these typical

10:59.540 --> 11:05.540
mobster mafia situations. And so was the trailer and so was the poster. So the film was

11:05.540 --> 11:10.540
marketed. And everyone went into the movies and then expected a mafia film. And it was

11:10.540 --> 11:15.540
not a classic mafia film. Everyone was already pissed off and the film also got super

11:15.540 --> 11:20.540
bad reviews because everyone was just disappointed. And I'll tell you, I didn't know

11:20.540 --> 11:25.540
the film and I didn't notice the advertising back then. I only saw it a few months ago.

11:25.540 --> 11:30.540
And I was totally surprised. First of all, the film is also produced by Wood Pitt and

11:30.540 --> 11:38.540
the film is about capitalism. So this setting, this mafia setting that is

11:38.540 --> 11:44.540
embodied there, that's just a make-up artist. That's just a marketing strategy for the

11:44.540 --> 11:50.540
film. But on the other hand, it's an extremely good metaphor. It's about capitalism.

11:50.540 --> 11:56.540
And the nice thing is, Brad Pitt himself plays the main role and he embodies capitalism.

11:56.540 --> 12:02.540
He embodies, in my opinion, all contradictions of capitalism. He has them in him.

12:02.540 --> 12:06.540
So first of all, it's of course Brad Pitt. He looks super cool, he runs around, he's super

12:06.540 --> 12:11.540
clean, he talks all the time and so on. And he just does it as if he were really serious.

12:11.540 --> 12:16.540
And he just wants to, so he's an order killer and he just does his business with killing.

12:16.540 --> 12:20.540
And that's not a problem at all. Morality doesn't play a role in the film at all.

12:20.540 --> 12:25.540
That's really cool. That's what it's about, not at all. But he is constantly

12:25.540 --> 12:31.540
confronted with the fact that his business also leads to things that

12:31.540 --> 12:36.540
piss him off. And that's just funny. And the film is really just elegant and

12:36.540 --> 12:41.540
very nicely done. Especially the first scenes are really dirty and you can see

12:41.540 --> 12:47.540
how it is when you stand in the bottom of the pyramid in the USA. There is no solidarity.

12:47.540 --> 12:53.540
Natural Born Chaos, yes. Very good idea. I'll add it right away.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.540
If my wife was in the chat now, she would have said that a long time ago.

13:03.540 --> 13:08.540
This is my wife's favorite film. In any case, a really good film because he

13:08.540 --> 13:13.540
refers really well to how it is with the media and with the feedback loops.

13:13.540 --> 13:18.540
And above all, he is already so old and yet the film is still completely accurate.

13:18.540 --> 13:22.540
So, Killings in Softly. And that's for example the guy from the Sopranos.

13:22.540 --> 13:27.540
He plays an aging order killer and he should do the job. And he should do the job

13:27.540 --> 13:31.540
only because he wants to kill someone because Brad Pitt doesn't want to do it himself.

13:31.540 --> 13:35.540
He somehow knows the victim so half and he actually didn't want to be pulled in

13:35.540 --> 13:40.540
and that's just too emotional. And he would rather do an alienated business where

13:40.540 --> 13:45.540
he is far away from the content. He doesn't want to argue about content. He just wants

13:45.540 --> 13:50.540
to make a business decision. And then he gets a Sopranos man and he is

13:50.540 --> 13:53.540
already completely over the mountain. So he doesn't want to do his job anymore.

13:53.540 --> 13:56.540
He doesn't want to do anything anymore. He is completely alienated from the world.

13:56.540 --> 14:00.540
He actually just wants to use alcohol. And that is no longer fun for him.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.540
And he meets him in a hotel lobby and he is already badly reprimanded because the guy is

14:04.540 --> 14:08.540
so fat and old and shit and he doesn't want to do it anymore and he is just drunk.

14:08.540 --> 14:13.540
And Brad Pitt tries to get him to do the job and in the end he doesn't do it.

14:13.540 --> 14:18.540
And then Brad Pitt has to do it himself and all that. And that's all totally awesome.

14:18.540 --> 14:23.540
Super nice. And the best thing about the film. So first of all, this whole mess,

14:23.540 --> 14:28.540
how it gets there. The actors are great. The whole excessive violence that is

14:28.540 --> 14:33.540
shown in the film. It is really not fetishizing at all.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.540
It is not like you would expect in a normal gangster movie.

14:37.540 --> 14:42.540
Really masculine, really cool scenes where someone shoots you in the head with a

14:42.540 --> 14:46.540
gun or something. Or where someone beats you up really hard. Yes, there is that.

14:46.540 --> 14:51.540
But they are shown the way they are. Just raw and bloody.

14:51.540 --> 14:56.540
I am actually used to raw violence in films and bloody films.

14:56.540 --> 15:01.540
Nevertheless, I had this feeling when watching the film that this is just not an

15:01.540 --> 15:06.540
aesthetic scene. It is just disgusting. It just resists you because the violence is

15:06.540 --> 15:11.540
shown so realistically. And you really think, oh, does that have to be now?

15:11.540 --> 15:16.540
Do they have to do that now? That's shit. And so on and so on.

15:16.540 --> 15:21.540
And believe me, I have already seen a lot of films. It is not that I am

15:21.540 --> 15:26.540
somehow surrounded by violence and that is why I am not good at it.

15:26.540 --> 15:31.540
And that is wonderful. And of course all the actors are great.

15:31.540 --> 15:36.540
And also all the little characters that are in it.

15:36.540 --> 15:41.540
In my opinion, this is also a metaphor for the hype on the market place.

15:42.540 --> 15:47.540
There are many small actors and that doesn't matter at all.

15:47.540 --> 15:50.540
They will be irrelevant at some point. All the stories of the actors don't matter at some point.

15:50.540 --> 15:54.540
At some point it's just about Brad Pitt and his business and whether he ends the quest

15:54.540 --> 15:59.540
properly or not. And at the end of the film, that is really the best, the end,

15:59.540 --> 16:04.540
the last 2-3 minutes, he is sitting there with the guy with whom he shot the deal

16:04.540 --> 16:09.540
and so on. He was supposed to finish the job.

16:09.540 --> 16:14.540
And somehow he gets less money. He gets beaten up for the money.

16:14.540 --> 16:19.540
And in the background, Obama is running because there is a election campaign.

16:19.540 --> 16:24.540
We are a big nation, we are a community, we all belong together. Come together, people.

16:24.540 --> 16:29.540
And Brad Pitt doesn't have to come out at all and laugh how ridiculous that is.

16:29.540 --> 16:34.540
Because he says, no, wait a minute, the USA is not a country. We are not a community.

16:34.540 --> 16:39.540
Everyone has his own business. And besides, where is my money, you asshole?

16:39.540 --> 16:43.540
And it's just a wonderful situation. I've said that before. The film is really fantastic.

16:43.540 --> 16:48.540
And I think such films are great. He made fun of the people who watch the film,

16:48.540 --> 16:53.540
as it is part of marketing, i.e. with capitalist methods,

16:53.540 --> 16:57.540
to go to the cinema and watch the film about capitalism.

16:57.540 --> 17:01.540
Of course, everyone was pissed off afterwards. I think it's wonderful. I can really imagine

17:02.540 --> 17:07.540
And yes, all these metaphors in the film.

17:07.540 --> 17:12.540
Then these drug addicts at the beginning, the mafia boys with the money and so on.

17:12.540 --> 17:17.540
And then in the end the wrong one is knocked out. And that's just great.

17:17.540 --> 17:22.540
It's a great film. So, next film.

17:22.540 --> 17:27.540
The next film on my list. In German it's called The Black Diamond.

17:27.540 --> 17:32.540
I don't know, I didn't even know that it's called that.

17:32.540 --> 17:37.540
I think I looked it up in German. It's called Uncut Gems in English.

17:37.540 --> 17:42.540
So, unpolished diamonds, one might translate that.

17:42.540 --> 17:47.540
The film is first of all great because it's with Adam Sandler.

17:47.540 --> 17:52.540
And Adam Sandler, you know, that's the guy who always makes these nonsense films.

17:52.540 --> 17:57.540
These normal mainstream comedies, nonsense films.

17:57.540 --> 18:02.540
And in this film, which is a highly serious film, he plays a guy

18:02.540 --> 18:07.540
in the diamond Jewish quarter, where all the other diamond Jews are sitting around

18:07.540 --> 18:12.540
in their weird diamond boots and peeing at each other with the stones and so on.

18:12.540 --> 18:17.540
And I think the film starts with an African from a mine knocking out a fat clunker.

18:18.540 --> 18:23.540
That's how the film starts. So that you can briefly see the misery,

18:23.540 --> 18:28.540
from which misery layer everything is made. And then it's just about how

18:28.540 --> 18:33.540
Adam Sandler tries to tick this fat clunker. And the whole film turns around like this.

18:33.540 --> 18:38.540
And Adam Sandler is just a wheel in the gear. It becomes completely clear in the film

18:38.540 --> 18:43.540
that he is of course not a profiteur of the system. Even if he sells the stone and everything is clean.

18:43.540 --> 18:48.540
He is a profiteur. He has an infinite amount of stress in the film. It makes him completely finished.

18:48.540 --> 18:53.540
He also probably has debts somewhere else. And it's all semi-legal.

18:53.540 --> 18:58.540
Then he has some mafia boys who want to finish him. And he has this diamond shop

18:58.540 --> 19:03.540
and that's so cool. And then he somehow has a wife, then he has an affair and so on.

19:03.540 --> 19:08.540
Then it all goes down the drain. He is always stressed. His phone is constantly ringing.

19:08.540 --> 19:13.540
And the whole setting is so that you as a viewer are permanently really tense.

19:13.540 --> 19:18.540
You really feel the burnout. You feel the burnout of Adam Sandler.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.540
And Adam Sandler in the film is also shown so cool. Because he is already so old.

19:22.540 --> 19:26.540
You can do that really well. He already looks so finished.

19:26.540 --> 19:31.540
And then you have the camera perspectives and close-ups of the faces.

19:31.540 --> 19:35.540
Really intense shots where people are just shown in their ugliness.

19:35.540 --> 19:40.540
That's great. And that's what makes the film so a little bit for me.

19:40.540 --> 19:46.540
This ruckus camera, this stress, the burnout. All that just to somehow earn money.

19:46.540 --> 19:51.540
What the people actually do, at least he, he is also half a player.

19:51.540 --> 19:55.540
He does sports betting and so on. He is of course completely alienated.

19:55.540 --> 20:01.540
What he actually wants is somehow money so that he can buy something with his money.

20:01.540 --> 20:06.540
That's actually the tenor.

20:06.540 --> 20:11.540
The film just completely rots out. It escalates in a certain direction.

20:11.540 --> 20:16.540
And everything is always about this stone.

20:16.540 --> 20:20.540
I would go so far and say this is a typical, this is a real masterpiece.

20:20.540 --> 20:26.540
It's like Killing Them Softly in my opinion. A real masterpiece in terms of a capitalism film.

20:26.540 --> 20:31.540
It's not like The Big Short or other films like Wall Street.

20:31.540 --> 20:36.540
Where it is clear that this is completely clear that this is about capitalism and how stupid it is now.

20:36.540 --> 20:41.540
I think clear films like that are also great. They are just on the list here because they are part of it.

20:41.540 --> 20:46.540
But Uncut Gems is a film that is really really premium.

20:46.540 --> 20:51.540
And I can only recommend it to you if you don't know it.

20:51.540 --> 20:56.540
I have the impression that such films, although they are with such fat actors, do not come into the mainstream.

20:56.540 --> 21:01.540
Because they just treat serious topics and the audience does not want that.

21:01.540 --> 21:06.540
Because of casualization. There are only Avengers and some strange family films.

21:06.540 --> 21:11.540
They are in the mainstream because they create positive vibes.

21:11.540 --> 21:16.540
And that is exactly what people need in times of crisis.

21:16.540 --> 21:21.540
People watch so many films that they break down.

21:21.540 --> 21:26.540
And if you don't have the mental capacity and you just look at something like that all the time, then you go crazy.

21:26.540 --> 21:31.540
Just because you are not aware of your own empathy.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.540
I have the feeling that there must not be a perfect political system.

21:36.540 --> 21:41.540
Because all political currents live from friction and crumbling.

21:42.540 --> 21:51.540
If you think with a perfect political system that it is a system where the debates do not exist.

21:51.540 --> 21:56.540
Or where everyone is always in agreement, where there are no conflicts.

21:59.540 --> 22:04.540
I could imagine that it is a bit like the perfect free market.

22:04.540 --> 22:09.540
Where all information is there and all actors make perfect rational decisions.

22:09.540 --> 22:14.540
Then there is no profit in the system anymore.

22:14.540 --> 22:19.540
I have looked up this article from Investopedia.

22:19.540 --> 22:24.540
The perfect free market, the perfect competition, does not generate any profit anymore.

22:24.540 --> 22:29.540
And maybe that's what you mean, the perfect political system.

22:29.540 --> 22:34.540
As long as it contains people, I don't think it exists.

22:34.540 --> 22:39.540
The inherent human contradictions reflect in our society again.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.540
On a higher level we get them all turned in again.

22:44.540 --> 22:49.540
And be it prejudices and racism, that's enough.

22:49.540 --> 22:54.540
But of course there are many other things that play into it.

22:54.540 --> 22:59.540
That's why I say, because the problem is that there is no perfect political system.

22:59.540 --> 23:05.540
The optimal solution would be the absolute crumbling of all hierarchies.

23:05.540 --> 23:11.540
Maybe not maximum, but extremely strong decentralization.

23:11.540 --> 23:22.540
It could be that there are groups of 50 people who can establish themselves in a kind of debate culture that can function stably.

23:23.540 --> 23:31.540
Because even if one of them goes out with the neighbor's wife and the other husband is angry, they might not give up.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.540
Then you can somehow solve it.

23:34.540 --> 23:45.540
This is also observed in many Swedish films, where people realize that such problems are not so strong if there is enough mental capacity in people.

23:45.540 --> 23:49.540
All these inter-men problems that may also shake up.

23:49.540 --> 23:55.540
If you have hierarchies, if one is the boss of a big company and has hatred for someone,

23:55.540 --> 24:02.540
that he tries to use his power, which he exposes only to destroy someone who has only slept with his wife,

24:02.540 --> 24:07.540
which has nothing to do with the business or the power itself and should actually be irrelevant to the hierarchies.

24:07.540 --> 24:15.540
But that will be done by the fact that our human flaws are transferred to it.

24:15.540 --> 24:17.540
Such a thing would also be possible.

24:17.540 --> 24:22.540
But such a thing is small because of decentralization, because one does not give so much power to individual people.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.540
Then one would automatically solve it.

24:28.540 --> 24:31.540
Yes, people are not perfect, so no systems, I would say.

24:31.540 --> 24:33.540
Yes, that is definitely the case.

24:33.540 --> 24:40.540
You can really compare it with stable systems.

24:40.540 --> 24:47.540
In physics, one talks about stable systems when small deviations do not change the state of balance.

24:47.540 --> 24:50.540
A classic example is cycling.

24:50.540 --> 24:54.540
Cycling only works because of rotation.

24:54.540 --> 25:01.540
Rotation creates, so to speak, the wheels turn, they have a rotation and that is a constant with respect to the fixed star.

25:01.540 --> 25:06.540
Of course, friction takes a little bit away, but that means that when you drive and there is a small deviation,

25:06.540 --> 25:10.540
for example, I steer a little bit like this or I wobble around a bit, then I roll and then I keep tilting back,

25:10.540 --> 25:15.540
then I tilt back, because that is also the case with a circle, in the state of balance.

25:15.540 --> 25:18.540
Against small deviations, it is stable.

25:18.540 --> 25:23.540
If, of course, one of the sides gives you a drop, then you fall off the bike and then the wheel turns, of course.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.540
But for small deviations it is good.

25:25.540 --> 25:31.540
So, and now you have to ask yourself systematically, how do you get the small deviations?

25:31.540 --> 25:37.540
Well, if you do not start a world war, but only once the neighbor's wife has birded, then it is a small deviation.

25:37.540 --> 25:39.540
But that can not make a world war easier.

25:39.540 --> 25:43.540
If you now bird the wife of Putin, then maybe.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.540
But the problem is, only Putin is so powerful.

25:45.540 --> 25:52.540
So if you have small decentralized organs, where, so to speak, the power cannot be organized in big hierarchies,

25:52.540 --> 25:56.540
then you can only generate small deviations with these human errors,

25:56.540 --> 26:02.540
which then, possibly, by the community, which then knows and acts relatively familiarly,

26:02.540 --> 26:08.540
because everyone is connected with everyone, not so alienated and anonymous as now, for example, here,

26:08.540 --> 26:11.540
in a big city, in a normal big city, where you do not even know your neighbors,

26:11.540 --> 26:13.540
then something like that works.

26:13.540 --> 26:19.540
And if you have small hierarchies, with small communities, where everything is somehow debatable,

26:19.540 --> 26:21.540
then it is somehow more conceivable.

26:21.540 --> 26:25.540
And then, so to speak, the question is, how do you solve this with the big problems?

26:25.540 --> 26:29.540
Well, with real networking and transparency.

26:29.540 --> 26:35.540
So you have to strive for a transparent global networking,

26:35.540 --> 26:40.540
in which something similar like a democracy can be nurtured with debate culture.

26:40.540 --> 26:43.540
But that is definitely future music.

26:43.540 --> 26:49.540
The basic requirement would be that you have enough mature citizens.

26:49.540 --> 26:52.540
So not like now, but really many.

26:52.540 --> 26:56.540
Over 50% should already be people who, so to speak, come to terms with it

26:56.540 --> 27:00.540
and at least recognize how the world works.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.540
Social engineering.

27:12.540 --> 27:17.540
Digitalized humanity.

27:17.540 --> 27:23.540
The thing is, I'm doing this video series about digitalization now,

27:23.540 --> 27:30.540
and I don't know what's next, but I'm going to make a video about blockchain at some point.

27:30.540 --> 27:36.540
Because blockchain, so to speak, is an academic aspect,

27:36.540 --> 27:39.540
although very academic, but a relatively positive aspect.

27:39.540 --> 27:44.540
And I think that these things bring all these positive vibes because of what digitalization could do.

27:44.540 --> 27:47.540
It could, for example, pick up all the monopolistic structures.

27:47.540 --> 27:53.540
Because that is exactly what automated, decentralized trust creates, a transparent environment.

27:53.540 --> 27:56.540
Of course, it has many disadvantages, for example, energy consumption.

27:56.540 --> 28:00.540
But the idea is not bad at first, and you can definitely do a lot of things from it.

28:00.540 --> 28:04.540
The thing is, I'm just drawing up a lecture on cryptography,

28:04.540 --> 28:10.540
just because I never really managed to draw it up,

28:10.540 --> 28:14.540
because of how it works in real life, for example with random generators.

28:14.540 --> 28:18.540
I once had a lecture on algorithms in physics or something.

28:18.540 --> 28:23.540
It was mainly about C-programming of such numerical problems.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.540
But something like that was also addressed.

28:25.540 --> 28:28.540
The thing is, when the random generator was made with us,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.540
there are different qualities of random generators.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.540
In essence, they all repeat themselves at some point.

28:32.540 --> 28:36.540
That means you have to sort out the system somehow.

28:36.540 --> 28:40.540
I missed that. I don't know, I was on vacation or something when the lecture was on.

28:40.540 --> 28:43.540
That means, because I didn't understand it in detail,

28:43.540 --> 28:45.540
I'm drawing up a lecture on cryptography now,

28:45.540 --> 28:50.540
and then I want to draw up a lecture on, I don't know, higher data structures,

28:50.540 --> 28:53.540
to really understand how that works.

28:53.540 --> 28:59.540
Of course, I understand schematically how that works with the blockchain.

28:59.540 --> 29:02.540
That's clear. But that's not enough for me.

29:02.540 --> 29:05.540
I want the details so that I know what I'm talking about.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.540
That's always the way it is.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.540
I want to establish this habitus.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.540
Of course, that takes time, but I have the time.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.540
I have the privilege to draw it up.

29:13.540 --> 29:17.540
I like to draw up 13 lectures, 90 minutes each.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.540
Just one every day or something.

29:19.540 --> 29:22.540
At some point I got it. At some point I understood it.

29:22.540 --> 29:25.540
That will definitely come, but I don't know when yet.

29:25.540 --> 29:28.540
But this digitalization series is going to be quite lengthy.

29:28.540 --> 29:31.540
I guess 5, 6, 7, 8 videos will already be published.

29:31.540 --> 29:35.540
But I'm also doing other things on the side, so I don't know exactly when.

29:41.540 --> 29:45.540
Then let's look further into my list.

29:46.540 --> 29:49.540
So, apart from Uncut Gems,

29:49.540 --> 29:53.540
the next film I've seen is the film Good Time.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.540
It's by the same filmmaker.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.540
It's the film before that.

29:58.540 --> 30:01.540
It's also pretty cool.

30:01.540 --> 30:06.540
It has the same thing with the camera and these ugly people in the close-up.

30:06.540 --> 30:13.540
But the story is a bit more brutal.

30:14.540 --> 30:22.540
Uncut Gems has shown the snowball system on the level of the people we would call privileged.

30:22.540 --> 30:29.540
People who have enough income to have a house, an affair, a sports car and so on.

30:29.540 --> 30:33.540
And Good Time shows the difference in the USA.

30:33.540 --> 30:41.540
People who are so poor that they don't know where to get their food next week.

30:42.540 --> 30:51.540
The film is pretty cool because it starts with a guy in a psychological treatment.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.540
Psychotherapy or something like that.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.540
He's talking to someone.

30:55.540 --> 30:58.540
He obviously has a tube test and so on.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.540
And the guy is a bit stupid, you can already see that.

31:00.540 --> 31:04.540
He just looks like that and gives some weird answers.

31:04.540 --> 31:10.540
And suddenly the stupid vampire guy, Robert Pattinson, comes in.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.540
He looks really bad in the film, that's great.

31:13.540 --> 31:17.540
And he says, fuck off you fucking therapist, I'll take my brother with me.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.540
I'll save him from this misery.

31:19.540 --> 31:20.540
I'll take him with me.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.540
And that's how the film starts.

31:22.540 --> 31:29.540
And it turns out that Robert Pattinson, by the way, only makes cool films since he stopped this joke with the vampire.

31:29.540 --> 31:33.540
He made a name for himself with the vampire and now he makes cool films.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.540
And that's the best I've seen so far.

31:36.540 --> 31:39.540
But I've seen a few others that aren't bad either.

31:39.540 --> 31:42.540
And he's the big brother of this guy who's a bit mental.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.540
He's a bit stupid.

31:44.540 --> 31:47.540
And they're both poor pigs.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.540
And what's his plan?

31:49.540 --> 31:54.540
Well, his plan is that he'll transfer a bank with his brother and then he'll fly to Mexico.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.540
That's the plan.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.540
And what do they do?

31:58.540 --> 32:01.540
They somehow have scars and they have masks.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.540
And they dress up as black.

32:03.540 --> 32:09.540
That's funny because it's a bit like the structural racism in the states.

32:09.540 --> 32:12.540
Later he's in a prison cell where only black people are sitting around.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.540
That's funny anyway.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.540
So they transfer a bank.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.540
Then they run away with the money.

32:17.540 --> 32:20.540
Then everything goes wrong.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.540
I think they lose themselves somehow.

32:22.540 --> 32:23.540
How was that?

32:23.540 --> 32:28.540
I think the brother, because he's a bit stupid, gets caught by the bulls.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.540
Robert Pattinson escapes with the money.

32:31.540 --> 32:35.540
And then, I think, he has to wash the money.

32:35.540 --> 32:37.540
And he has a lot of problems.

32:37.540 --> 32:43.540
The funny thing is, Robert Pattinson is the only character in the whole movie who's clever.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.540
You notice that.

32:44.540 --> 32:50.540
He has problems, thinks of something and finds a relatively good solution.

32:50.540 --> 32:55.540
He has the same burnout mentality as Adam Sandler in the other movie.

32:55.540 --> 32:59.540
Or you can compare it with Jack Bauer in 24.

32:59.540 --> 33:02.540
24 starts, then a problem pops up.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.540
Then three more problems pop up.

33:04.540 --> 33:07.540
At some point he has 1,000 tabs open with 1,000 problems.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.540
And he has to solve them all within 24 hours.

33:09.540 --> 33:11.540
That's the way it is.

33:11.540 --> 33:15.540
And there are unpredictable things for Robert Pattinson.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.540
And he gets them somehow.

33:18.540 --> 33:19.540
He tricks people.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.540
He just talks them to death.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.540
So he has found a method.

33:22.540 --> 33:23.540
The people are so stupid.

33:23.540 --> 33:25.540
He just needs to talk to them, talk to them, talk to them.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.540
So really stupid from the side.

33:26.540 --> 33:29.540
Until they just give up and say, yes, you're right or something.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.540
And you notice that.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.540
And the kind of dialogues that are introduced in the movie.

33:32.540 --> 33:38.540
That's how I actually imagine the normal, uneducated difference in the United States.

33:38.540 --> 33:41.540
They really only talk about such idiotic things.

33:42.540 --> 33:44.540
By the way, Idiocacy is actually a great movie, too.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.540
It definitely has to be included here.

33:50.540 --> 33:54.540
And yes, that's definitely the case with the film.

33:54.540 --> 33:57.540
You notice that right away.

33:57.540 --> 34:00.540
And you think all the time, that can't be.

34:00.540 --> 34:04.540
The actions sometimes seem so strange to you.

34:04.540 --> 34:07.540
But that's just because you're completely different.

34:08.540 --> 34:12.540
The situation is evaluated as the people who are represented there.

34:12.540 --> 34:15.540
And to get back to the thing with the racism.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.540
It's super funny.

34:16.540 --> 34:20.540
They're in a amusement park in the meantime.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.540
I think they want to somehow.

34:23.540 --> 34:24.540
What do they actually want?

34:24.540 --> 34:27.540
I think either they want to hide the coal or they want to get the coal.

34:27.540 --> 34:28.540
I don't know anymore.

34:28.540 --> 34:30.540
In any case, they break in there.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.540
And then there are security guys.

34:33.540 --> 34:35.540
And they have to box them over.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.540
And he's black.

34:36.540 --> 34:40.540
And then they steal the clothes and dress themselves as security boys.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.540
And then the real bulls come later.

34:42.540 --> 34:47.540
And they just clearly assume that the black one has to be the criminal.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.540
And that's not being spoken out.

34:49.540 --> 34:51.540
It's like killing in the soft.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.540
It's not being spoken out.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.540
It's just a cool situation.

34:55.540 --> 34:58.540
And you think that's an interesting situation.

34:58.540 --> 35:01.540
And you think that's an interesting situation.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.540
Something like that is being watched out for.

35:03.540 --> 35:09.540
Because of course capitalism and inequality and structural exploitation hierarchies,

35:09.540 --> 35:13.540
such as racism or patriarchy or things like that,

35:13.540 --> 35:21.540
they plant themselves very well in almost feudal structures

35:21.540 --> 35:23.540
that we have in capitalism.

35:23.540 --> 35:28.540
And that goes very well with our tradition and where the money is and the snowball system and so on.

35:28.540 --> 35:34.540
And another cool situation is, I think in the film it was like this.

35:34.540 --> 35:38.540
He wants to get his brother out of the hospital.

35:38.540 --> 35:40.540
And he's being watched out for bulls.

35:40.540 --> 35:43.540
Then he has to trick the bulls to get his brother out.

35:43.540 --> 35:46.540
But then he finds out that he's on the wrong bed.

35:46.540 --> 35:52.540
Because his brother was completely crushed by the blacks in the jail.

35:52.540 --> 35:55.540
And he has a face that is completely covered with bandages.

35:55.540 --> 35:57.540
And he doesn't know what he looks like.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.540
And then he seems to be standing in front of the wrong bed

35:59.540 --> 36:01.540
from another guy who was also completely crushed.

36:01.540 --> 36:03.540
He takes him out, throws him in his car,

36:03.540 --> 36:05.540
and then finds out that he's the wrong guy.

36:05.540 --> 36:06.540
With him he runs around.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.540
And the guy tells a story.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.540
He tells a story about how it happened

36:10.540 --> 36:14.540
that he is being watched out for bulls again and has to go to jail again and so on.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.540
And then it's probably like this.

36:16.540 --> 36:19.540
He came out of the jail and of course has no perspective.

36:19.540 --> 36:21.540
Because you have to imagine, if you were in jail in the states,

36:21.540 --> 36:23.540
then you're done for.

36:23.540 --> 36:28.540
Then you can hardly get back into society.

36:28.540 --> 36:30.540
First of all, you're burned.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.540
But on the other hand, you don't have any credibility.

36:32.540 --> 36:34.540
You don't have any credit worth.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.540
You don't get an apartment and things like that.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.540
Of course, you don't get a job if you don't have an apartment.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.540
It all comes down to that.

36:40.540 --> 36:42.540
So when you're poor, it gets more and more difficult in the USA.

36:42.540 --> 36:46.540
Because there are very few solidarity structures at all

36:47.540 --> 36:49.540
to catch these people.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.540
And of course, they slip even further.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.540
Either they become criminals again

36:53.540 --> 36:55.540
or they rot or they are homeless

36:55.540 --> 36:57.540
and then they become criminals again.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.540
With little things and so on.

36:59.540 --> 37:01.540
But that is shown in the film cool.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.540
And the joke is, Robert Pattinson is freeing him now.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.540
Unintentionally from the hospital.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.540
And the guy wakes up and notices that

37:08.540 --> 37:10.540
and says, shit, now I'm fucked.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.540
I can't, I'm as good as in prison.

37:13.540 --> 37:15.540
I'm out on bail.

37:15.540 --> 37:17.540
And that you got me out of here, I can't tell anyone.

37:17.540 --> 37:19.540
I'm fucked.

37:19.540 --> 37:21.540
I can do whatever I want.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.540
So that's his logical conclusion.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.540
And that's why they go to this park.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.540
I have a drug hiding place in the park.

37:27.540 --> 37:29.540
With a bunch of drugs.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.540
We can tick them, then we're rich.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.540
And then we go to Mexico.

37:33.540 --> 37:35.540
That was the logic.

37:35.540 --> 37:37.540
And he helps him to find the treasure.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.540
And that's a super funny quest.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.540
The whole film goes like this.

37:41.540 --> 37:43.540
And it's also from the stress level.

37:43.540 --> 37:45.540
Just like Uncut Gems.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.540
That you're always under stress.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.540
And the film ends with Robert Pattinson.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.540
How he gets arrested.

37:51.540 --> 37:53.540
And sits in a police car.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.540
And he looks into the camera for a minute.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.540
And there's no music anymore.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.540
He just looks.

37:59.540 --> 38:01.540
And as a viewer you let everything go.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.540
What happened in the last few minutes.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.540
In the last hour of the film.

38:05.540 --> 38:07.540
What he just experienced.

38:07.540 --> 38:09.540
What he tried to solve.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.540
What problems he solved.

38:11.540 --> 38:13.540
And how he collapses in the end.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.540
And how unresolvable it is for him.

38:15.540 --> 38:17.540
It seems to him that he can't get out of this.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.540
It's possible for him.

38:19.540 --> 38:21.540
This perspective.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.540
It's portrayed really well in the film.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.540
And that's why I think it's a great film about capitalism.

38:27.540 --> 38:29.540
Because that's how it looks.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.540
Especially for the people who are in these situations.

38:31.540 --> 38:33.540
Who are depicted there.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.540
In my opinion absolutely realistic films.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.540
Which are also portrayed so well.

38:37.540 --> 38:39.540
In between there is also this story.

38:39.540 --> 38:41.540
That a 15 year old is seduced.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.540
Just to stay longer in the apartment.

38:43.540 --> 38:45.540
There is also a lot of borderline stuff.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.540
And it's all so dirty and dirty.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.540
And so shit is depicted.

38:49.540 --> 38:51.540
But just as it is.

38:51.540 --> 38:53.540
I think that's important.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.540
Films that just

38:55.540 --> 38:57.540
The disgusting sides.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.540
Of our civilization.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.540
To the viewer in the face.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.540
And say look at this.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.540
Look at this shit again.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.540
It's so similar.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.540
I really like this film.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.540
This french film.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.540
Cuties.

39:13.540 --> 39:15.540
Or so.

39:15.540 --> 39:17.540
It's called Cuties in english.

39:17.540 --> 39:19.540
I think it's only available in english or french.

39:19.540 --> 39:21.540
But you could also use subtitles.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.540
Maybe it's also available in german in the meantime.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.540
It was a scandal film.

39:25.540 --> 39:27.540
Because minor girls 12 or 13.

39:27.540 --> 39:29.540
Or how old they were.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.540
It doesn't matter.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.540
They twerk and make music video hip-hop.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.540
And do as if they were the biggest whores in the world.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.540
And it's depicted in the film.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.540
And especially the social structures are depicted.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.540
How it is there.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.540
When you live in a banlieue.

39:43.540 --> 39:45.540
And how it is with this whole hip-hop culture.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.540
Which is absolutely

39:47.540 --> 39:49.540
Downright on this

39:49.540 --> 39:51.540
Muslim tradition world.

39:51.540 --> 39:53.540
From which most girls come.

39:53.540 --> 39:55.540
And especially

39:55.540 --> 39:57.540
This mother and so.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.540
And these family structures, this hierarchy.

39:59.540 --> 40:01.540
That the men can do what they want.

40:01.540 --> 40:03.540
He gets himself a new wife.

40:03.540 --> 40:05.540
That's all super interesting.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.540
And the film was

40:07.540 --> 40:09.540
That's why it was a scandal.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.540
Because it's depicted

40:11.540 --> 40:13.540
That the girls dance like in porn.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.540
But first I have to say

40:15.540 --> 40:17.540
The film is made in such a way

40:17.540 --> 40:19.540
That it's not fetishizing.

40:19.540 --> 40:21.540
It's not depicted as erotic.

40:21.540 --> 40:23.540
But it's depicted

40:23.540 --> 40:25.540
Like other little girls see it.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.540
It's always seen

40:27.540 --> 40:29.540
From the eyes.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.540
From the eyes of viewers.

40:31.540 --> 40:33.540
That are in the film.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.540
For example little girls.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.540
Or some erotic pedos

40:37.540 --> 40:39.540
That sit in the audience and turn it with their smartphone.

40:39.540 --> 40:41.540
That's

40:41.540 --> 40:43.540
In my opinion

40:43.540 --> 40:45.540
Not because of this taste.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.540
But because it's a dangerous film.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.540
Because it suggests something wrong.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.540
I think it suggests the right thing.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.540
And it generates this outrage.

40:53.540 --> 40:55.540
Which had to be clear to everyone.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.540
In my opinion for 20 years.

40:57.540 --> 40:59.540
Since I was 14, 15.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.540
And it will be given before.

41:01.540 --> 41:03.540
It will be more and more because of casualization and scandalization.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.540
The sexualization of the youth

41:05.540 --> 41:07.540
Is a business model.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.540
It was already there at TAF.

41:09.540 --> 41:11.540
There was always

41:11.540 --> 41:13.540
At least once a title to see.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.540
Then the titles became younger and younger.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.540
At some point they had

41:17.540 --> 41:19.540
The final class.

41:19.540 --> 41:21.540
Or summer girl 2010.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.540
Or something like that.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.540
Even before Germany's Next Topmodel.

41:25.540 --> 41:27.540
The youngest of the youngest.

41:27.540 --> 41:29.540
The youngest who can still be seen on TV.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.540
Sexualized.

41:31.540 --> 41:33.540
For the quota.

41:33.540 --> 41:35.540
In mainstream.

41:35.540 --> 41:37.540
And of course

41:37.540 --> 41:39.540
It's available in small.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.540
I saw it back then in school.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.540
The young girls watch it.

41:43.540 --> 41:45.540
And then they do it.

41:45.540 --> 41:47.540
It's nothing special.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.540
And of course they bow down to some wankers.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.540
And force them to prostitution.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.540
I already told you that.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.540
Like in the other clip I made.

41:55.540 --> 41:57.540
That's my example.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.540
And as I said

41:59.540 --> 42:01.540
A good time to get back to the film.

42:01.540 --> 42:03.540
He puts it all so well.

42:03.540 --> 42:05.540
And this stupid brother

42:05.540 --> 42:07.540
In the end he comes back

42:07.540 --> 42:09.540
Into this trap.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.540
Into this therapy.

42:11.540 --> 42:13.540
And they just sit there and

42:13.540 --> 42:15.540
He gives himself to this system.

42:15.540 --> 42:17.540
Because Robert Pattinson is in jail.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.540
He doesn't come out anymore.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.540
That's it.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.540
And he gets there for the rest of his life

42:23.540 --> 42:25.540
In this therapy.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.540
And of course his brother

42:27.540 --> 42:29.540
Had a better plan for him.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.540
To live somewhere in freedom.

42:31.540 --> 42:33.540
Not in this cruel capitalist life.

42:33.540 --> 42:35.540
Where he is only gangled.

42:35.540 --> 42:37.540
And where nothing can happen.

42:37.540 --> 42:39.540
A wonderful film.

42:39.540 --> 42:41.540
A 10 out of 10 for me.

42:41.540 --> 42:43.540
I don't know if the list

42:43.540 --> 42:45.540
That the movie gives me

42:45.540 --> 42:47.540
Or if he sorts them

42:47.540 --> 42:49.540
According to rating.

42:49.540 --> 42:51.540
Or if I press F5.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.540
But I can read what's written here.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.540
It's all a snowball system.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.540
Of course it's all a snowball system.

43:05.540 --> 43:07.540
Well paid employee of Antifa GmbH.

43:07.540 --> 43:09.540
Good evening.

43:09.540 --> 43:11.540
Why are leftists so core disabled?

43:11.540 --> 43:13.540
I think the USA

43:13.540 --> 43:15.540
Will be split sooner or later.

43:15.540 --> 43:17.540
What do you mean

43:17.540 --> 43:19.540
With core disabled Dubai?

43:19.540 --> 43:21.540
I have to say.

43:21.540 --> 43:23.540
I have already noticed

43:23.540 --> 43:25.540
That you tend to the right direction.

43:25.540 --> 43:27.540
But to ask the question like that

43:27.540 --> 43:29.540
Is useless.

43:31.540 --> 43:33.540
The USA will be split sooner or later.

43:33.540 --> 43:35.540
In my opinion the USA are already split.

43:35.540 --> 43:37.540
For a very long time.

43:37.540 --> 43:39.540
I wrote in the stream of Wetzelt

43:39.540 --> 43:41.540
Trump is therefore

43:41.540 --> 43:43.540
In my opinion not a good president

43:43.540 --> 43:45.540
For the USA itself.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.540
Just because he made the biggest

43:47.540 --> 43:49.540
Hex cuts of all time.

43:49.540 --> 43:51.540
He really has the record

43:51.540 --> 43:53.540
For the upper 1%

43:53.540 --> 43:55.540
To get more out and pay less taxes.

43:55.540 --> 43:57.540
And everything else he does

43:57.540 --> 43:59.540
Is of course only smoking.

43:59.540 --> 44:01.540
That is not sustainable.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.540
Because he keeps making the pyramids more pointed.

44:03.540 --> 44:05.540
He makes sure that the redistribution

44:05.540 --> 44:07.540
Is getting more and more intense.

44:07.540 --> 44:09.540
And yes.

44:09.540 --> 44:11.540
In my opinion they are already split.

44:11.540 --> 44:13.540
That has now also been shown

44:13.540 --> 44:15.540
In such unrest as back then

44:15.540 --> 44:17.540
In Wetzelt Charlottesville

44:17.540 --> 44:19.540
Where the guy just drove his car through the demo.

44:19.540 --> 44:21.540
Or later of course

44:21.540 --> 44:23.540
With all kinds of Black Lives Matters

44:23.540 --> 44:25.540
Where there was an autonomous zone

44:25.540 --> 44:27.540
Where no police could enter.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.540
Because of course all Americans with their Gatling

44:29.540 --> 44:31.540
Stand all over the place.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.540
And then they made some stress.

44:33.540 --> 44:35.540
There is already a lot going on

44:35.540 --> 44:37.540
In this country.

44:37.540 --> 44:39.540
I said, in my opinion

44:39.540 --> 44:41.540
Can this only end

44:41.540 --> 44:43.540
That the rich people

44:43.540 --> 44:45.540
Pull back their communities

44:45.540 --> 44:47.540
With a fortress wall around them.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.540
And then it runs.

44:57.540 --> 44:59.540
I smell political conditioning

44:59.540 --> 45:01.540
Around childhood.

45:01.540 --> 45:03.540
It definitely sits deep.

45:03.540 --> 45:05.540
Political conditioning

45:05.540 --> 45:07.540
I wouldn't say that.

45:07.540 --> 45:09.540
I think

45:09.540 --> 45:11.540
Of course it is being tried

45:11.540 --> 45:13.540
But it doesn't sit with children.

45:13.540 --> 45:15.540
Children are not political.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.540
Politically

45:17.540 --> 45:19.540
It is a kind of higher structure

45:19.540 --> 45:21.540
Which at some point in time

45:21.540 --> 45:23.540
Comes in as a pattern of thought.

45:23.540 --> 45:25.540
Politics is for us

45:25.540 --> 45:27.540
An extra pattern of thought.

45:27.540 --> 45:29.540
You would do something politically

45:29.540 --> 45:31.540
Which you don't do privately.

45:31.540 --> 45:33.540
These are separated things.

45:33.540 --> 45:35.540
Children are far too honest

45:35.540 --> 45:37.540
And far too grounded.

45:37.540 --> 45:39.540
They are

45:39.540 --> 45:41.540
Very far

45:41.540 --> 45:43.540
Elementary

45:43.540 --> 45:45.540
What you see with children

45:45.540 --> 45:47.540
Is that

45:47.540 --> 45:49.540
After two years

45:49.540 --> 45:51.540
They have a lot of

45:51.540 --> 45:53.540
Stereotypes

45:53.540 --> 45:55.540
In them.

45:55.540 --> 45:57.540
The first one is man and woman.

45:57.540 --> 45:59.540
That is very important to classification.

45:59.540 --> 46:01.540
Their whole brain

46:01.540 --> 46:03.540
Is designed to

46:03.540 --> 46:05.540
In the first three or four years

46:05.540 --> 46:07.540
To only do feature extraction and classification.

46:07.540 --> 46:09.540
And that is where it gets clarified.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.540
I don't know

46:11.540 --> 46:13.540
I can at least see that

46:13.540 --> 46:15.540
With my daughter.

46:15.540 --> 46:17.540
But that depends on what kind of input comes in.

46:17.540 --> 46:19.540
And you can see that

46:19.540 --> 46:21.540
That these typical men and women

46:21.540 --> 46:23.540
Roll.

46:23.540 --> 46:25.540
The girls should rather

46:25.540 --> 46:27.540
Sit in a corner and read a good book

46:27.540 --> 46:29.540
And the boys should go out.

46:29.540 --> 46:31.540
That is measured

46:31.540 --> 46:33.540
At different kindergartens and schools.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.540
That the staff likes it that way.

46:35.540 --> 46:37.540
And that they don't want to force it.

46:37.540 --> 46:39.540
For example the classic gender roles.

46:39.540 --> 46:41.540
That girls are bad at math.

46:41.540 --> 46:43.540
And boys are the genius engineers.

46:43.540 --> 46:45.540
That is measured

46:45.540 --> 46:47.540
In the kindergarten by themselves.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.540
That is done subconsciously.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.540
And of course many parents do it that way.

46:51.540 --> 46:53.540
That is an indoctrination.

46:53.540 --> 46:55.540
And the political

46:55.540 --> 46:57.540
Has mostly something to do

46:57.540 --> 46:59.540
With the social environment

46:59.540 --> 47:01.540
Where you come from.

47:01.540 --> 47:03.540
Of course in the long run

47:03.540 --> 47:05.540
But especially at the beginning

47:05.540 --> 47:07.540
Kindergarten, early childhood

47:07.540 --> 47:09.540
That is not the case with politics.

47:09.540 --> 47:11.540
I would agree

47:11.540 --> 47:13.540
That later

47:13.540 --> 47:15.540
With 14 to 18

47:15.540 --> 47:17.540
That there is something

47:17.540 --> 47:19.540
That goes in.

47:19.540 --> 47:21.540
Whereby

47:21.540 --> 47:23.540
With 14 to 18

47:23.540 --> 47:25.540
You are mostly

47:25.540 --> 47:27.540
If everything goes wrong

47:27.540 --> 47:29.540
Relatively independent.

47:29.540 --> 47:31.540
I would imagine

47:31.540 --> 47:33.540
I thought about it myself.

47:33.540 --> 47:35.540
I was disappointed

47:35.540 --> 47:37.540
By the left for a long time.

47:37.540 --> 47:39.540
And then I was out.

47:39.540 --> 47:41.540
With 18 to 25

47:41.540 --> 47:43.540
I was

47:43.540 --> 47:45.540
Not interested

47:45.540 --> 47:47.540
In politics at all.

47:47.540 --> 47:49.540
But also

47:49.540 --> 47:51.540
For left, right and so on.

47:51.540 --> 47:53.540
Of course I was always a lefty.

47:53.540 --> 47:55.540
But I felt alienated

47:55.540 --> 47:57.540
By the left scene.

47:57.540 --> 47:59.540
I had green dreadlocks

47:59.540 --> 48:01.540
When I was a teenager.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.540
I was a real disgusting punk.

48:03.540 --> 48:05.540
But later

48:05.540 --> 48:07.540
I politicized myself

48:07.540 --> 48:09.540
By sitting too often in front of the computer.

48:09.540 --> 48:11.540
That is essential.

48:11.540 --> 48:13.540
That's how it came about.

48:13.540 --> 48:15.540
And that's how it came about with my channel.

48:15.540 --> 48:17.540
So

48:17.540 --> 48:19.540
Something happens

48:19.540 --> 48:21.540
In the sense of anyone.

48:21.540 --> 48:23.540
And if it does not happen for profit

48:23.540 --> 48:25.540
But for reasons

48:25.540 --> 48:27.540
For the existence of humanity

48:27.540 --> 48:29.540
As a pattern of thought

48:29.540 --> 48:31.540
A pattern of thought is formed

48:31.540 --> 48:33.540
So that the sexual intercourse decreases or so.

48:33.540 --> 48:35.540
I would say

48:35.540 --> 48:37.540
12 to 15-year puberty phase.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.540
Yes, possible.

48:39.540 --> 48:41.540
So it is definitely so

48:41.540 --> 48:43.540
If I had to conclude from my observation

48:43.540 --> 48:45.540
I also know

48:45.540 --> 48:47.540
Many where I would say

48:47.540 --> 48:49.540
Yes, that has to happen at some point

48:49.540 --> 48:51.540
In this time

48:51.540 --> 48:53.540
That the parents

48:53.540 --> 48:55.540
Their ideology

48:55.540 --> 48:57.540
The children

48:57.540 --> 48:59.540
I would see that too.

48:59.540 --> 49:01.540
But the most important thing

49:01.540 --> 49:03.540
That happens much earlier.

49:03.540 --> 49:05.540
I am convinced of that.

49:05.540 --> 49:07.540
This thing with the ideology

49:07.540 --> 49:09.540
You can then choose yourself at some point.

49:09.540 --> 49:11.540
If you are 15

49:11.540 --> 49:13.540
Then you are able to see the contradictions

49:13.540 --> 49:15.540
Of the ideology of the parents.

49:15.540 --> 49:17.540
That's what most people identify with puberty.

49:17.540 --> 49:19.540
They just see the contradictions of the parents.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.540
And they hold them in the face

49:21.540 --> 49:23.540
And say

49:23.540 --> 49:25.540
That's why I have always kept you.

49:25.540 --> 49:27.540
They recognize that first

49:27.540 --> 49:29.540
They have a mental crisis in puberty.

49:29.540 --> 49:31.540
They realize that they have lived a lie for 10-14 years.

49:31.540 --> 49:33.540
I thought my parents are gods.

49:33.540 --> 49:35.540
And suddenly it doesn't work anymore.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.540
You could also see that with puberty.

49:37.540 --> 49:39.540
It's just a awakening.

49:39.540 --> 49:41.540
That's where the brain

49:41.540 --> 49:43.540
Has reached this stage of development.

49:43.540 --> 49:45.540
To reflect on oneself

49:45.540 --> 49:47.540
And to reflect on others

49:47.540 --> 49:49.540
And to move into others

49:49.540 --> 49:51.540
Where this stage is completely closed.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.540
That's the first result.

49:53.540 --> 49:55.540
What's going on with the world?

49:55.540 --> 49:57.540
It's totally contradicting itself.

49:57.540 --> 49:59.540
There are a thousand contradictions.

49:59.540 --> 50:01.540
It's not clear at all.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.540
That's probably called puberty.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.540
And then it has something to do with farting and farting.

50:05.540 --> 50:07.540
But that's another thing.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.540
That's also coming.

50:09.540 --> 50:11.540
I'm thinking right now

50:11.540 --> 50:13.540
I have to pee.

50:13.540 --> 50:15.540
I've already had too much beer before.

50:15.540 --> 50:17.540
Before we continue with the next film

50:17.540 --> 50:19.540
I'll turn on the music first.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.540
I'm thinking about what to do.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.540
Write in the chat

50:23.540 --> 50:25.540
If you want something hard

50:25.540 --> 50:27.540
Or if you want something relaxed.

50:27.540 --> 50:29.540
And I'll think about it.

50:49.540 --> 50:51.540
What's hard?

50:51.540 --> 50:53.540
Yes, that you say that.

50:53.540 --> 50:55.540
Death row.

50:55.540 --> 50:57.540
I could have thought of that.

50:57.540 --> 50:59.540
Okay, but because you want death row

50:59.540 --> 51:01.540
You definitely want some black metal.

51:01.540 --> 51:03.540
And I don't like that.

51:03.540 --> 51:05.540
Hard, relaxed.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.540
Difficult.

51:07.540 --> 51:09.540
It works, of course.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.540
But I'll do it first.

51:11.540 --> 51:13.540
A little bit of death metal.

51:13.540 --> 51:15.540
And then I'm going to pee

51:15.540 --> 51:17.540
And then I'll be right there.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.540
And then I'm going to pee and then I'll be right there.

51:19.540 --> 51:21.540
We'll do it here.

51:23.540 --> 51:25.540
There, that's good.

51:47.540 --> 51:49.540
That's good.

52:17.540 --> 52:19.540
That's good.

52:47.540 --> 52:49.540
That's good.

53:17.540 --> 53:19.540
That's good.

53:47.540 --> 53:49.540
That's good.

54:17.540 --> 54:19.540
That's good.

54:47.540 --> 54:51.540
Are you ready?

55:17.540 --> 55:19.540
That's good.

55:47.540 --> 55:49.540
That's good.

55:49.540 --> 55:51.540
That's good.

55:51.540 --> 55:53.540
That's good.

56:09.540 --> 56:13.540
Does he think that the coal soup was bad?

56:13.540 --> 56:15.540
While he spits them out?

56:15.540 --> 56:17.540
or does it only look like a bandwagon?

56:17.540 --> 56:25.540
Well, that's a stylistic tool that doesn't appeal to the common listener at all.

56:25.540 --> 56:27.540
That's anti-casualization.

56:27.540 --> 56:37.540
And when I was young, I listened to Korn and Rammstein.

56:37.540 --> 56:40.540
The first Korn album and the first Rammstein album.

56:40.540 --> 56:43.540
I listened to them in the first and second grade.

56:43.540 --> 56:46.540
That was the shit back then. I thought that was crazy.

56:46.540 --> 56:51.540
And then I was in a fan camp.

56:51.540 --> 56:55.540
Maybe I've already told you the story.

56:55.540 --> 56:58.540
In a fan camp there was a buddy of a teacher.

56:58.540 --> 57:01.540
An awful metalhead. It's clear to me now that he was a metalhead.

57:01.540 --> 57:04.540
He said, here boy, you can already hear the crazy music.

57:04.540 --> 57:07.540
Come to my car. I have a great facility in the car.

57:07.540 --> 57:09.540
No homo, no pedo.

57:09.540 --> 57:14.540
And then he played me Morbid Angel or Cannibal Corpse or something like that.

57:14.540 --> 57:16.540
And it was just exactly that.

57:16.540 --> 57:20.540
What is the man doing there? Why does it sound so stupid? What is that? What is he supposed to do?

57:20.540 --> 57:24.540
And then he said, if you listen to something like that now, you'll hear something like that later.

57:24.540 --> 57:27.540
And I said, no, that doesn't make any sense at all. It's shit.

57:27.540 --> 57:30.540
And it's actually like that. You have to develop a ear for it.

57:30.540 --> 57:34.540
It's like for a good wine or for a whiskey or something.

57:34.540 --> 57:36.540
You have to develop a taste for it.

57:36.540 --> 57:39.540
You have to have a sense of sensibility.

57:39.540 --> 57:43.540
And with that kind of music, I've had the craziest thing with black metal.

57:43.540 --> 57:48.540
For ten years, after I've already heard super extreme music,

57:48.540 --> 57:51.540
I've still dedicated myself to black metal for its rudeness.

57:51.540 --> 57:54.540
And it's only been a few years since I've been able to hear black metal.

57:54.540 --> 57:58.540
And yes, that's how it is for the...

57:58.540 --> 58:01.540
So if you've never heard that before, then it's not for you.

58:01.540 --> 58:02.540
You're thinking, what's the point of that?

58:02.540 --> 58:05.540
First of all, it sounds super stupid. You're thinking, what kind of stupid thing is that?

58:05.540 --> 58:07.540
But that's always the case with art.

58:07.540 --> 58:09.540
And the most obviously stupid thing is, of course, hip-hop.

58:09.540 --> 58:13.540
And that attracts everyone, of course, because it's very easy to understand.

58:13.540 --> 58:16.540
That's full, no casualization.

58:16.540 --> 58:19.540
Because that's all about how you become a pimp.

58:19.540 --> 58:24.540
And the boys think that with 12, 13, 14, 15, of course, that's great.

58:24.540 --> 58:26.540
Anyway, another topic.

58:26.540 --> 58:30.540
So, hard, relaxed comes next.

58:30.540 --> 58:32.540
And then comes relaxed electromove.

58:32.540 --> 58:34.540
That's all I have.

58:36.540 --> 58:38.540
Ah.

58:38.540 --> 58:40.540
A Mindener?

58:40.540 --> 58:42.540
No, he didn't come from Minden.

58:42.540 --> 58:44.540
He came here directly from my city.

58:44.540 --> 58:46.540
I sometimes see him on the Christmas market.

58:46.540 --> 58:48.540
And I tell him that he shaped me.

58:48.540 --> 58:50.540
As a little child.

58:50.540 --> 58:53.540
Of course, he can't remember it, but I can't remember him.

58:53.540 --> 58:55.540
I always tell him that.

58:55.540 --> 58:57.540
Yes, of course.

58:57.540 --> 58:59.540
So, let's move on to the list.

58:59.540 --> 59:01.540
Let's move on to the list.

59:01.540 --> 59:03.540
So, the next thing on my list is the film.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.540
Which is also completely unknown.

59:05.540 --> 59:07.540
Black 47.

59:07.540 --> 59:09.540
I don't even know what it's called.

59:09.540 --> 59:11.540
No, it's also called Black 47 in German.

59:11.540 --> 59:14.540
And the film takes place in Ireland.

59:14.540 --> 59:19.540
At the time when the British Empire was still big at the start.

59:19.540 --> 59:25.540
And since then, the Iranians have had the worst hatred of Great Britain.

59:25.540 --> 59:27.540
Because they were the colonial powers.

59:27.540 --> 59:29.540
They were occupiers.

59:29.540 --> 59:31.540
They just went through imperialism.

59:31.540 --> 59:33.540
With the Iranians.

59:33.540 --> 59:36.540
With the Gaelic people, who just wanted to wander around.

59:36.540 --> 59:38.540
And the film begins.

59:38.540 --> 59:40.540
There comes a soldier from the war again.

59:40.540 --> 59:42.540
Who swore for the British.

59:42.540 --> 59:46.540
He is a traitor for the Iranians.

59:46.540 --> 59:50.540
And he just wants to go home to his family.

59:50.540 --> 59:52.540
And he arrives and sees that the house is destroyed.

59:52.540 --> 59:54.540
The family is no longer really there.

59:54.540 --> 59:58.540
And he is then first of all taken into this paper logic.

59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.540
Who are you? Why don't you have ID papers?

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.540
And so on and so forth.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.540
Then he smashes them all away.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.540
And so it really rots out.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.540
And the scene that made capitalism critical for me.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.540
Is the situation.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:16.540
That there are the remains of his family.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.540
I believe his sister.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.540
His little sister has a child.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.540
She lives with her husband.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.540
In an abandoned house.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.540
In the middle of nowhere.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.540
In the middle of Pampa there is nothing.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.540
Except such a tram and a stone house.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.540
With a straw roof around it.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.540
And it's cold as hell. It's winter.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.540
The people die out there just because it's so cold.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.540
His old original house.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.540
So where she comes from, it's bombed away.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.540
There is nothing left.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.540
And they live in this house where nothing is.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.540
Where nobody bothers.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.540
And suddenly the British militia arrives.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.540
And ensures justice and order.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.540
Because they don't even own this property.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.540
They don't own this property at all.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.540
It's written on a piece of paper.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.540
That it belongs to someone else.

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.540
And nobody bothers.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.540
But they just bother.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.540
Because they are the colonial power.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.540
And they want to suppress them.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.540
And with that the film starts.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.540
That's the 14th or 15th minute.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.540
Or maybe half an hour.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.540
There is this scene.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.540
And it's so absurd.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.540
Because it shows exactly how it is with the property.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.540
It's cold as hell.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.540
And they get shot.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.540
That means they die.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.540
Because it's minus 10 degrees.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.540
The man thinks it's shit.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.540
And he gets shot by the soldiers.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.540
Who only do their duty.

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.540
And in the film it's shown very well.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.540
If you talk to some of the irons.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.540
At best old irons.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.540
They have the story in their pockets.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.540
How it is with the British.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.540
With the great power of Great Britain.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.540
Why they are so powerful.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.540
Why they are so powerful.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.540
Why they are so powerful.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.540
And how they have

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.540
in the smallest

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.540
already

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.540
built out their power structures.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.540
And just suppressed people.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.540
Just for fun.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540
The film is a bit dystopian.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.540
The film seems to me

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.540
so dark and so disgusting.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.540
And everything is hopeless.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.540
And so really disgusting.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.540
It reminds me of The Road.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.540
Just because of the climate.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.540
Because it's so shit and so dystopian.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.540
It's just really shit.

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.540
And that's why

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.540
the film plays in the past.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.540
But he sees

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.540
in front of my inner eye

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.540
he felt

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.540
as if it was a representation

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.540
for a future version.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.540
As if it was a dystopian film.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.540
As if we could go back

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.540
in such a situation.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.540
That's how the film affects me.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.540
I can't really describe it.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.540
Because nobody would think

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.540
that this is a capitalism film.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.540
But somehow for me

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.540
it's probably because of my selection bias.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.540
Because I make so many

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540
YouTube videos.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.540
And I have this English channel

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.540
one year longer than the German one.

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.540
I'm more active with the Snow Wall system.

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.540
With all these ideas.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.540
To criticize that.

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.540
I think that's the reason.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.540
It's always like that.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.540
When you have tunnel vision

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.540
you only have the nail

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.540
and the hammer.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.540
That's about it.

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.540
The next film is The Big Short.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.540
I don't need to talk about it.

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.540
It's clear.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.540
The best part of the film is Brad Pitt.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.540
Like with Killings and Softly.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.540
He's a really cool guy.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.540
But I don't need to talk about it.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.540
The film is well known.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.540
It's 2008, financial crisis,

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.540
perfectly explained.

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.540
In a really cool movie.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.540
All around.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.540
Hollywood.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.540
Nice people are shown.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.540
They tell you something.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.540
The film tells

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.540
a nice story.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.540
Around this whole situation.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.540
And how criminal

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.540
the banks and the rating agencies are.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.540
How criminal they are.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.540
That's shown really well.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.540
And of course it's fantastic.

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.540
Every single aspect,

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.540
every level of the Snow Wall system

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.540
is shown.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.540
I just missed the context.

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.540
You're the one with the hot air balloon, right?

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.540
I don't get it.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.540
Kvairz wrote a Minden-Thunder.

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.540
I thought he meant someone from Minden.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.540
Then Felix Fuchs-Hase

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.540
felt like he was talking.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.540
Because he's from Minden.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.540
Now Kvairz says at least.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.540
And then he says something about the hot air balloon.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.540
That's too hard for me.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.540
In Hip-Hop

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.540
there are underground styles.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.540
Psycho-Core for example.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.540
Where you think WTF.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.540
The majority is categorization

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.540
up to 10. But another topic.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.540
Sure, in Hip-Hop

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.540
actually

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.540
I never really thought about it.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.540
But I always had the feeling that

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.540
Hip-Hop is about class struggle.

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.540
About how you can

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.540
as a little man

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.540
fight your life in the worst way

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.540
in the USA, where there is no solidarity.

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.540
And if you grow up in a block

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.540
somewhere in a new settlement

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.540
in the East it's nothing different.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.540
You can do Hip-Hop about it.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.540
Because the stories of the streets

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.540
happen there. The whole country.

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.540
You see it.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.540
And you have something to tell.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.540
And that's being transported in Hip-Hop.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.540
It's being transported very well.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.540
Because you don't need musical skills for it.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.540
To make a beat is trivial.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.540
Or you always find someone who can do it.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.540
And the rest is alienation.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.540
Then you can rap about it.

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:04.540
Of course you don't need the skills.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.540
It's all art.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.540
Because you have to do it with the rhyme.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.540
And really cool boys can do it live.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.540
You give them a theme about what they should rap about

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.540
and then they do it.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.540
That's a lot of art. I don't want to deny that.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.540
But mainstream rap is of course ridiculous.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.540
In Germany it's even more ridiculous.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.540
Because everything that happens in Germany

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.540
in mainstream is really the funniest.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.540
It's always copied from the USA.

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.540
They just copy the trends from there.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.540
And then they make it worse.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.540
You see that everywhere.

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.540
With Joko and Klaas.

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.540
With the men's world.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.540
It's just a copy of Me Too.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.540
Things like that.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.540
Even that. It's super ridiculous.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.540
And you see it even crazier with the German influencers.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.540
They just copy content directly.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.540
And the one who puts it on the top

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.540
is of course Mani Boy.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.540
Mani Boy is just a funny guy.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.540
With all his nonsense.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.540
100% is basically every video

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.540
of any other American influencer

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.540
who makes Hip-Hop.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.540
100%. Just copied.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.540
It's just funny.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.540
What's the next movie?

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.540
The next movie.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.540
The big crash margin call.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.540
It's at least as awesome

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.540
as The Big Short.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.540
But it's a bit more unknown.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.540
First with Kevin Spacey.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.540
It's great.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.540
But mostly

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.540
from a different perspective.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.540
The movie is also about

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.540
the 2008 financial crisis.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.540
But from the perspective

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.540
of The Big Short

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.540
the decision-making levels

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.540
the banks, the politics

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.540
the rating agencies

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.540
the big companies

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.540
From this perspective

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.540
The Big Short is not represented.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.540
It's a middle class.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.540
With the big crash

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.540
at margin call

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.540
it's about the top level

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.540
of some kind of

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.540
I assume

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.540
some financial advisory company

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.540
or something like that.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.540
Could be another

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:20.540
snowball system. Doesn't matter.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.540
It's so awesome.

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.540
It's just like

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.540
a piece of paper.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:30.540
The audience doesn't know

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.540
what's on the paper.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.540
They panic.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.540
They want to know what's on the paper.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.540
But the audience doesn't know

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.540
what's on the paper.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.540
The paper goes all the way

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.540
up in the snowball system.

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.540
At some point Kevin Spacey comes

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.540
by. Kevin Spacey is

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.540
one of the last

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.540
in this pyramid.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.540
And that's super awesome.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.540
Because on the paper

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.540
our system collabs.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.540
Our mathematical models

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.540
have results.

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.540
And everyone sees the crash

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.540
and has to limit the damage.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.540
And in the movie

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.540
it's shown pretty well.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.540
The smallest wankers

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.540
die from their job.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.540
They tank the damage.

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.540
In the end.

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.540
People like Kevin Spacey

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.540
The absolute

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.540
king is a famous actor.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.540
I can't remember his name.

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.540
He plays a great role.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.540
Because he's the absolute

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.540
top mafia mob.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.540
Everyone has respect for him.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.540
And the best scene

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.540
in the movie

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.540
is where

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.540
a small

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.540
middleman

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.540
explains how the business works.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.540
That's so awesome.

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.540
I laughed my ass off.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.540
I was so happy.

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.540
That was super serious.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.540
In the cabrio he explains how the business works.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.540
And in the end

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.540
the little wanker went to the toilet

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.540
and puked.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.540
And that sucked.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.540
Just because he explained

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.540
how messy capitalism really is.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.540
And that he lived a lie when he

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.540
made the propaganda fairy

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.540
to be successful

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.540
and to be a great businessman.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.540
That's super shown in the movie.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:20.540
A great movie.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:22.540
And much less known than The Big Short.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.540
But totally wrong.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.540
He has to be known.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.540
Everyone should know him in the movie.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.540
He's like The Big Short.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.540
He tells about capitalism.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.540
He talks about it.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.540
You don't have to talk in metaphors.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.540
It's not a hidden story

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.540
like in Good Time or Killing Them Softly

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.540
where you have to think about it.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.540
It hits you right in the face.

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.540
How it is with the alienation.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.540
And with the Wall Street.

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.540
That's super.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.540
That's a really awesome movie.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.540
And he has so many details.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.540
So many details.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.540
Like I said, it starts with the note.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:02.540
And then all these dialogues.

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.540
And Kevin Spacey is also

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.540
and that's always the nice thing.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.540
You want to think that they are all winners of the system.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.540
But you can see very clearly that they are not.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.540
They all have a terrible life.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.540
Kevin Spacey is the main character.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.540
And he is also

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.540
depicted a little bit

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.540
of his private life.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.540
How toxic it all is.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.540
He's separated from his wife.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.540
The only flaw I have

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.540
with The Big Crash is that

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.540
the smart-spirited geek-nerd-2-type

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.540
is an engineer.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.540
It's always depicted

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.540
as if the engineers

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.540
are the cool guys with the math

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.540
and the crazy knowledge.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.540
But in reality it's more

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.540
IT-ers,

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.540
mathematicians or physicists

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.540
who do this shit.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.540
Because they are the ones with the math skills.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.540
You have to imagine that in a pyramid.

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.540
You have math, that's the shit.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.540
That's the real shit.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.540
But it's often too abstract.

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.540
Only if you're up for it before, you go after the math

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.540
in something else.

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:04.540
Otherwise people just stay there in the math

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.540
and prove that some 74-dimensional rings

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.540
create some crazy algebras

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.540
and structures

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.540
and that's why they form a group.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.540
That's what they do.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.540
But there are two kinds of math.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.540
One is computer science,

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.540
so IT.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.540
It's basically applied math.

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.540
Theoretical Informatics 1 and 2

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.540
are only about

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.540
formal

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.540
proofability and decision-making

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.540
and things like that.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.540
And in the end Goedel's Inconvenience.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.540
And the other thing is physics.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.540
That's the description of what we see out here

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.540
with the language of mathematics.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.540
Those are the two adults.

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.540
And everything below that,

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.540
biology,

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.540
geology,

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.540
economics,

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.540
I don't even want to start with that.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.540
It doesn't count at all.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.540
That's a bastard.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.540
The priest once

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.540
accidentally

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.540
fucked a boy's ass, but a girl's

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.540
and she got pregnant.

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.540
That's the motto.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.540
And other than that

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.540
chemistry, engineering,

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.540
engineers,

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.540
those are craftsmen,

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.540
those are people with a screwdriver in their hands.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.540
The real nerds

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.540
are math, physics

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.540
and computer science.

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.540
But computer science is difficult

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.540
because you have a lot of computer scientists

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.540
who do something far from mathematics.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.540
In the end they only become web designers

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.540
or admins in some

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.540
different structures and so on.

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.540
But real computer science,

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.540
the really crazy shit,

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.540
that's super sexy.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.540
And I would go a little bit in that direction

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.540
with cryptography, for example.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.540
That's what I'm working on right now.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.540
But also a lot of other things.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.540
Decisiveness problems, NP,

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.540
completeness, stuff like that,

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.540
Turing machine, everything that has to do with it.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:56.540
That's mathematics.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.540
That's completely clear.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.540
That's just a concrete application

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.540
of the language.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:04.540
Because predictability is

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.540
a question of mathematics.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.540
But it is occupied by computer science

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.540
and there are

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:12.540
extra lectures about it and so on.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.540
But in my opinion it all comes together.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.540
If you are a real physicist,

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.540
you also include IT and math.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.540
If you are a real mathematician, you also include math and computer science.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.540
If you are a real mathematician, you also include math.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.540
Physics mostly not because

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.540
it is an application

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.540
that most IT people are not interested in.

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.540
They want to understand how a quantum computer works.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.540
But that's a different story.

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.540
I'm a little disappointed

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.540
because of the engineer.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.540
But otherwise the movie is great.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.540
Except for the engineer, the movie is absolutely great.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.540
Where am I?

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.540
I'll read a little more.

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.540
Yes, enough awesome hip-hop.

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.540
Honestly, I've already heard

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.540
from Alligator that it should be nice.

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:58.540
I can't say anything about the others.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.540
Yandilay, Semidilux, Dendemann.

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.540
It all sounds like nonsense to me.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.540
Who do I like the most?

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.540
The one over there.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.540
The one hanging on the wall over there.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.540
Captain Peng.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.540
He is great.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.540
Captain Peng, can you

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.540
take a look at it?

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.540
There are a few things on YouTube.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.540
Super awesome, of course very poetic.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.540
Deep-seated philosophical texts.

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:24.540
Super packed.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.540
Super packed, I think it's great.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.540
I'm a fan, I've seen it live.

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.540
Captain Peng and the tetake from Delphi.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.540
The woman was already pregnant.

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.540
We pulled ourselves in, that was great.

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.540
I like him for example.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.540
I'm also really into Romano.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.540
Just because of the middleman.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.540
Because the guy represents this ambivalence.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.540
He has so much because

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.540
he grew up in the 90s.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.540
He ate it all up.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.540
You can tell by the way he talks

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.540
that he has all these cultural influences.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:54.540
And that's great.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.540
I drove to Osnabrück

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.540
and saw him live and showed him

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.540
my metal cut and we did a high five.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.540
That was great. I like him.

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.540
He's just nice.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.540
And he does funny stuff.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.540
He also does capitalism criticism.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.540
If he wants to.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.540
I'm sure there's good hip-hop.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.540
Especially because

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.540
it's a grassroots thing.

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.540
From the streets.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.540
With attitudes.

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.540
It's the struggle.

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.540
Against the hierarchy and the shit.

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.540
Against our expansion system.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.540
You have to say how shitty it is.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.540
I just remembered another movie.

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.540
I have to play it before I continue.

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.540
Or I'll forget it.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.540
It's called

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:38.540
The one with Jennifer Lopez.

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.540
Don't be surprised.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.540
It's great.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.540
It's called Hustlers.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.540
Hustlers.

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.540
I'll talk about it later.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.540
Then we'll have it.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.540
It's a great movie.

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:56.540
Hustlers.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.540
Where do I have it?

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.540
Imagine.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.540
Jennifer Lopez

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.540
is a stripper

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.540
in the USA.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.540
She has to get around

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.540
and she has a kid.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.540
She has to pay the rent.

01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.540
Like all Americans.

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.540
It's always the complete alienation.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.540
They only do the job because of the money.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.540
She finds out

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.540
that you can get bigger money

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.540
when you do private parties

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.540
with the fat punks.

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.540
You only need

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.540
a few girls.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.540
She knows enough girls

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.540
that you can get around.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.540
The great thing is

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.540
we do private parties

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.540
with their wives.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.540
They don't like their wives.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.540
They are managers.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.540
They all have a wife.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.540
So they do this.

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.540
They do a party with their wives.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.540
They give them drugs.

01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.540
They steal their credit cards

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.540
and take the money.

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.540
They pull the money

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.540
out of the hierarchy

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.540
like Robin Hood.

01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:08.540
That's the business model.

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.540
It works well.

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.540
In the movie

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.540
you can see certain aspects

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.540
of how it works.

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:18.540
With the strip-shops

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.540
and the logic of use.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.540
If you are too bad

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.540
you have to piss yourself off.

01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:26.540
You have to do casualization

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.540
and marketing.

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.540
It looks great.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.540
Not with academic words.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.540
Not like in a lecture.

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.540
Just like it looks

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.540
on the street.

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:40.540
That's awesome.

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.540
It's not academic.

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.540
It's easy for everyone

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.540
why the problems

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.540
are for this person

01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.540
and why they act like that.

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.540
That's great.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.540
Jennifer Lopez

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.540
does a great business out of it.

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.540
She modifies it

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.540
and expands it.

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.540
She gets more girls

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:04.540
who can take more orders.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.540
Who expand more

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.540
and maybe to other cities.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.540
That's great.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.540
I haven't seen the movie

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.540
for a long time.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.540
It's not that long

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:18.540
but I don't know how it ends.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.540
The movie was

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.540
a great criticism of capitalism.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.540
It's a perfect movie

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.540
because it shows

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.540
a certain aspect

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.540
of capitalism

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.540
that you can't kill.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.540
It's about

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.540
the business aspects

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.540
of capitalism.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.540
Jennifer Lopez has to calculate

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.540
and clear her business.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.540
She has to stay clean

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:46.540
and have a clear mind.

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.540
I've seen

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.540
another movie

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.540
where a woman

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.540
is hosting

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.540
poker tournaments.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.540
She's crazy.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.540
What was the name of the movie?

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.540
If my wife

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.540
would watch it,

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.540
she would have

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.540
drunk too much alcohol

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.540
after the barbecue.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.540
I think she's drunk already.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.540
If she would watch it,

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:16.540
she would know the movie.

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.540
It's a movie

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.540
where a woman

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.540
is hosting

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:24.540
poker tournaments.

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.540
This nerd

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.540
also participates.

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:30.540
Who participates?

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.540
Kevin Costner.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.540
I just need to go through

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.540
the movie list with Kevin Costner.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.540
Kevin Costner.

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.540
I click on it.

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.540
Filmography.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.540
Then I scroll down.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.540
This has to happen.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.540
The movie is called Molly's Game.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.540
Great.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.540
Molly's Game.

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.540
Not bad.

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:00.540
I'll put it in the list.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.540
Great movie about capitalism.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.540
It's like this.

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.540
Kevin Costner

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.540
has, I think,

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.540
three children.

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.540
And Kevin Costner is a great guy.

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:18.540
The woman is still awake.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.540
I already took over the job.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.540
I found out the movie.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.540
But it's funny.

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:26.540
You can talk to the boys

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.540
if you write funny things.

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:30.540
He has three children.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.540
They are all elite children.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.540
He promotes and demands

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.540
endlessly.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.540
He makes real professionals out of him.

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.540
Everything they do is to the max.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.540
Only pro-gamer-wise.

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.540
High level, upper point, one percent.

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.540
If you bring performance,

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.540
you have to get the gold medal in the Olympics.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.540
For example, at the ski jump.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.540
Molly,

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.540
the main character,

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.540
she does ski jumping.

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.540
She pulls something in here

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.540
and gets something crazy everywhere.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.540
A finish here and there.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.540
Super cool.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.540
The movie is so funny

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.540
because it shows

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.540
exactly this scaling

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.540
and the business model.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.540
It's off-secret

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.540
because

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.540
luck in this scale

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.540
is forbidden in the USA

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.540
as soon as you take something from the pot.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.540
As soon as you take a profit.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.540
It's well represented.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.540
She has a lawyer

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.540
and then there's a trial.

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.540
It's about honor

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.540
and now

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.540
it's about

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.540
it's about

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.540
patriarchy

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.540
and how women

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.540
in this world

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.540
can achieve more

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.540
if they want to.

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.540
They have to push through.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.540
The fight, the struggle,

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.540
it's so well represented.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.540
And she's a crazy troll.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.540
She can do everything.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.540
She's very intellectual

01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.540
and she looks good

01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:06.540
and she could achieve everything.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.540
But she wants to do

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.540
these half-illegal business.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.540
That's her thing.

01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:14.540
She just wanted to get her daddy

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:16.540
out of it.

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.540
But the movie is great

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.540
and it's about capitalism.

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:22.540
Mully's Game

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.540
I can only recommend it.

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.540
It's not direct.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.540
It's not like Margin Call

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.540
or The Big Shot where you say

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.540
capitalism is going to blow your face.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.540
You look at it from the perspective

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.540
with the glasses

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.540
that I want to show you.

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.540
It's all a snowball system.

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.540
Look where the snowball system is.

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.540
Then you see the snowball systems everywhere.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.540
It's no wonder.

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.540
The next movie

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.540
that I want to talk about

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.540
is the first movie

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.540
with Robert Pattinson

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.540
that I saw

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.540
where I thought,

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.540
maybe this guy has potential.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.540
Cosmopolis

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.540
The movie itself is not great.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.540
It's almost an art movie.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.540
I don't want to say David Lynch

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.540
but it seems

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.540
like an art movie

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.540
because it has

01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.540
absurd actions.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.540
Robert Pattinson seems

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.540
to be an extremely rich guy

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.540
who drives around in a limousine.

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.540
And outside the limousine

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.540
the whole world collapses.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.540
Probably after 2008

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.540
in a financial crash.

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.540
That's the setting.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.540
That's what I think.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540
It's not really named.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.540
He does his rounds

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.540
with his limousine,

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:46.540
goes to stores, has quests.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.540
And in the end

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.540
it culminates

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.540
because he's hanging around

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.540
in a limousine.

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.540
I don't know if the woman will listen.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.540
There's a guy

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.540
who was once released

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:02.540
by his father

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.540
and since then

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.540
his existence sucks

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.540
and he feels really bad.

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.540
And the whole movie

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:12.540
has this obvious touch.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.540
Take a look at the elite

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.540
how disgusting they are on the road.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.540
That's shown really well.

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.540
And Robert Pattinson

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.540
is the perfect actor for it

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.540
because he's a boy.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.540
He's a slippery boy.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.540
He's a Christian Bale

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.540
American Psycho-like

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.540
but without muckies.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.540
A really slippery boy.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.540
You look at him when he's wearing a suit

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.540
and you think, is he unsympathetic?

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:40.540
That's a rich,

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.540
shabby wessie footsie

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.540
who grew up with a golden spoon

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:46.540
and is a really disgusting wessie.

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:48.540
He got everything in shit

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.540
and doesn't need to do anything

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.540
and says, I earned it,

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.540
I got my status, I got it.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.540
That's the movie.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.540
That's the feeling you get

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:00.540
when you see this movie.

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:02.540
And when you see Robert Pattinson

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.540
when he shaved his ass.

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.540
That's my suggestion

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.540
because I like to think in these stereotypes.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.540
And that's

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.540
definitely an interesting movie

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.540
because, as I said, that was the first movie

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.540
I think that was the movie after

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.540
this Twilight shit.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.540
He already decided

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.540
to make serious movies that are kind of crazy.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:24.540
And you have to expect that from him.

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.540
Sure, this shit with the vampires

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.540
he had to do

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.540
I mean, it's not bad.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.540
You make a name, you earn money

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.540
that's mainstream.

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.540
But then the question is,

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.540
do you continue in the snowball system?

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.540
Or do you want to get even crazier

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.540
and make even more shit movies?

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.540
Or do you want to make interesting movies?

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:46.540
And I would expect that from him.

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.540
And as I said, all the movies

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:50.540
I've seen with him

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.540
made me think that he's a serious guy

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.540
who actually wants

01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:56.540
real movie content.

01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.540
I think that's great.

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.540
Cosmopolis.

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.540
And as I said,

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.540
you have to go

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.540
in the video description

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.540
and click on the link

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.540
so you can see the list,

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.540
the movie pilot list.

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.540
So, what does it say here?

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.540
Moneyboy is not satirical?

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.540
Yes, Moneyboy.

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.540
Like in the office.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.540
When it started with the swag

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.540
and that's already a copy of another original.

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.540
There's a hip-hopper who thinks it's serious.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.540
We also thought that it's a satire.

01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:38.540
But he's also touring with it

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.540
and he's serious.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.540
He goes on stage and he does it.

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.540
And there's the hip-hop crowd and they like it.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.540
And he likes it too. He's a hip-hop person.

01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.540
That's what I'm really talking about.

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.540
He also does interviews with hip-hop channels

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.540
and he lives this style.

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.540
He also wrote a bachelor or master's

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.540
about this topic with hip-hop

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.540
and how to market it.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.540
I think that's an ambivalence.

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.540
He finds it interesting,

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.540
but he also focuses on the music.

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.540
I really think that

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.540
he's

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.540
in this respect

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.540
not a pure satire project

01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.540
like Akan and Stefan, for example.

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.540
In case that tells you something.

01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:18.540
I'm a kid from the 90s

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.540
so I know something like that.

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.540
Yes, Moneyboy. Of course he's from Switzerland.

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.540
No, Austria. I don't know.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:26.540
Wait. Wien City.

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:28.540
He's from Wien City.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.540
That's right. Hip-hop against the original class struggle.

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.540
The other two-packed songs are

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.540
disaster,

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.540
mainstream,

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.540
class struggle. There's still enough hip-hop.

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.540
I'm not an expert.

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.540
But apart from hip-hop,

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.540
Techno is a product made in Germany.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.540
Yes, it can be.

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.540
I don't know them. I think they're super lame.

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.540
Mühmänner hören Techno.

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.540
I know enough people who aren't Mühmänner

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.540
who also listen to Techno.

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.540
In my opinion, this is the real musical

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.540
milestone of Germany

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.540
worldwide.

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.540
The real musical milestone

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.540
of Germany

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.540
worldwide.

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.540
First of all,

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.540
all the classical composers.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.540
Sure, we don't need to talk about that.

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.540
Germany, super sick.

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.540
But then, Rammstein.

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.540
Lol.

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:22.540
Rammstein.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.540
If someone is an exporter here,

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.540
then it's Rammstein.

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.540
And then, of course, there are

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.540
Scorpions.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.540
Just from the scale of success,

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.540
Scorpions. And there are

01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.540
a few other creators, for example.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.540
In thrash metal, they're huge.

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.540
Or...

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.540
There are a few other really sick

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:44.540
German bands. Necrophagous

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.540
is, in my opinion, a purely German band.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.540
But they're only in

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:50.540
tech desks, so to speak, legends.

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:52.540
But they have a legend status for that.

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.540
There are a lot of German bands

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.540
that are really sick. And techno.

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.540
I don't know much about that.

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.540
But I would have thought,

01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.540
techno is identical all over the world.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.540
And there is no

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.540
belonging to any artist

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.540
or so. I thought, you can't

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.540
distinguish that. That's such an

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.540
indistinguishable, analogue mass.

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.540
Whether you now take the techno song

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.540
that takes one and a half hours

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.540
from one, or party

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.540
on the other track

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.540
that takes one and a half hours or so.

01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.540
I don't know. You'd have to tell me

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.540
which sick boys in techno

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:28.540
are really hard.

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.540
Kraftwerk or something. It could be.

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.540
But they're just...

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.540
They're actually pioneers.

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.540
I don't know if they're counted

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.540
as techno. I really don't know

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.540
much about that.

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.540
I, as an incoming engineer,

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:52.540
feel very offended by that.

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.540
Yes, well paid employee of

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.540
Antifa GmbH. I'm sorry.

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.540
But that's my

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.540
elitist pissbubble in which

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.540
I find myself. Because I just

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.540
have too much experience

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:06.540
with engineers. I'm

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.540
an incoming doctor engineer.

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.540
I'm myself. I'm also an engineer

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.540
on paper. And in my

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.540
last seven years I've only had to do

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.540
with engineers.

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.540
And that's my experience

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:20.540
that I have there.

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:22.540
Many of them can only blackbox.

01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.540
What they can't do very much is

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.540
really apply mathematics.

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.540
Most of them can't even understand

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.540
what a Fourier transformation is.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.540
They don't understand that. They have

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.540
mostly a symbolism. They can do that,

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:36.540
but they can't interpret it. And in my

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.540
exercises I see the inflation rate

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.540
really brutal. I do exercises for

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.540
engineers. Medical technology.

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:44.540
That's essentially electrical engineering.

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:46.540
And for a while I've only had the

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.540
electrical engineer and medical engineer.

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.540
They come from a school and

01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.540
two weeks before the school starts

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.540
they do math preparation.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.540
But that's essentially

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:58.540
what the Abitur doesn't do anymore.

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.540
But what you need to get to the university.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:02.540
And there you can see how brutal

01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.540
that is.

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.540
And it continues.

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:08.540
It doesn't get any better.

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:10.540
Then master students come out

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.540
who are sitting in an exam

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.540
with me. Electrical engineering.

01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.540
They don't write down the Roman law.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:18.540
That's super ridiculous. But classical

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.540
is just Fourier analysis.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.540
Normal...

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:24.540
I don't know. Normal

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.540
functional theory I don't want to say.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.540
But algebra, so to speak.

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:30.540
The nearest algebra.

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.540
I only see deficits everywhere.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.540
And that's

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.540
for some reason

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.540
the problem is huge for engineers.

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:40.540
And for physicists

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:42.540
And the mathematicians

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.540
I had to deal with until now,

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:46.540
didn't.

01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:48.540
But that's a very personal

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.540
view of me.

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.540
Of course that can be different

01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.540
on the big scale.

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.540
But that's what I see.

01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.540
That the engineer

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.540
is more of a low-level

01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:02.540
flat wanker.

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.540
And of course it can be that you're a

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.540
crazy boy and a crazy dude and just want to use it

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.540
and that's why you're an engineer.

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.540
But that's not a thing.

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.540
Nothing wrong with it.

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:14.540
I only say what I see

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.540
that I don't like about the nerds.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.540
But I think that's just alienation

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.540
and inflation. They can't do anything for the people.

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.540
So.

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.540
Geology.

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.540
No. Philosophers are so sexy

01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:28.540
that the will to profit against them

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.540
stinks like rotten eggs.

01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.540
Yes, definitely. Philosophy is really nice.

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:36.540
But...

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.540
It's just...

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:40.540
You can't earn your bread

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.540
with philosophy.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.540
Unless you're a really awesome...

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.540
David Garrett I almost said

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.540
Richard David Precht or something like that.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.540
Who sells books and always

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.540
holds himself in a camera because he's such a cool boy

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.540
and has a bunch of groups and can do marketing.

01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:56.540
People like that can live well with it.

01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.540
So a few freaks who live in the media

01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:00.540
can live well with their philosophy

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.540
or a few thinkers who

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.540
really

01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.540
stick out with their thoughts.

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.540
Otherwise you can do almost nothing with philosophy.

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:10.540
Those are the ones who arrived at the top

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.540
in the hierarchy. They can't grow higher

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.540
in their local snowball system

01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.540
as a philosopher. You could

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:18.540
at most become a Habeck-type.

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.540
He's also a philosopher. Then you'll become a chancellor.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:22.540
Or...

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.540
You just go around in some local

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.540
universities and you're lucky and get a job.

01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:28.540
But it's clear that it doesn't work with

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.540
everyone because there are way too many

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.540
graduates and way too few

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.540
applications for people like that.

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.540
You just have to do something else.

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.540
Of course you can say, I'm a writer

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.540
and a web designer and a philosopher

01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:42.540
academically. You've got a paper on it

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.540
and I've studied something and I'm doing something completely different.

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.540
That works. I'm also a physicist and I could

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.540
apply for everything. I could

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.540
become a consultant

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.540
or I could do something.

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.540
I could become a software representative.

01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:56.540
I could write offers

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:58.540
or sell something

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.540
or something like that. You could do

01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:02.540
everything. But as a

01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.540
philosopher

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:06.540
it's difficult to do something like that.

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.540
Hatred on money-elite

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.540
phyre KIZ

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.540
I eat rich.

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.540
A Christmas story

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.540
and the chocolate factory.

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.540
Is a Christmas story

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.540
some kind of family story

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.540
with these weird shit amis?

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.540
Could be.

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:44.540
Corona, however,

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.540
holds the record of the most

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.540
devoured brain areas.

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.540
I don't know. I would say

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:52.540
alcohol is quite good.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.540
And of course the normal

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.540
Infotainment mainstream.

01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.540
But it also destroys a lot of brain areas.

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:00.540
Especially with the children

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.540
that are growing up now.

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.540
If you grow up with two years

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.540
with a screen in front of your face

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.540
then you are too much

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.540
in your head with ten.

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:12.540
Nothing can develop cognitively.

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:18.540
Techno comes from Germany.

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:20.540
Sven Wett.

01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:22.540
The engineer

01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:24.540
is not so difficult.

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.540
Okay, I'll write that down for later.

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.540
Then I have it somewhere else.

01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:32.540
You never know.

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.540
Marosha Blümchen

01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.540
Okay, yes, I remember.

01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.540
Blümchen was hardcore techno, right?

01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:48.540
It was really upda upda.

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.540
Like a boom boom boom boom boom

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.540
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.540
Yes, that's right. That was funny.

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.540
But rather Gawa. Yes, definitely

01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.540
I am fully involved. If already, then already.

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.540
What comes to my mind

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:02.540
is Rotterdamer Terror Corpse.

01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:04.540
Does anyone know that?

01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:06.540
That was really hardcore in my opinion.

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.540
But that has to be like that

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.540
in the direction, right?

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.540
The university generation

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:16.540
Student course.

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:18.540
Which generation do you mean?

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.540
This university generation.

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:26.540
Well, he obviously means those who are currently studying.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.540
Right now, at this moment.

01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:30.540
So all those who were

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:32.540
matriculated at the latest

01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.540
five years ago

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.540
or are currently matriculated.

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:38.540
Function theory for every analysis

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.540
I'm doing right now and I find it mega exciting.

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:42.540
I also want to apply

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.540
and wanted to be an inventor since my childhood.

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.540
Yes, that's definitely a cool setting.

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:48.540
Then I wish you

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:50.540
that you find a good professor

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.540
with whom you can write

01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.540
real final work.

01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.540
I have the impression that this is a huge problem.

01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:58.540
Due to this massive alienation, people

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:00.540
no longer want to go out on serious topics

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.540
and struggle with teaching.

01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.540
But if you find something cool there

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.540
maybe in a company with an application

01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:08.540
that is often possible with engineers

01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:10.540
that you go to a company for which you work

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:12.540
they benefit from it.

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.540
You write a work about it. The professor is happy.

01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.540
It has something to do with applications.

01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.540
It is something unique. It is a real project

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.540
because it is unique and can not be repeated.

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.540
If you have fun with it, it is great.

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.540
The gain of knowledge is maximum

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.540
because you can apply your mathematical knowledge.

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.540
Morph. What does it look like

01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:34.540
with group talking?

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.540
That is brown and knocks against

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:38.540
what is brown and knocks against the glass?

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.540
I do not know.

01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.540
When I shit on your mother's face

01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.540
she then knocks against my glass

01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.540
and asks herself

01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:52.540
why did you do that?

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:06.540
Techno is not mine at all.

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.540
I do not know anything about it.

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:14.540
This is a rich man with the three ghosts.

01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:16.540
This is Ebenezer Scrooge.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.540
Ebenezer Scrooge.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.540
Then I arrived down here.

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.540
Then we can continue in the list.

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:28.540
Next film.

01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:30.540
I just saw it. It is called Eye for Eye.

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.540
Christian Bale main role

01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.540
and a lot of other great actors.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.540
The film is full of great actors

01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:38.540
such as Woody Harrelson

01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:40.540
aka natural born killers

01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:42.540
or

01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.540
Forest Whitaker

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.540
and super cool film.

01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.540
The film is so cool

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:52.540
because he

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.540
tells the story

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.540
a bit like Good Times

01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:00.540
on this lower income layer.

01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.540
Christian Bale is a worker

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:06.540
in a steel factory.

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.540
His father is just dying

01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.540
because of the impacts

01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:12.540
that he has had on the dams

01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.540
during his life in the steel factory.

01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.540
This is the context.

01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.540
He has to work

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:20.540
to get over the rounds.

01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:22.540
The metal factory

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:24.540
that he works in is going to be closed.

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:26.540
It is like a robot.

01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.540
There was prosperity

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.540
but it is gone now.

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.540
Everywhere everything is dirty.

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.540
Everything is shit and dirty.

01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:36.540
I also stand on it.

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:38.540
I stand on it when everything is dirty.

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.540
When I was in Istanbul

01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:42.540
it was great.

01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.540
I stood on it because everything was dirty.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:46.540
I walked around with my wife in Peking.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.540
Everything was dirty.

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:50.540
I stand on the big cities that are dirty.

01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:52.540
When it is dirty and shit

01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:54.540
you feel that there are still people

01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:56.540
who have a struggle

01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:58.540
and know how shitty life is.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.540
I feel much better

01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.540
when you sit in a bar

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.540
and eat the rotten fries

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.540
and see how people live there.

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.540
I think that is much more authentic

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.540
and you still feel life.

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:12.540
It is not like in Singapore

01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:14.540
or Dubai where everything is clean

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:16.540
and clean.

01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.540
We are in the upper 10%

01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:20.540
of the pyramid.

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.540
Everything is fine here.

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:24.540
You notice this difference

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:26.540
when you are somewhere.

01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.540
This difference is clear

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.540
in this movie.

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:32.540
Everything is dirty.

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:34.540
Christian Bale is a nice boy.

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.540
He is being sold.

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.540
He is being portrayed as a nice protagonist.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.540
He is an honorable man.

01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:42.540
He doesn't let himself be blamed.

01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:44.540
He works honestly for his money.

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.540
He has this attitude.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:48.540
He goes hunting.

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:50.540
But he doesn't kill the deer

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:52.540
because he doesn't like it.

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:54.540
He did that with the rifle.

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.540
But then he thinks he doesn't need to shoot.

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:58.540
He doesn't care.

01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:00.540
You notice that Christian Bale

01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:02.540
is a nice character.

01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:04.540
He is being portrayed.

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.540
You have to think about

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:08.540
what kind of a dude he is.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.540
He is not an aggro guy.

01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:12.540
But he knows how to defend himself

01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:14.540
against the fun he has.

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:16.540
Everything is great.

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.540
Then something happens.

01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:20.540
He drives

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.540
along a street

01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:24.540
and there is a bad exit.

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.540
Someone hits a car.

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.540
He kills a child

01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:30.540
or a mother, I don't know.

01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.540
He kills two people.

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:34.540
That's why he goes to jail.

01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.540
Then his life breaks.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.540
In the USA it is always on fire.

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.540
If you can't work for a month

01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:42.540
everything goes bad.

01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:44.540
No money, your wife disappears.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.540
He goes to jail.

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:48.540
His wife disappears.

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.540
His father dies by accident.

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:52.540
His brother

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.540
goes on the wrong track.

01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:56.540
His brother has a similar problem.

01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:58.540
He is poor, but he doesn't want to work in the steelworks.

01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.540
What does he do?

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:02.540
He goes to the army.

01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:04.540
That's the American dream.

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.540
Sell your life.

01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.540
He goes to the army.

01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:10.540
He is four times in Iraq.

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.540
He is traumatized.

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:14.540
He has post-traumatic stress disorder.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.540
He is really bad.

01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.540
The only thing he can do

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.540
when he comes back

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.540
is to call himself a prostitute.

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.540
But you don't call it that.

01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.540
You call it that.

01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:28.540
You do cage fights.

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:30.540
You fight with other boys.

01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:32.540
Then you go to sports.

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.540
There are fighters who beat you to death.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.540
It doesn't matter.

01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:38.540
Illegal fights.

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.540
Same thing as prostitution

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.540
on the male-male level.

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.540
The nice thing about the movie

01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.540
is that it is there again.

01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:52.540
It is presented as it is.

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.540
Everyone in this movie

01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.540
no matter if they are

01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.540
at the top of the hierarchy

01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:00.540
they all have an unhappy life.

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.540
They all lead an unhappy life.

01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:04.540
None of them can claim

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:06.540
that he is good at it.

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.540
Even Woody Harrelson

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.540
who is the craziest boy

01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.540
of all these motherfuckers

01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:14.540
who leads the freest life of all.

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:16.540
Even he is permanently

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:18.540
dissatisfied and pisses.

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.540
He has to take drugs all the time

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.540
because everything around him

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:24.540
is disgusting and disgusting.

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.540
And he himself is disgusting and disgusting.

01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.540
And that's just great.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.540
The movie is there again.

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.540
That's a movie where I say

01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:34.540
yes, wonderful.

01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.540
He puts his finger right in the wound.

01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.540
How shitty the world is

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.540
especially over there in the American dream.

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.540
I don't even know where it is.

01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.540
I think it's said Michigan or something.

01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:48.540
There must be exactly the situation

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.540
when the baby boomers were there

01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:52.540
and you could work hard for your

01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:54.540
life and so on.

01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:56.540
And now all the factories are closing

01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.540
and he also says in between

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:00.540
because it's cheaper in China to buy steel

01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.540
than to produce it here.

01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.540
And what always strikes me

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.540
when I see a movie like this

01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:08.540
that is now on the topic

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.540
is this debate

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.540
that is currently being led here

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:14.540
with the windmills because

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.540
they pollute our landscape.

01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:18.540
That's super ridiculous.

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:20.540
Fuck the landscape.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.540
There's a windmill.

01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.540
Do you have a problem that you can't

01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.540
draw a picture because it doesn't

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:28.540
look like it was 100 years ago?

01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.540
Our world is changing

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:32.540
and we as humans are changing our world.

01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.540
That's nothing new.

01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:36.540
And to put windmills there

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.540
is a weakness because of aesthetics.

01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.540
I never understood that.

01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:42.540
But the normal industrialization

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.540
makes it out of itself anyway.

01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:46.540
In the middle of nature, there's a

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.540
super cool valley, there are mountains,

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.540
everything could be super nice, but everywhere

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.540
are some rails laid, some

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.540
cobblestones, everything is super

01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:56.540
dirty, everything is some kind of fleece bands,

01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:58.540
everything looks shit, there's some metal

01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:00.540
scrap lying around everywhere, some shitty

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.540
cars that are no longer driven and so on.

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.540
And that is the normal degree

01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:06.540
of pollution that capitalism

01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.540
favors with our environment and our

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.540
nature. So talking about aesthetics

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.540
doesn't take place anyway and

01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:14.540
that's a good point.

01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.540
And of course,

01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.540
it's a revenge movie and I'm

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.540
totally against revenge movies because

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.540
it takes away my lowest instincts.

01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.540
Just because, of course,

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.540
Christian Bale's brother

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:28.540
is being killed

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:30.540
by Woody Harrelson because he's a

01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.540
stupid mafia wanker who says

01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.540
you owe me and I'll kill you all.

01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.540
And Woody Harrelson is generally

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.540
a crazy dude who kills everyone

01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.540
he doesn't want to kill anymore.

01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.540
Well, and Christian Bale

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.540
is a calm guy all the time

01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.540
but he has

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:48.540
enough of it and

01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.540
now he has to go through it

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:52.540
and he just makes him cold.

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:54.540
And that's a nice

01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:56.540
story. It's just a nice

01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.540
story about the

01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:00.540
situation that you actually ask yourself

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.540
what kind of choice do people have

01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:04.540
who are still living there?

01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:06.540
In what kind of world were they born

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.540
there? And that's the first world.

01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:10.540
There you should actually say

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:12.540
okay, there should actually be a

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:14.540
solidarity community that makes sure

01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:16.540
that people can become something else

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:18.540
apart from steel workers and drug dealers.

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:20.540
But that's being shown there

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.540
because the other option, the alternative

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.540
is to become a policeman and the drug

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:26.540
dealers and other spas just chase them.

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.540
What is not shown

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.540
is, so to speak, you could go to a

01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:32.540
university or something, but that just doesn't exist because

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:34.540
it's somewhere in the province. And of course

01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:36.540
everyone has this rotten idea

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.540
of homeland love and patriotism

01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:40.540
and work honestly

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:42.540
for your money and all this

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.540
work fetish that is being

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:46.540
poured into these Americans.

01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:48.540
All these contradictions

01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.540
are well represented in the film.

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.540
Even if the film doesn't directly

01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:54.540
address it. And that's why

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.540
I would say it's a good film about capitalism.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:08.540
Hmm...

01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:12.540
Yes, his beard already has a beard.

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.540
You're talking about some insiders, aren't you?

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:18.540
I can't start anything with them.

01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.540
I'm still in elementary school,

01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.540
so I still have a little bit

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:24.540
ahead of me, but I

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.540
will remember your words

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.540
and will look after a

01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.540
good professional or a good

01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.540
business. Yes, that

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.540
definitely has to be the case.

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.540
For the engineers, this is very important.

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.540
I would even say that

01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.540
this is the most important thing.

01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:42.540
That's where you make the most experience.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.540
Because

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:46.540
especially in engineering studies

01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:48.540
I've always had the impression that

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:50.540
the teaching...

01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:52.540
Okay,

01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.540
that can also be different from

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.540
university to university.

01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:58.540
It's probably better if you're at

01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.540
Humboldt University or Erlangen than

01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:02.540
if you're at a provincial university.

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:04.540
But still, especially because the

01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:06.540
engineering studies are

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.540
related to their practice,

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:10.540
this is of course important.

01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:12.540
And

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:14.540
among us, you learn the most.

01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.540
That's the only

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.540
time that you're really

01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:20.540
self-reliant and have to solve problems.

01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:22.540
At least that would be the best.

01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:24.540
That's the ideal case. You get a problem

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:26.540
that is so moderated that you can

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.540
create it yourself and then

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.540
solve it with mathematics.

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:32.540
For example,

01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:34.540
I had a friend who was

01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.540
in the university for a long time and

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:38.540
then studied electrical engineering.

01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:40.540
He's in the same situation now.

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.540
He's just doing that now

01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.540
at companies.

01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.540
And he's really getting into it.

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.540
I have the impression that

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.540
it's definitely much better than

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.540
studying 08.15 and then

01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:54.540
writing a good bachelor's degree.

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.540
Because I've seen that too.

01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.540
I see a lot of engineers

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:00.540
who are of course completely alienated.

01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.540
And I can't tell anyone that they're doing a good job afterwards.

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.540
They will only do a good job somewhere later.

01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:06.540
You know, they will do this experience

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.540
at most, if they're lucky,

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.540
after graduation. But you should actually

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.540
do that in your studies. You should experience it in your studies

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:14.540
alone to know

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:16.540
if that's actually something for you.

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:18.540
That's a kind of fireball.

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.540
And that's what belongs in an education.

01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:22.540
So that afterwards someone comes out

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.540
who can really

01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:26.540
go into a room

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:28.540
and say, hey,

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:30.540
I'm the crazy boy.

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.540
I can solve these problems.

01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:34.540
You're the management guys.

01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.540
You're the guy with the PR.

01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.540
You're the one who's the operator

01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:40.540
and calculates the numbers.

01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:42.540
But I'm doing the content here.

01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:44.540
I'm taking care of the content.

01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.540
That's what the engineer should be able to do.

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:48.540
And I have the impression that

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:50.540
there are far too few people

01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:52.540
who can still do that

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:54.540
after graduation.

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:56.540
But that's the way it is. And now in my

01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:58.540
support I see that quite often.

01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.540
I have about 50-50 students,

01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:02.540
50% students and 50% people

01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:04.540
who are at the university.

01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:06.540
And what can I say?

01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.540
They're almost all engineers, of course.

01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.540
I don't do math

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:12.540
because I can't do that

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:14.540
with the proofs and the words

01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:16.540
and the vocabulary, because I'm not a mathematician myself.

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:18.540
Only very rarely can I help with that.

01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.540
But otherwise

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.540
they're almost all engineers.

01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:24.540
I also have some financial problems,

01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:26.540
but I don't want to talk about them to the engineers.

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.540
Where did we end up?

01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.540
Next movie.

01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.540
The Drop Bargeld.

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.540
That's what it's called in German.

01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:48.540
The Drop Bargeld.

01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:50.540
And I also saw the movie last time.

01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.540
First of all, it's with Tom Hardy.

01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:54.540
That's great.

01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:56.540
He's with the guy from

01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:58.540
Sopranos.

01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:00.540
I think that's the same guy.

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:08.540
The movie is also

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:10.540
almost a

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.540
horror thriller, but

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:14.540
very different.

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.540
Tom Hardy

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:18.540
is the main character

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:20.540
and he lives in a city

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.540
and he works as a waiter.

01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:24.540
He does a very

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.540
simple job.

01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.540
And he doesn't want to have anything to do

01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:30.540
with the mafia,

01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:32.540
which is everywhere.

01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:34.540
And you notice all the time

01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:36.540
that he is

01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:38.540
someone who

01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:40.540
doesn't want to have anything to do with them,

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:42.540
but doesn't have a problem

01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.540
with it

01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:46.540
if he gets pissed,

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:48.540
that he could

01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.540
somehow finish the people.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.540
But he doesn't do it.

01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:54.540
He leaves it all behind.

01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.540
He doesn't try to have any interaction

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.540
with this parallel world,

01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:00.540
he just wants to earn money

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.540
and live, and he doesn't know

01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.540
what he wants to do.

01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:06.540
You have this feeling that he's up to something,

01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:08.540
but it's not said if he's up to something

01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.540
or if he doesn't know what he wants to do,

01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:12.540
but you are thrown into this setting.

01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:14.540
And then one day

01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.540
a dog in a trash can

01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:18.540
which wasn't meant for him

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:20.540
turns out to be

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:22.540
a complicated method

01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.540
of making a psycho into a troller.

01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:26.540
But he gets involved

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:28.540
in the story of a psycho

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.540
who wants to become a troller

01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.540
and he falls in love with the troller

01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.540
or the troller falls in love with him

01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:36.540
and then there is an interaction

01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.540
and the guy is a psycho

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.540
and a criminal and he

01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:42.540
threatens everyone with death.

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.540
And it's like this,

01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:48.540
the guy who owns the bar

01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:50.540
in which he works,

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.540
he has weird things going on

01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:54.540
and the bar is always used

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:56.540
as a drop.

01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:58.540
That means the mafia boys

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.540
somehow store money

01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.540
between them in the evening

01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:04.540
and then get it a few hours later.

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.540
So that some of the suppliers

01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:08.540
drop the money they made

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.540
through their drug sales

01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:12.540
and then someone else comes

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.540
and takes it away.

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:16.540
That's the model.

01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:18.540
I don't know if he gets some profit

01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.540
or if it's just money.

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:22.540
Anyway, this film lives in this world

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.540
and it's a side-effect

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.540
an interesting side-effect

01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:28.540
because it changes things a little bit.

01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:30.540
The guy tries

01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.540
to trick the mafia

01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:34.540
and you know it's a bad idea

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:36.540
and they really kick you out.

01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:38.540
The boy gets really pissed

01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:40.540
and it's a little bit Romanian

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.540
and it's also represented a little bit

01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.540
and a little bit of everyday racism

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.540
is also put in there, that's all funny.

01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:48.540
My cat is barking, I'll get her in.

01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:02.540
The nice thing about this film is

01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.540
Tom Hardy is,

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.540
we all know him,

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:08.540
he's the coolest Pumperboy

01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.540
who could destroy everyone in the world

01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:12.540
if he wanted to.

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:14.540
And you think all the time,

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.540
but that's Tom Hardy, why doesn't he destroy him?

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:18.540
But he doesn't.

01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:20.540
He's a very chill, very chill boy.

01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:24.540
At the end of the film

01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:26.540
there's a conflict

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:28.540
over a

01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:30.540
masculine

01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:32.540
boy-legend story

01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:34.540
that represents

01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.540
a big lie

01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:38.540
and he knows it all the time

01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:40.540
but he plays along

01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:42.540
because he really doesn't want

01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.540
to have anything to do with it.

01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:46.540
And the story comes out

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.540
that if he has to

01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:50.540
and is forced to,

01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.540
he pulls it through and makes people cold.

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.540
But you're not playing with the shit

01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.540
that's lying on the floor, are you?

01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.540
The cat gets annoyed,

01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.540
comes in

01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.540
and then gets annoyed on the floor.

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:12.540
I like that.

01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:14.540
Anyway, Tom Hardy

01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:16.540
turns out to be a really cool motherfucker

01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.540
at the end of the film,

01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:20.540
makes him cold, takes the princess with him

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.540
and happy end.

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:24.540
That's basically the story.

01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.540
And the cool thing is,

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.540
all the time there's a bully

01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:30.540
that he knows from church

01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:32.540
and he also has a funny role

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.540
but he can't do anything.

01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:36.540
He can only look at these mafia structures

01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:38.540
and somehow

01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.540
don't really intervene

01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.540
because it's clear, the bullies are powerless.

01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:44.540
And in the end, the bully

01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:46.540
also gives him the props

01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:48.540
because you're a really cool boy.

01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:50.540
And Tom Hardy of course doesn't say anything about it.

01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:52.540
And it's just

01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.540
all these structures

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.540
and also how the business runs

01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:58.540
because mafia is of course also just a business.

01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.540
It shows how these two parallel worlds work

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.540
and that's often the case

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:04.540
in these gangster films.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:06.540
That you have these parallel worlds

01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.540
where you have this bully world

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:10.540
that somehow does the legal way

01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:12.540
and there are also business models

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.540
included and there's corruption too.

01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:16.540
And then there's the complete

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:18.540
illegality where

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:20.540
mafia structures work exactly

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:22.540
according to the same scheme.

01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:24.540
The snowball system is always the same,

01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:26.540
you always have the same hierarchies,

01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.540
they're just called differently,

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.540
and then it's corrupt and

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.540
there's something going on and so on.

01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:34.540
It's always like that.

01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.540
It's always done like that.

01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.540
And that's why I think this film

01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:40.540
is so cool and that's why it talks about

01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:42.540
capitalism because

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.540
with the existence

01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:46.540
of these people

01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.540
it shows them,

01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:50.540
it shows how they live there

01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:52.540
under what conditions they live there

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:54.540
and also

01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:56.540
people like

01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:58.540
Tom Hardy

01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:00.540
can develop their own morals

01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:02.540
or a codex

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:04.540
according to which they can live.

01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:06.540
Life has made them tough, but they still have

01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:08.540
a moral codex. And many don't have that.

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:10.540
You have to imagine

01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:12.540
Tom Hardy is absolutely

01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:14.540
unique in how he's

01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:16.540
portrayed because a normal person

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:18.540
wouldn't behave like that. A normal person

01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.540
would have given up much earlier and would have been

01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:22.540
crushed. Tom Hardy is

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.540
portrayed as someone who has

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.540
a very high resilience,

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:28.540
a very high character strength

01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:30.540
compared to this external

01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.540
influence and

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:36.540
influence, so to speak, that

01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:38.540
influence him.

01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:40.540
And that shows how difficult it is,

01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:42.540
how difficult it is to grow up there and to act like that

01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:44.540
and to become an upright citizen or

01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:46.540
to do something great.

01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:48.540
What's going on with the cat? It's completely

01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.540
rusting out here, isn't it? It can't be crazy.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.540
What's going on?

01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:54.540
Emmy?

01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:58.540
Where are you?

01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:02.540
Do you want to get out?

01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.540
Yes, Departed is also a movie, of course.

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:16.540
By the way, Departed is

01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:18.540
a remake. You should all know that.

01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.540
The original

01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:22.540
movie is called Internal Fias

01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:24.540
and has more than one part.

01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:26.540
And we all

01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:28.540
got into it really well.

01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:30.540
And Departed is really

01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:32.540
copied one by one. It's a real,

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:34.540
real remake for the American market.

01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.540
Because of casualization.

01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:38.540
The people in the mainstream can't take

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:40.540
these Asian faces off. They can't.

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.540
Asian movies can't watch them,

01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:44.540
can they? They have a different

01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:46.540
gestic, they have a different habitus.

01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:48.540
You can't sell that to people.

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:50.540
And that's what Bo Jin Ho did

01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.540
really well with Snowpiercer, that he

01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:54.540
bought some Americans for it. Because

01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:56.540
otherwise he could never have such a success

01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:58.540
with the movie. With Snowpiercer.

01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.540
Because of this wickedness.

02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:02.540
People can't do that.

02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:04.540
I mean, people can't watch

02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.540
German or French or Spanish

02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:08.540
productions in peace. They get

02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:10.540
a scratch somehow. And for the American market

02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:12.540
it's not even there. They have to

02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:14.540
remake everything again.

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:16.540
And Departed is one of these remakes

02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.540
where everyone says, this is such a cool movie.

02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:20.540
But fuck you, dude. It's just a Korean movie.

02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:22.540
I think it's Korean.

02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:26.540
Infernal Envy, definitely.

02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:28.540
And as I said, not even that bad.

02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:30.540
Not even that bad.

02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:32.540
You know.

02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.540
And where we're already at, Asian movies.

02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:40.540
I Saw the Devil. Super movie.

02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:42.540
Then of course

02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:44.540
Oldboy. Of course it also has an American

02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:46.540
remake by now.

02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.540
Oldboy. Super strong movie.

02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:50.540
And what did we see last time?

02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:52.540
A really cool movie. I think

02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.540
The Audition.

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.540
Or

02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:58.540
Geständnisse. I still find that out.

02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:00.540
I still find that out.

02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:02.540
I quickly check

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:04.540
the movie pilots.

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.540
I quickly find that out.

02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.540
I just have to look at the first page.

02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:10.540
They are all very well rated by me.

02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.540
So, and

02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:14.540
So, and

02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:16.540
So, what did I have already?

02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:18.540
I Saw the Devil

02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:20.540
I Saw the Devil already.

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:22.540
Then

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:24.540
Oldboy, I already said that.

02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:26.540
Oldboy, I already said that.

02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:42.540
Infernal Enviers

02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:44.540
Infernal Enviers

02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.540
Infernal Enviers has a 9.5

02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.540
Infernal Enviers has a 9.5

02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.540
Departed also has a 9.5

02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:52.540
I see that Departed is

02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:54.540
USA and Hong Kong.

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.540
That means the Chinese

02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:58.540
added Hitler.

02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:00.540
They added some money to it.

02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:02.540
Adaption? No, that's not it.

02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:04.540
What does the movie

02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.540
Confessions

02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:08.540
Confessions mean?

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:10.540
So

02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.540
Confessions

02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:36.540
Oh no

02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:38.540
What is it?

02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:44.540
I think it's called Audition.

02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.540
The movie was

02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.540
really nice.

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.540
This is an Asian movie from Japan.

02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.540
I really liked it.

02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.540
Is that the one

02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:58.540
where the

02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.540
movie

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.540
movie

02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.540
movie

02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:06.540
movie

02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.540
movie

02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:10.540
movie

02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:12.540
nice but it's not the one

02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:14.540
I mean

02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:16.540
Woman, tell me if you are still

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:18.540
online. What was the name

02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:20.540
of the movie where the teacher

02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:22.540
claims she infected everyone with AIDS?

02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:26.540
What was the name?

02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:29.540
I thought it was called Confession.

02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:34.540
I have to search again.

02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:42.540
I think it was from Japan.

02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:07.540
No, that's not what it's called. I can't remember.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:11.540
I can't see it in my history.

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:13.540
The problem is, it's not compatible.

02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:18.540
Sometimes I didn't rate the movies.

02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:22.540
And then they're just gone.

02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:27.540
Then they disappeared in the Nirvana of Bits and Bytes.

02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:30.540
The movies.

02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:34.540
What was it called? It can't be.

02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:38.540
It was a Japanese movie.

02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:41.540
I'm just going to google it now.

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:44.540
Japanese movie.

02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.540
Woman puts on AIDS.

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:51.540
And then somehow confessions.

02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:52.540
Right.

02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:57.540
Japanese. The movie is called German title. Confessions from 2010.

02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:01.540
And then I just searched for it. Confessions or what?

02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:04.540
It can't be or what?

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.540
So.

02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:10.540
It comes right into the list.

02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:12.540
Confessions.

02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:15.540
No, no, it's not called Confessions. It's called...

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:16.540
Fuck.

02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:20.540
It's called Confessions. Original title. Koku Haku.

02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:23.540
This movie is really awesome.

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:27.540
I liked it. I gave it a new one. I just didn't find it.

02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:29.540
Confessions.

02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:32.540
No, it doesn't belong in the list.

02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:34.540
Because it's not a film about capitalism.

02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:36.540
I just wanted to show Asian movies.

02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:41.540
This movie is awesome. You can give it a try.

02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.540
So.

02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:46.540
And now...

02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:48.540
Where did we stop? White Drop.

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.540
Okay, I told you Tom Hardy.

02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:53.540
Next movie. Sorry to Bother You. I already told you about it.

02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:56.540
It's basically...

02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:58.540
Yeah.

02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:00.540
You have to watch it.

02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:04.540
It's a must-see like The Big Short and The Big Crash.

02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:06.540
It's a little bit funnier.

02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:12.540
But it has a lot more parts of the snowball system and capitalism than the others.

02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:17.540
It starts with Call Center and ends with the absolute creation of life.

02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:24.540
I think I talked about it in my video about mass animal husbandry and the exploitation of life through capitalism.

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:30.540
I think that's what I'm talking about because it's exactly in this direction. Human capital and so on.

02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:32.540
So what else do I have here? The shaft.

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:35.540
Well, I made an English video about the shaft.

02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:41.540
For me, the nice thing about the shaft is that this thing with the Monte Carlo simulation

02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:50.540
and the markets or, let's say, with the solution, with the spontaneous solidarity, is well represented.

02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:54.540
You could still discuss whether it's about capitalism or socialism.

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:58.540
But that doesn't matter. It's about hierarchies.

02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:02.540
And of course I would like to say that it's essentially about capitalism.

02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:05.540
The film is critical of capitalism.

02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.540
But you don't have to...

02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:14.540
It's basically about hierarchy criticism and how a society is built up in a world

02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:17.540
in which you can only imagine that there must be hierarchies.

02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:22.540
And whether you call it capitalism or socialism doesn't matter.

02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:25.540
I think that's well represented in the film.

02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:27.540
And of course it has a lot of funny aspects.

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.540
I made a long English video about it, about 20 minutes or so.

02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:35.540
If you can stand my English, you can give it to me because it's really disgusting.

02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:37.540
But I don't want to talk about it anymore.

02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:42.540
It's completely clear that this is a film that belongs in such a list.

02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.540
The next film.

02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:44.540
Rampage 2.

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:46.540
Capital punishment.

02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:48.540
I think all Rampage parts are great.

02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:51.540
They are by Uwe Boll and they are fantastic.

02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.540
The films are really just wonderful.

02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.540
I totally agree.

02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:59.540
And Rampage 2 is just super awesome because it's really about capitalism

02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:03.540
and how he wants to really destroy the establishment.

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:04.540
And it's just awesome.

02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:06.540
And I think Uwe Boll also plays himself.

02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:10.540
Or he plays some other film maker.

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:12.540
And it's just ...

02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:14.540
Ah yes.

02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:17.540
So of course you can guess Uwe Boll and hate him as you want.

02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:19.540
But I think this film is really awesome.

02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:20.540
I'm just on it.

02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:22.540
The next film.

02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:24.540
Good bless America.

02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:26.540
Super awesome film.

02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:30.540
It's not directly about capitalism or something.

02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:32.540
But it's about ...

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:40.540
... about media and about this fucked up American culture

02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:46.540
that at the end, after a hundred years, comes out of the people.

02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:48.540
A lot is being said about it.

02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:51.540
There is also this fetish that everyone always has to become younger.

02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:55.540
And that actually all are pedophiles because of their sexual ideals.

02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:57.540
Everyone wants to fuck a 14-year-old and so on.

02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:59.540
Everything is shown super well.

02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:03.540
That this whole cult and this whole beauty ideal is based on it.

02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:05.540
And ...

02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:11.540
I think in the end, they are in a talk show or in some evening show

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:12.540
and ...

02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:14.540
... they bang their heads a little bit.

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:16.540
That reminds a little bit of the end of Joker.

02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:20.540
But the film is also made a little funny at the beginning.

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:22.540
But it's just ... it's just wonderful.

02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:25.540
It's for people who are latent,

02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:27.540
what they have against this capitalist use of logic

02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:31.540
and this stupid culture of stupidity.

02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:32.540
It's wonderful.

02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.540
So everyone who likes idiocacy

02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:37.540
has to see God Bless America.

02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:41.540
These films are not the same,

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:44.540
but I have the impression that they belong together.

02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:47.540
So God Bless America.

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:49.540
Super cool film. I can only recommend it.

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:52.540
The next film on the list is known.

02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:53.540
The Wolf of Wall Street.

02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:55.540
I don't need to say anything about it.

02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.540
It's a great film.

02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:58.540
It's just fantastic.

02:09:58.540 --> 02:09:59.540
Especially the end.

02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:02.540
The end is really premium.

02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:03.540
The whole film is premium.

02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:04.540
Don't get me wrong.

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:05.540
The film is super cool.

02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:06.540
But the end.

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:10.540
How he holds these workshops, these lectures

02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:11.540
with the pen.

02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:13.540
How do I sell the pen to people and so on.

02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:15.540
And the camera perspective.

02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:18.540
How the audience is filmed, so to speak.

02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:20.540
And how everyone actually goes down on these guys

02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:22.540
with the success and so on.

02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:23.540
That's great.

02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:25.540
The film has several layers of interpretation

02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.540
and they are all fantastic.

02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:29.540
Super cool film.

02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:31.540
I don't need to say anything more.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:33.540
Next film.

02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:35.540
Falling Down.

02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:36.540
A normal day.

02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:39.540
Now you ask yourself, what does it have to do with capitalism?

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:41.540
The film is only about capitalism.

02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:47.540
Michael Douglas comes to a few stations of his life

02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:48.540
in the film.

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:51.540
And again and again he asks questions.

02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:52.540
Why is it like this?

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:53.540
Why is it like this?

02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:55.540
Why is it so shitty here?

02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:56.540
Why don't you do it like this?

02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:58.540
And the answer is always capitalism.

02:10:58.540 --> 02:10:59.540
But he doesn't see it.

02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:03.540
Because for a while he himself in this cold war

02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:06.540
in this ideology that the Americans are the best.

02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:07.540
And that he is a patriot.

02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:09.540
And that he would do everything for his country and so on.

02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:12.540
I think he also worked at the CIA as an engineer

02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:13.540
or something like that.

02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:15.540
And he sacrificed himself for his country.

02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:17.540
But no one gives a fuck about it.

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.540
And in the end it's all a big joke.

02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:22.540
And of course he also has a huge psychosis.

02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:24.540
He beats his wife and everything is shit.

02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:25.540
And he is not understood.

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:28.540
He doesn't feel valued.

02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:32.540
And there is this super cool scene

02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:34.540
also with the Nazi in this store.

02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:36.540
Where he says to the Nazi

02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:39.540
we are not friends and you are not an American.

02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:41.540
You are just an asshole.

02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:45.540
And that is a wonderful scene.

02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:50.540
Because he doesn't see himself that way.

02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:53.540
He doesn't see that he also behaves racistically.

02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:56.540
Or even better, that capitalism

02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:59.540
strengthens these racist tendencies.

02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:04.540
Whereas he himself is not racist.

02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:07.540
He also tells this Asian in the store

02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:09.540
that he is just a fucking faggot

02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:11.540
and that the coke is so expensive.

02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:13.540
And so he completely rages.

02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:16.540
And I don't even know how it was.

02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:20.540
But of course he throws some racist words at his head.

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:22.540
But he just does that because

02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.540
he doesn't want to be in his culture

02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:26.540
because he is a racist.

02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:28.540
And the other guy is a real racist.

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:30.540
And he also has something against whores.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:32.540
And he sits in his leather shop

02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:35.540
with the military stuff and the tank fist and so on.

02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:37.540
And all this nonsense.

02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:40.540
And then he clearly limits himself.

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:42.540
And says, no, wait a minute, that's me.

02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:44.540
But I'm not. I'm a real American

02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:46.540
and we are really crazy here.

02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:48.540
We are the Americans, we don't need that.

02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:50.540
This whole film actually shows everyone

02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:52.540
all these contradictions of capitalism

02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:54.540
and above all this western culture

02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:56.540
which was highly stylized there.

02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:58.540
Especially at the time, the film is already 20, 30 years old.

02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:00.540
It is shown super cool.

02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:02.540
And above all it is shown

02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:04.540
why the conservatives and the AFD

02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:06.540
why they are so to speak strong.

02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:08.540
Because people like Michael Douglas

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:10.540
they don't see the problem.

02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:12.540
They only see symptoms.

02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:14.540
And Michael Douglas is not able

02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:16.540
to do a system analysis.

02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:18.540
He goes over this golf course,

02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:20.540
he completely rubs off

02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.540
that these damn yuppie wankers

02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:24.540
No, they are not yuppies.

02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:26.540
No, they are some old rich sacks.

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:28.540
It doesn't matter. He rubs off completely

02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:30.540
that this is not a public park.

02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:32.540
You think, what is this supposed to be?

02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:34.540
Why is there a fence around here?

02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:36.540
What kind of wankers are you?

02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.540
This fence should be accessible to the public,

02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:40.540
this park should be accessible.

02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:42.540
And you are pissing yourselves off with your golf.

02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:44.540
This can't be true. Shit.

02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:46.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:48.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:50.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:52.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:54.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:56.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:58.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:02.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:14:02.540 --> 02:14:04.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:06.540

02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:14.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:16.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:18.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:20.540

And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:48.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:50.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:52.540

And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:58.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:00.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:02.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:04.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:06.540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:08.540
Oh, and by the way,

02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.540
now I remember another movie,

02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:12.540
which definitely has to be on the list.

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:14.540
I, Daniel Blake, also has to be on the list.

02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:18.540
It's also an awful movie,

02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:20.540
we'll talk about that in a moment.

02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:24.540
Yes, and Michael Douglas.

02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:26.540
Yes, and Michael Douglas.

02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:28.540
It's just great.

02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:30.540
First of all, of course, great actor.

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:32.540
And he fits in really well.

02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:34.540
And then the end with his daughter and so on.

02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:36.540
The bully.

02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:38.540
The bully who is always behind him.

02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:40.540
He is one day before the pension.

02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:42.540
He could just lie back and say

02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:44.540
fuck it, but no.

02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:46.540
He is an honest man.

02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:48.540
And his wife at home

02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:50.540
only makes him stress and he doesn't want to go home at all.

02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:52.540
That's why he would rather work.

02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:54.540
But he only has colleagues who piss him off

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:56.540
and who don't follow him.

02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:58.540
He is the only one who takes his job seriously.

02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:00.540
And he is a really nice boy.

02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:02.540
Who just wants the best for everyone.

02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:04.540
And he gets really pissed off by the system.

02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:06.540
You notice that too.

02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:08.540
And that's so funny, because

02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.540
both protagonists, this old cracker,

02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:12.540
the bully and Michael Douglas,

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:14.540
the old cracker

02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:16.540
could also have a bad day

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:18.540
and completely freak out.

02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:20.540
And he is really just being fucked up

02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.540
on his job and he is also doing great shit.

02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:24.540
But he has the resilience

02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:26.540
and this goodwill.

02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:28.540
And Michael Douglas doesn't have that anymore.

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:30.540
This is the dualism

02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:32.540
of these two people.

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.540
How they meet at the end and talk about

02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:36.540
things they can't do.

02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:38.540
And then of course he beats him up.

02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:40.540
I think he beats him up at the end.

02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:42.540
And then the movie is over.

02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:44.540
And it's all super tragic.

02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.540
The movie is lovely.

02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.540
And in my opinion it's all about

02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:50.540
capitalism in the movie.

02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:02.540
So...

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.540
What are the boys writing here?

02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:12.540
The question is, how do I recognize

02:18:12.540 --> 02:18:14.540
a good prof, what is a good topic

02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:16.540
for the final work. Yes, that is difficult of course.

02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:18.540
So you should first

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:20.540
go after whether the topic

02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:22.540
sounds interesting to you.

02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:24.540
Intuitively. Whether you think that is an interesting topic.

02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:26.540
That is the most important thing.

02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.540
If you, after the pitch meeting,

02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:30.540
after the first three minutes,

02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:32.540
think that is an interesting topic.

02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:34.540
Or that is an important topic

02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:36.540
for the industry,

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:38.540
for the society.

02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:40.540
Or just an academically interesting topic.

02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:42.540
One that challenges you mentally.

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:44.540
Where you think, oh that is a cool problem.

02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:46.540
And I can already imagine how to solve that.

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:48.540
I am interested in

02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:50.540
solving that. Because usually

02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:52.540
it becomes much more difficult in detail

02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:54.540
and then turns out to be completely different.

02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:56.540
But that doesn't matter. You then have this motivation

02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:58.540
to fight through it.

02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:00.540
That is always the case.

02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:02.540
That would be a good occasion.

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:04.540
That you say, that is a cool topic.

02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:06.540
I don't know how it works at your university,

02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:08.540
but typically it was like that.

02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:10.540
You go to a prof and say, what topics do you have?

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:12.540
Then he has a catalog of topics there.

02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:14.540
And then you look at them.

02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:16.540
Or you have a friend

02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:18.540
or you know an engineering company

02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:20.540
that would do something like that.

02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:22.540
And then you can go to the prof and say,

02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:24.540
I have someone here who would do that with me.

02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:26.540
And then you can build a connection in that direction as well.

02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:28.540
That is actually all relatively chill at the university.

02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:32.540
If you find something like that.

02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:34.540
The worst are the 0815 topics.

02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:38.540
Like, measure here

02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.540
and write a protocol about it.

02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:42.540
And that is your job.

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:44.540
That is a well-earned note.

02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:46.540
And that is how they lure people.

02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:48.540
Well-earned notes. But you learn almost nothing.

02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:50.540
That is alien.

02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:52.540
Nobody cares about your results.

02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:54.540
And sometimes

02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.540
it is like that

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.540
that these quests are

02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.540
a real dead-end in my opinion.

02:20:00.540 --> 02:20:02.540
That does not lead to anything.

02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:04.540
You miss something

02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:06.540
and then nobody cares

02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:08.540
and then it is just shit.

02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:10.540
Much better is that you have a concrete problem

02:20:10.540 --> 02:20:12.540
and you have to solve it.

02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:14.540
Let's say you have a machine

02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:16.540
that has an output

02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:18.540
and you have another machine

02:20:18.540 --> 02:20:20.540
and they have to be connected

02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:22.540
and you have to automate something.

02:20:22.540 --> 02:20:24.540
You have to optimize a process

02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:26.540
or you have to understand

02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:28.540
that the interface works

02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:30.540
and that the machines can communicate with each other.

02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:32.540
Something like that.

02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:34.540
A typical engineer's topic.

02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:36.540
That is actually cool.

02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:38.540
And you learn a lot.

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.540
You learn something for practice.

02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:42.540
Bus systems,

02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:44.540
you have other protocols.

02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.540
In general, you learn something about IT.

02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:48.540
That comes next.

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.540
That is an engineer

02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:52.540
who is the most general

02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:54.540
of those people who are in practice

02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:56.540
can think outside of the box.

02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:58.540
I do not want to force you to become a programmer

02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:00.540
but I want to make it clear

02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:02.540
that if you have something like that

02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:04.540
where machines have protocols

02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:06.540
where you have to think about

02:21:06.540 --> 02:21:08.540
how that works

02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:10.540
how signals are processed

02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:12.540
then you have to think about

02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:14.540
how the world works.

02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:16.540
That is much better and that brings a lot more.

02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:18.540
What is written on your paper

02:21:18.540 --> 02:21:20.540
that is completely irrelevant

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:22.540
because the heart attack is so strong

02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.540
that everyone already knows that.

02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.540
The companies of today see that everywhere.

02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:28.540
If you can say in a meeting

02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:30.540
I have clarified this and that

02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:32.540
because I am crazy and I put it on me

02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:34.540
and besides, lol

02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:36.540
then it brings a lot more

02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:38.540
because you then go in with your

02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:40.540
inflated young man's breast

02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:42.540
and say I'm the crazy boy.

02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:44.540
That is the elegance that you have to have.

02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:46.540
As a physicist, for example, I always have it.

02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:50.540
That is the Jedi sword

02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:52.540
that I got with my diploma

02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:54.540
that I imagine myself

02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:56.540
I am so crazy.

02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:58.540
With such an elegance

02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:00.540
if you go somewhere like that

02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:02.540
and say you are the crazy boy

02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:04.540
of course people can also think

02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:06.540
what kind of a fucking asshole is that

02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:08.540
but of course you have to pack it like that

02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:10.540
that you are just self-confident.

02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:12.540
That is the most important thing.

02:22:12.540 --> 02:22:14.540
That's how it is with the wedding show too.

02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:16.540
If you make it clear to the woman

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:18.540
that you are a crazy boy

02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:20.540
and that you are just self-confident

02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:22.540
you get the ices.

02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:24.540
You have to shine it out.

02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:26.540
And that only works if you really understand

02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:28.540
and stand behind it.

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:30.540
If you stand on a piece of paper

02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:32.540
that you are a great engineer

02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:34.540
but you know that what you did there is not worth anything

02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:36.540
then it is difficult

02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:38.540
to act authentically.

02:22:38.540 --> 02:22:40.540
At least that's my impression.

02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:42.540
At least that's my impression.

02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:44.540
That people can't do that.

02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:46.540
The worst are the guys who think they are the best

02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:48.540
but they can't do anything.

02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:50.540
Because those are the guys

02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.540
you ask yourself a question.

02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:54.540
I already had conversations with such people.

02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:56.540
You ask yourself a very simple question.

02:22:56.540 --> 02:22:58.540
What does the Fourier transformation

02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:00.540
of Cosinus look like?

02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:02.540
And then they can't do that.

02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:06.540
And I can only laugh at them

02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:08.540
how ridiculous that is.

02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:10.540
People like that can go to hell.

02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:16.540
I stopped doing Mechatronics

02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:18.540
and then I worked as a car mechanic.

02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:20.540
I stopped doing Mechatronics

02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:22.540
and then I worked as a car mechanic.

02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:24.540
Yes, of course.

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:26.540
Why not?

02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:28.540
It could be.

02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:30.540
It always depends on the personality.

02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:32.540
For some it would be better to do it later.

02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:34.540
For some it is good

02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:36.540
if they do a few years of training.

02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.540
First training, then studies

02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:40.540
or going to the club or whatever.

02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:42.540
That would be a classic thing

02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:44.540
like what my buddy did.

02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:46.540
He was in the club for 6, 7 or 8 years.

02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:48.540
But he didn't want to go to the juice shop anymore.

02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:50.540
And then he got out

02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:52.540
of the good job he had.

02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:54.540
He was safe.

02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:56.540
He went out and decided for a happy student life

02:23:56.540 --> 02:23:58.540
with little money.

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:00.540
Just because he found it so disgusting.

02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:04.540
And now he is still in his job

02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:06.540
and has to do a lot more.

02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:08.540
He decided to do it

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:10.540
just because he found it better.

02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:12.540
Because it is something that

02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:14.540
makes him feel closer to himself.

02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:16.540
Less alienation.

02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:18.540
But looking back

02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:20.540
you could

02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:22.540
start studying again.

02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:24.540
You just have to find

02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:26.540
a way to do it in parallel

02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:28.540
with the university.

02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:30.540
Or to take an education credit

02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:32.540
and do it again.

02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:34.540
I don't know how it is with BAföG.

02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:36.540
If you are 25 now, you will still get BAföG.

02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:38.540
I think BAföG goes up to 30.

02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:40.540
Or does it go up to 25?

02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:42.540
I don't know.

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:44.540
You have to work on it.

02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:46.540
Why not study now?

02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:58.540
Unfortunately, Titanic

02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:00.540
scared me so much. Blood diamond was the first film

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:02.540
that I wanted to watch.

02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:04.540
But that is funny because

02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:06.540
Leonardo DiCaprio

02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:08.540
except for Titanic

02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:10.540
only made good movies.

02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:12.540
He is also a kind of Robert Pattinson.

02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:14.540
He was crazy before.

02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.540
He made many good movies before.

02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:18.540
He has the Streets of New York

02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:20.540
or something like that.

02:25:20.540 --> 02:25:22.540
I don't remember his name.

02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:24.540
He was very young.

02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:26.540
Then also films like The Beach.

02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:28.540
Super cool film.

02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:30.540
DiCaprio made a lot of

02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:32.540
really good movies.

02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:34.540
And Titanic was...

02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:36.540
I grew up with it too.

02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:38.540
That is the Titanic.

02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:40.540
What kind of shit movie is that?

02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:42.540
According to the motto.

02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:44.540
He makes a love-homo movie.

02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:46.540
He should fuck with his dick stuff.

02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:48.540
Sure, that is the mainstream

02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:50.540
attitude you get.

02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:52.540
But as soon as you have seen The Beach

02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:54.540
or James Carroll

02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:56.540
was his name.

02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:58.540
Jim Carroll?

02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:00.540
Streets of New York or something like that?

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:02.540
One of the first movies.

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:04.540
Only good movies.

02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:06.540
Leonardo DiCaprio made almost only good movies.

02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:14.540
Yes, that is good

02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:16.540
if it is valued on programming

02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.540
and signal processing.

02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:20.540
Because that is actually

02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:22.540
an engineer who does not do that.

02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:24.540
Or who does not develop

02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:26.540
any interest for development.

02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:28.540
He is a boomer.

02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:30.540
He lives on a dying branch.

02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:32.540
That is clear.

02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:34.540
Especially because the engineer

02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:36.540
represents the interface between

02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:38.540
a real, normal mechanic

02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:40.540
and an academic physicist.

02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:42.540
That is someone who has the practical

02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:44.540
relationship but still understands

02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:46.540
the theoretical basics.

02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:48.540
At least as far as he needs it

02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:50.540
for his problem solving.

02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:52.540
It is clear that you cannot

02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:54.540
say that the L2-norm

02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:56.540
of the function

02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:58.540
is smaller than infinite.

02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:00.540
That is not expected from you.

02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:02.540
You are expected to understand

02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:04.540
these things with mathematics

02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:06.540
so far as to correctly

02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:08.540
classify and solve the problems.

02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:14.540
By the way, you can write me an email.

02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:16.540
I like to help people

02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:18.540
who are in such a situation.

02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:20.540
Because I know myself quite well.

02:27:20.540 --> 02:27:22.540
Especially with mathematics.

02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:26.540
And if someone is a well-paid

02:27:26.540 --> 02:27:28.540
employee of Antifa GmbH

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:30.540
then I already have

02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:32.540
a kind of house-sympathy.

02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:36.540
To be honest, I did not know

02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:38.540
what an in-study

02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.540
should bring me.

02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:42.540
Well, if you say

02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:44.540
what did you do?

02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.540
You worked at a car dealer.

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:48.540
That means you have a lot of practice.

02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:50.540
Practice, I assume.

02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:52.540
The nice thing about

02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.540
an academic career is

02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:56.540
the academic

02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:58.540
elegance that comes with it.

02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:00.540
And I do not mean

02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:02.540
that an elitist pisser

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.540
comes out of it

02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:06.540
and raises you

02:28:06.540 --> 02:28:08.540
to another level.

02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:10.540
Because you see

02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:12.540
certain things

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:14.540
from a different perspective.

02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:16.540
You cannot underestimate

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:18.540
what that brings.

02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:20.540
It brings a lot.

02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:22.540
Studying, if you do it

02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:24.540
because you feel like it.

02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:26.540
I am not talking about all those

02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:28.540
weirdos who make inflation

02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:30.540
and just want a piece of paper

02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:32.540
so that they are hired at a bank

02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:34.540
or get a boss position in a

02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:36.540
bureaucratic office.

02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:38.540
I am talking about

02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:40.540
people who are interested in content.

02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:42.540
And if you say you worked at a car dealer

02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:44.540
then I assume you have

02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:46.540
a lot of experience.

02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:48.540
You know the numbers.

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:50.540
You know the mechanics.

02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:52.540
But first of all

02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:54.540
I would say that the car

02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:56.540
with the combustion engine

02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:58.540
is a story

02:28:58.540 --> 02:29:00.540
that is on the dying branch.

02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:02.540
But on the other hand

02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:04.540
there is much more to discover.

02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:06.540
The engineering studio is

02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:08.540
a window into a different world.

02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.540
You have this application

02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:12.540
in your head.

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:14.540
That is mostly the case.

02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:16.540
As an engineer you want

02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:18.540
to install a milling machine

02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:20.540
or you want to become a sports technician

02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:22.540
and build fitness equipment.

02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:24.540
It does not matter.

02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:26.540
You have an idea of what you want to do.

02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:28.540
And that is not a problem.

02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:30.540
The nice thing is that

02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:32.540
through the academic input

02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:34.540
that you get

02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:36.540
I would say

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:38.540
you see

02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:40.540
how it is with modular thinking

02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:42.540
and abstract thinking.

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.540
That is

02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:46.540
an awesome intellectual

02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:48.540
level up.

02:29:48.540 --> 02:29:50.540
And nobody can steal it from you.

02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:52.540
That is super powerful.

02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:54.540
You feel much better afterwards.

02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:56.540
It is just

02:29:56.540 --> 02:29:58.540
I do not get it wrong.

02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:00.540
I want the activity

02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:02.540
of normal people

02:30:02.540 --> 02:30:04.540
who did not go to university

02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:06.540
and did something right.

02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:08.540
I do not want to talk about that.

02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:10.540
As a physicist

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:12.540
I did computer-oriented

02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:14.540
theoretical physics

02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:16.540
in my graduate school.

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.540
I am far away from the practice.

02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:20.540
But I still see that

02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:22.540
in engineers.

02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:24.540
I know engineers

02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:26.540
who are teaching

02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:28.540
or doing engineering activities

02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:30.540
and they are crying

02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:32.540
how terrible it is

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:34.540
to deal with students

02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:36.540
who are only affected by inflation

02:30:36.540 --> 02:30:38.540
and so on.

02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:40.540
If you want

02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:42.540
to do something like that

02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:44.540
then do it.

02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:46.540
If you do not want to do it

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:48.540
then do it.

02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:50.540
If you are interested

02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:52.540
in the content

02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:54.540
and you learn a lot

02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:56.540
even in the inflation

02:30:56.540 --> 02:30:58.540
you can learn a lot.

02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:00.540
It is not used anymore.

02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:02.540
You have to do

02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:04.540
30-25%

02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:06.540
of the content.

02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:08.540
But you can do 80%.

02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:10.540
Nobody can forbid that.

02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.540
And nobody can forbid

02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:14.540
you to do

02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:16.540
secondary literature

02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:18.540
if you are interested.

02:31:18.540 --> 02:31:20.540
Maybe not statistical physics

02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:22.540
but only theoretical mechanics.

02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:30.540
It is a nice excursion

02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:32.540
if you have the luxury

02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:34.540
to do something like that.

02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:36.540
I can only recommend it to everyone.

02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:38.540
I think it is a real enrichment.

02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:40.540
It really helps

02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:42.540
to create something.

02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:44.540
You can find my e-mail address

02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:46.540
on the channel.

02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:48.540
In the YouTube interface.

02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:50.540
Channel info.

02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:56.540
I am going to get a beer

02:31:56.540 --> 02:31:58.540
and turn on the music.

02:31:58.540 --> 02:32:00.540
We said

02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:02.540
hard and relaxed.

02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:04.540
Hard and relaxed.

02:32:04.540 --> 02:32:06.540
Hard and relaxed.

02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:08.540
I am thinking about

02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:10.540
what would be good.

02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:12.540
Let me think.

02:32:16.540 --> 02:32:18.540
Hard and relaxed.

02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:22.540
No.

02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:24.540
Maybe.

02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:28.540
I have a good idea.

02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:30.540
Hard and relaxed.

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.540
See you soon.

02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.540
Thank you.

02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:30.540
Thank you.

02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:00.540
Thank you.

02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:30.540
Thank you.

02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:00.540
Thank you.

02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:30.540
Thank you.

02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:00.540
Thank you.
