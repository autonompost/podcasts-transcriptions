255540	258540	We're going to turn off the song, sleepy, and then we're off...
288540	295540	You know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,
319540	326540	you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,
332540	339540	you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,
348540	355540	you know what, you know what, you know what.
378540	385540	You know what, you know what, you know what.
498540	511540	So, I'll explain it to you. I sat at the computer earlier, played a bit, the girls were out
511540	516540	and the woman called and said, should I buy you beer? We are just shopping. I'll bring you
516540	522540	beer. Tell me which beer. And it turned out that we were grilling. So I thought, cool,
522540	527540	we're grilling. But that means I'm drinking beer and that means I won't play after that
527540	532540	because if I'm drunk or just drunk, I can't play anymore. I'm taking it seriously.
532540	537540	I have a delay, then I can't react anymore and that's why I can't do it. So I thought,
537540	542540	I'll look at the debate battle at the competition anyway and I'll drink a beer anyway
542540	547540	because we're grilling. And I did this on the beamer in the living room. That means my wife
547540	552540	pulled it in and so on. Super funny. And then I thought, fuck it, do a live stream.
552540	559540	And I always wanted to do something quick anyway, like a few capitalism films
559540	564540	that are running under the radar that no one knows. First thing, in the video description
564540	569540	you have to find a link to a movie pilot list. If you can't see it, then you have to
569540	576540	make a fun account. Make yourself a fun account or log in with some junk,
576540	582540	with some social media. It should work. Then you can see the list. And I just
582540	586540	clicked them together. That means I will certainly have forgotten films that are super nice.
586540	591540	And if you can think of good films that talk about capitalism, and it's not especially
591540	595540	films like The Big Short that are obvious or Wolf of Wall Street, where that is completely clear,
595540	598540	but films where it may not be completely clear that they talk about capitalism.
598540	603540	These films are especially interesting. And yes, I have now prepared the list
603540	608540	and we'll just go through it. And as I said, if you come up with something, just write it
608540	616540	in the comments. The chat is now there. So, and before it starts, terms like capitalism
616540	621540	are bubbles on a string. The string is the well-known red thread. Such definitions
621540	632540	I see. You're in a good mood today. You have a beer, you have a spade, and that's why
632540	636540	you're making really clever speeches here. I notice that. Okay, no problem. I'll start.
636540	641540	I think I've talked about Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt before. The film is really
641540	647540	wonderful, because the film is actually the perfect thing, in my opinion, about the films
647540	653540	that I actually want to talk about here. The film was sold back then as a mafia film.
653540	659540	He also only had the actors, for example the guys from the Sopranos. He had these typical
659540	665540	mobster mafia situations. And so was the trailer and so was the poster. So the film was
665540	670540	marketed. And everyone went into the movies and then expected a mafia film. And it was
670540	675540	not a classic mafia film. Everyone was already pissed off and the film also got super
675540	680540	bad reviews because everyone was just disappointed. And I'll tell you, I didn't know
680540	685540	the film and I didn't notice the advertising back then. I only saw it a few months ago.
685540	690540	And I was totally surprised. First of all, the film is also produced by Wood Pitt and
690540	698540	the film is about capitalism. So this setting, this mafia setting that is
698540	704540	embodied there, that's just a make-up artist. That's just a marketing strategy for the
704540	710540	film. But on the other hand, it's an extremely good metaphor. It's about capitalism.
710540	716540	And the nice thing is, Brad Pitt himself plays the main role and he embodies capitalism.
716540	722540	He embodies, in my opinion, all contradictions of capitalism. He has them in him.
722540	726540	So first of all, it's of course Brad Pitt. He looks super cool, he runs around, he's super
726540	731540	clean, he talks all the time and so on. And he just does it as if he were really serious.
731540	736540	And he just wants to, so he's an order killer and he just does his business with killing.
736540	740540	And that's not a problem at all. Morality doesn't play a role in the film at all.
740540	745540	That's really cool. That's what it's about, not at all. But he is constantly
745540	751540	confronted with the fact that his business also leads to things that
751540	756540	piss him off. And that's just funny. And the film is really just elegant and
756540	761540	very nicely done. Especially the first scenes are really dirty and you can see
761540	767540	how it is when you stand in the bottom of the pyramid in the USA. There is no solidarity.
767540	773540	Natural Born Chaos, yes. Very good idea. I'll add it right away.
780540	783540	If my wife was in the chat now, she would have said that a long time ago.
783540	788540	This is my wife's favorite film. In any case, a really good film because he
788540	793540	refers really well to how it is with the media and with the feedback loops.
793540	798540	And above all, he is already so old and yet the film is still completely accurate.
798540	802540	So, Killings in Softly. And that's for example the guy from the Sopranos.
802540	807540	He plays an aging order killer and he should do the job. And he should do the job
807540	811540	only because he wants to kill someone because Brad Pitt doesn't want to do it himself.
811540	815540	He somehow knows the victim so half and he actually didn't want to be pulled in
815540	820540	and that's just too emotional. And he would rather do an alienated business where
820540	825540	he is far away from the content. He doesn't want to argue about content. He just wants
825540	830540	to make a business decision. And then he gets a Sopranos man and he is
830540	833540	already completely over the mountain. So he doesn't want to do his job anymore.
833540	836540	He doesn't want to do anything anymore. He is completely alienated from the world.
836540	840540	He actually just wants to use alcohol. And that is no longer fun for him.
840540	844540	And he meets him in a hotel lobby and he is already badly reprimanded because the guy is
844540	848540	so fat and old and shit and he doesn't want to do it anymore and he is just drunk.
848540	853540	And Brad Pitt tries to get him to do the job and in the end he doesn't do it.
853540	858540	And then Brad Pitt has to do it himself and all that. And that's all totally awesome.
858540	863540	Super nice. And the best thing about the film. So first of all, this whole mess,
863540	868540	how it gets there. The actors are great. The whole excessive violence that is
868540	873540	shown in the film. It is really not fetishizing at all.
873540	877540	It is not like you would expect in a normal gangster movie.
877540	882540	Really masculine, really cool scenes where someone shoots you in the head with a
882540	886540	gun or something. Or where someone beats you up really hard. Yes, there is that.
886540	891540	But they are shown the way they are. Just raw and bloody.
891540	896540	I am actually used to raw violence in films and bloody films.
896540	901540	Nevertheless, I had this feeling when watching the film that this is just not an
901540	906540	aesthetic scene. It is just disgusting. It just resists you because the violence is
906540	911540	shown so realistically. And you really think, oh, does that have to be now?
911540	916540	Do they have to do that now? That's shit. And so on and so on.
916540	921540	And believe me, I have already seen a lot of films. It is not that I am
921540	926540	somehow surrounded by violence and that is why I am not good at it.
926540	931540	And that is wonderful. And of course all the actors are great.
931540	936540	And also all the little characters that are in it.
936540	941540	In my opinion, this is also a metaphor for the hype on the market place.
942540	947540	There are many small actors and that doesn't matter at all.
947540	950540	They will be irrelevant at some point. All the stories of the actors don't matter at some point.
950540	954540	At some point it's just about Brad Pitt and his business and whether he ends the quest
954540	959540	properly or not. And at the end of the film, that is really the best, the end,
959540	964540	the last 2-3 minutes, he is sitting there with the guy with whom he shot the deal
964540	969540	and so on. He was supposed to finish the job.
969540	974540	And somehow he gets less money. He gets beaten up for the money.
974540	979540	And in the background, Obama is running because there is a election campaign.
979540	984540	We are a big nation, we are a community, we all belong together. Come together, people.
984540	989540	And Brad Pitt doesn't have to come out at all and laugh how ridiculous that is.
989540	994540	Because he says, no, wait a minute, the USA is not a country. We are not a community.
994540	999540	Everyone has his own business. And besides, where is my money, you asshole?
999540	1003540	And it's just a wonderful situation. I've said that before. The film is really fantastic.
1003540	1008540	And I think such films are great. He made fun of the people who watch the film,
1008540	1013540	as it is part of marketing, i.e. with capitalist methods,
1013540	1017540	to go to the cinema and watch the film about capitalism.
1017540	1021540	Of course, everyone was pissed off afterwards. I think it's wonderful. I can really imagine
1022540	1027540	And yes, all these metaphors in the film.
1027540	1032540	Then these drug addicts at the beginning, the mafia boys with the money and so on.
1032540	1037540	And then in the end the wrong one is knocked out. And that's just great.
1037540	1042540	It's a great film. So, next film.
1042540	1047540	The next film on my list. In German it's called The Black Diamond.
1047540	1052540	I don't know, I didn't even know that it's called that.
1052540	1057540	I think I looked it up in German. It's called Uncut Gems in English.
1057540	1062540	So, unpolished diamonds, one might translate that.
1062540	1067540	The film is first of all great because it's with Adam Sandler.
1067540	1072540	And Adam Sandler, you know, that's the guy who always makes these nonsense films.
1072540	1077540	These normal mainstream comedies, nonsense films.
1077540	1082540	And in this film, which is a highly serious film, he plays a guy
1082540	1087540	in the diamond Jewish quarter, where all the other diamond Jews are sitting around
1087540	1092540	in their weird diamond boots and peeing at each other with the stones and so on.
1092540	1097540	And I think the film starts with an African from a mine knocking out a fat clunker.
1098540	1103540	That's how the film starts. So that you can briefly see the misery,
1103540	1108540	from which misery layer everything is made. And then it's just about how
1108540	1113540	Adam Sandler tries to tick this fat clunker. And the whole film turns around like this.
1113540	1118540	And Adam Sandler is just a wheel in the gear. It becomes completely clear in the film
1118540	1123540	that he is of course not a profiteur of the system. Even if he sells the stone and everything is clean.
1123540	1128540	He is a profiteur. He has an infinite amount of stress in the film. It makes him completely finished.
1128540	1133540	He also probably has debts somewhere else. And it's all semi-legal.
1133540	1138540	Then he has some mafia boys who want to finish him. And he has this diamond shop
1138540	1143540	and that's so cool. And then he somehow has a wife, then he has an affair and so on.
1143540	1148540	Then it all goes down the drain. He is always stressed. His phone is constantly ringing.
1148540	1153540	And the whole setting is so that you as a viewer are permanently really tense.
1153540	1158540	You really feel the burnout. You feel the burnout of Adam Sandler.
1158540	1162540	And Adam Sandler in the film is also shown so cool. Because he is already so old.
1162540	1166540	You can do that really well. He already looks so finished.
1166540	1171540	And then you have the camera perspectives and close-ups of the faces.
1171540	1175540	Really intense shots where people are just shown in their ugliness.
1175540	1180540	That's great. And that's what makes the film so a little bit for me.
1180540	1186540	This ruckus camera, this stress, the burnout. All that just to somehow earn money.
1186540	1191540	What the people actually do, at least he, he is also half a player.
1191540	1195540	He does sports betting and so on. He is of course completely alienated.
1195540	1201540	What he actually wants is somehow money so that he can buy something with his money.
1201540	1206540	That's actually the tenor.
1206540	1211540	The film just completely rots out. It escalates in a certain direction.
1211540	1216540	And everything is always about this stone.
1216540	1220540	I would go so far and say this is a typical, this is a real masterpiece.
1220540	1226540	It's like Killing Them Softly in my opinion. A real masterpiece in terms of a capitalism film.
1226540	1231540	It's not like The Big Short or other films like Wall Street.
1231540	1236540	Where it is clear that this is completely clear that this is about capitalism and how stupid it is now.
1236540	1241540	I think clear films like that are also great. They are just on the list here because they are part of it.
1241540	1246540	But Uncut Gems is a film that is really really premium.
1246540	1251540	And I can only recommend it to you if you don't know it.
1251540	1256540	I have the impression that such films, although they are with such fat actors, do not come into the mainstream.
1256540	1261540	Because they just treat serious topics and the audience does not want that.
1261540	1266540	Because of casualization. There are only Avengers and some strange family films.
1266540	1271540	They are in the mainstream because they create positive vibes.
1271540	1276540	And that is exactly what people need in times of crisis.
1276540	1281540	People watch so many films that they break down.
1281540	1286540	And if you don't have the mental capacity and you just look at something like that all the time, then you go crazy.
1286540	1291540	Just because you are not aware of your own empathy.
1291540	1296540	I have the feeling that there must not be a perfect political system.
1296540	1301540	Because all political currents live from friction and crumbling.
1302540	1311540	If you think with a perfect political system that it is a system where the debates do not exist.
1311540	1316540	Or where everyone is always in agreement, where there are no conflicts.
1319540	1324540	I could imagine that it is a bit like the perfect free market.
1324540	1329540	Where all information is there and all actors make perfect rational decisions.
1329540	1334540	Then there is no profit in the system anymore.
1334540	1339540	I have looked up this article from Investopedia.
1339540	1344540	The perfect free market, the perfect competition, does not generate any profit anymore.
1344540	1349540	And maybe that's what you mean, the perfect political system.
1349540	1354540	As long as it contains people, I don't think it exists.
1354540	1359540	The inherent human contradictions reflect in our society again.
1359540	1364540	On a higher level we get them all turned in again.
1364540	1369540	And be it prejudices and racism, that's enough.
1369540	1374540	But of course there are many other things that play into it.
1374540	1379540	That's why I say, because the problem is that there is no perfect political system.
1379540	1385540	The optimal solution would be the absolute crumbling of all hierarchies.
1385540	1391540	Maybe not maximum, but extremely strong decentralization.
1391540	1402540	It could be that there are groups of 50 people who can establish themselves in a kind of debate culture that can function stably.
1403540	1411540	Because even if one of them goes out with the neighbor's wife and the other husband is angry, they might not give up.
1411540	1414540	Then you can somehow solve it.
1414540	1425540	This is also observed in many Swedish films, where people realize that such problems are not so strong if there is enough mental capacity in people.
1425540	1429540	All these inter-men problems that may also shake up.
1429540	1435540	If you have hierarchies, if one is the boss of a big company and has hatred for someone,
1435540	1442540	that he tries to use his power, which he exposes only to destroy someone who has only slept with his wife,
1442540	1447540	which has nothing to do with the business or the power itself and should actually be irrelevant to the hierarchies.
1447540	1455540	But that will be done by the fact that our human flaws are transferred to it.
1455540	1457540	Such a thing would also be possible.
1457540	1462540	But such a thing is small because of decentralization, because one does not give so much power to individual people.
1462540	1464540	Then one would automatically solve it.
1468540	1471540	Yes, people are not perfect, so no systems, I would say.
1471540	1473540	Yes, that is definitely the case.
1473540	1480540	You can really compare it with stable systems.
1480540	1487540	In physics, one talks about stable systems when small deviations do not change the state of balance.
1487540	1490540	A classic example is cycling.
1490540	1494540	Cycling only works because of rotation.
1494540	1501540	Rotation creates, so to speak, the wheels turn, they have a rotation and that is a constant with respect to the fixed star.
1501540	1506540	Of course, friction takes a little bit away, but that means that when you drive and there is a small deviation,
1506540	1510540	for example, I steer a little bit like this or I wobble around a bit, then I roll and then I keep tilting back,
1510540	1515540	then I tilt back, because that is also the case with a circle, in the state of balance.
1515540	1518540	Against small deviations, it is stable.
1518540	1523540	If, of course, one of the sides gives you a drop, then you fall off the bike and then the wheel turns, of course.
1523540	1525540	But for small deviations it is good.
1525540	1531540	So, and now you have to ask yourself systematically, how do you get the small deviations?
1531540	1537540	Well, if you do not start a world war, but only once the neighbor's wife has birded, then it is a small deviation.
1537540	1539540	But that can not make a world war easier.
1539540	1543540	If you now bird the wife of Putin, then maybe.
1543540	1545540	But the problem is, only Putin is so powerful.
1545540	1552540	So if you have small decentralized organs, where, so to speak, the power cannot be organized in big hierarchies,
1552540	1556540	then you can only generate small deviations with these human errors,
1556540	1562540	which then, possibly, by the community, which then knows and acts relatively familiarly,
1562540	1568540	because everyone is connected with everyone, not so alienated and anonymous as now, for example, here,
1568540	1571540	in a big city, in a normal big city, where you do not even know your neighbors,
1571540	1573540	then something like that works.
1573540	1579540	And if you have small hierarchies, with small communities, where everything is somehow debatable,
1579540	1581540	then it is somehow more conceivable.
1581540	1585540	And then, so to speak, the question is, how do you solve this with the big problems?
1585540	1589540	Well, with real networking and transparency.
1589540	1595540	So you have to strive for a transparent global networking,
1595540	1600540	in which something similar like a democracy can be nurtured with debate culture.
1600540	1603540	But that is definitely future music.
1603540	1609540	The basic requirement would be that you have enough mature citizens.
1609540	1612540	So not like now, but really many.
1612540	1616540	Over 50% should already be people who, so to speak, come to terms with it
1616540	1620540	and at least recognize how the world works.
1629540	1632540	Social engineering.
1632540	1637540	Digitalized humanity.
1637540	1643540	The thing is, I'm doing this video series about digitalization now,
1643540	1650540	and I don't know what's next, but I'm going to make a video about blockchain at some point.
1650540	1656540	Because blockchain, so to speak, is an academic aspect,
1656540	1659540	although very academic, but a relatively positive aspect.
1659540	1664540	And I think that these things bring all these positive vibes because of what digitalization could do.
1664540	1667540	It could, for example, pick up all the monopolistic structures.
1667540	1673540	Because that is exactly what automated, decentralized trust creates, a transparent environment.
1673540	1676540	Of course, it has many disadvantages, for example, energy consumption.
1676540	1680540	But the idea is not bad at first, and you can definitely do a lot of things from it.
1680540	1684540	The thing is, I'm just drawing up a lecture on cryptography,
1684540	1690540	just because I never really managed to draw it up,
1690540	1694540	because of how it works in real life, for example with random generators.
1694540	1698540	I once had a lecture on algorithms in physics or something.
1698540	1703540	It was mainly about C-programming of such numerical problems.
1703540	1705540	But something like that was also addressed.
1705540	1708540	The thing is, when the random generator was made with us,
1708540	1710540	there are different qualities of random generators.
1710540	1712540	In essence, they all repeat themselves at some point.
1712540	1716540	That means you have to sort out the system somehow.
1716540	1720540	I missed that. I don't know, I was on vacation or something when the lecture was on.
1720540	1723540	That means, because I didn't understand it in detail,
1723540	1725540	I'm drawing up a lecture on cryptography now,
1725540	1730540	and then I want to draw up a lecture on, I don't know, higher data structures,
1730540	1733540	to really understand how that works.
1733540	1739540	Of course, I understand schematically how that works with the blockchain.
1739540	1742540	That's clear. But that's not enough for me.
1742540	1745540	I want the details so that I know what I'm talking about.
1745540	1747540	That's always the way it is.
1747540	1749540	I want to establish this habitus.
1749540	1751540	Of course, that takes time, but I have the time.
1751540	1753540	I have the privilege to draw it up.
1753540	1757540	I like to draw up 13 lectures, 90 minutes each.
1757540	1759540	Just one every day or something.
1759540	1762540	At some point I got it. At some point I understood it.
1762540	1765540	That will definitely come, but I don't know when yet.
1765540	1768540	But this digitalization series is going to be quite lengthy.
1768540	1771540	I guess 5, 6, 7, 8 videos will already be published.
1771540	1775540	But I'm also doing other things on the side, so I don't know exactly when.
1781540	1785540	Then let's look further into my list.
1786540	1789540	So, apart from Uncut Gems,
1789540	1793540	the next film I've seen is the film Good Time.
1794540	1796540	It's by the same filmmaker.
1796540	1798540	It's the film before that.
1798540	1801540	It's also pretty cool.
1801540	1806540	It has the same thing with the camera and these ugly people in the close-up.
1806540	1813540	But the story is a bit more brutal.
1814540	1822540	Uncut Gems has shown the snowball system on the level of the people we would call privileged.
1822540	1829540	People who have enough income to have a house, an affair, a sports car and so on.
1829540	1833540	And Good Time shows the difference in the USA.
1833540	1841540	People who are so poor that they don't know where to get their food next week.
1842540	1851540	The film is pretty cool because it starts with a guy in a psychological treatment.
1851540	1853540	Psychotherapy or something like that.
1853540	1855540	He's talking to someone.
1855540	1858540	He obviously has a tube test and so on.
1858540	1860540	And the guy is a bit stupid, you can already see that.
1860540	1864540	He just looks like that and gives some weird answers.
1864540	1870540	And suddenly the stupid vampire guy, Robert Pattinson, comes in.
1870540	1873540	He looks really bad in the film, that's great.
1873540	1877540	And he says, fuck off you fucking therapist, I'll take my brother with me.
1877540	1879540	I'll save him from this misery.
1879540	1880540	I'll take him with me.
1880540	1882540	And that's how the film starts.
1882540	1889540	And it turns out that Robert Pattinson, by the way, only makes cool films since he stopped this joke with the vampire.
1889540	1893540	He made a name for himself with the vampire and now he makes cool films.
1893540	1896540	And that's the best I've seen so far.
1896540	1899540	But I've seen a few others that aren't bad either.
1899540	1902540	And he's the big brother of this guy who's a bit mental.
1902540	1904540	He's a bit stupid.
1904540	1907540	And they're both poor pigs.
1907540	1909540	And what's his plan?
1909540	1914540	Well, his plan is that he'll transfer a bank with his brother and then he'll fly to Mexico.
1914540	1916540	That's the plan.
1916540	1918540	And what do they do?
1918540	1921540	They somehow have scars and they have masks.
1921540	1923540	And they dress up as black.
1923540	1929540	That's funny because it's a bit like the structural racism in the states.
1929540	1932540	Later he's in a prison cell where only black people are sitting around.
1932540	1933540	That's funny anyway.
1933540	1935540	So they transfer a bank.
1935540	1937540	Then they run away with the money.
1937540	1940540	Then everything goes wrong.
1940540	1942540	I think they lose themselves somehow.
1942540	1943540	How was that?
1943540	1948540	I think the brother, because he's a bit stupid, gets caught by the bulls.
1948540	1951540	Robert Pattinson escapes with the money.
1951540	1955540	And then, I think, he has to wash the money.
1955540	1957540	And he has a lot of problems.
1957540	1963540	The funny thing is, Robert Pattinson is the only character in the whole movie who's clever.
1963540	1964540	You notice that.
1964540	1970540	He has problems, thinks of something and finds a relatively good solution.
1970540	1975540	He has the same burnout mentality as Adam Sandler in the other movie.
1975540	1979540	Or you can compare it with Jack Bauer in 24.
1979540	1982540	24 starts, then a problem pops up.
1982540	1984540	Then three more problems pop up.
1984540	1987540	At some point he has 1,000 tabs open with 1,000 problems.
1987540	1989540	And he has to solve them all within 24 hours.
1989540	1991540	That's the way it is.
1991540	1995540	And there are unpredictable things for Robert Pattinson.
1996540	1998540	And he gets them somehow.
1998540	1999540	He tricks people.
1999540	2000540	He just talks them to death.
2000540	2002540	So he has found a method.
2002540	2003540	The people are so stupid.
2003540	2005540	He just needs to talk to them, talk to them, talk to them.
2005540	2006540	So really stupid from the side.
2006540	2009540	Until they just give up and say, yes, you're right or something.
2009540	2010540	And you notice that.
2010540	2012540	And the kind of dialogues that are introduced in the movie.
2012540	2018540	That's how I actually imagine the normal, uneducated difference in the United States.
2018540	2021540	They really only talk about such idiotic things.
2022540	2024540	By the way, Idiocacy is actually a great movie, too.
2024540	2026540	It definitely has to be included here.
2030540	2034540	And yes, that's definitely the case with the film.
2034540	2037540	You notice that right away.
2037540	2040540	And you think all the time, that can't be.
2040540	2044540	The actions sometimes seem so strange to you.
2044540	2047540	But that's just because you're completely different.
2048540	2052540	The situation is evaluated as the people who are represented there.
2052540	2055540	And to get back to the thing with the racism.
2055540	2056540	It's super funny.
2056540	2060540	They're in a amusement park in the meantime.
2060540	2062540	I think they want to somehow.
2063540	2064540	What do they actually want?
2064540	2067540	I think either they want to hide the coal or they want to get the coal.
2067540	2068540	I don't know anymore.
2068540	2070540	In any case, they break in there.
2070540	2072540	And then there are security guys.
2073540	2075540	And they have to box them over.
2075540	2076540	And he's black.
2076540	2080540	And then they steal the clothes and dress themselves as security boys.
2080540	2082540	And then the real bulls come later.
2082540	2087540	And they just clearly assume that the black one has to be the criminal.
2087540	2089540	And that's not being spoken out.
2089540	2091540	It's like killing in the soft.
2091540	2093540	It's not being spoken out.
2093540	2095540	It's just a cool situation.
2095540	2098540	And you think that's an interesting situation.
2098540	2101540	And you think that's an interesting situation.
2101540	2103540	Something like that is being watched out for.
2103540	2109540	Because of course capitalism and inequality and structural exploitation hierarchies,
2109540	2113540	such as racism or patriarchy or things like that,
2113540	2121540	they plant themselves very well in almost feudal structures
2121540	2123540	that we have in capitalism.
2123540	2128540	And that goes very well with our tradition and where the money is and the snowball system and so on.
2128540	2134540	And another cool situation is, I think in the film it was like this.
2134540	2138540	He wants to get his brother out of the hospital.
2138540	2140540	And he's being watched out for bulls.
2140540	2143540	Then he has to trick the bulls to get his brother out.
2143540	2146540	But then he finds out that he's on the wrong bed.
2146540	2152540	Because his brother was completely crushed by the blacks in the jail.
2152540	2155540	And he has a face that is completely covered with bandages.
2155540	2157540	And he doesn't know what he looks like.
2157540	2159540	And then he seems to be standing in front of the wrong bed
2159540	2161540	from another guy who was also completely crushed.
2161540	2163540	He takes him out, throws him in his car,
2163540	2165540	and then finds out that he's the wrong guy.
2165540	2166540	With him he runs around.
2166540	2168540	And the guy tells a story.
2168540	2170540	He tells a story about how it happened
2170540	2174540	that he is being watched out for bulls again and has to go to jail again and so on.
2174540	2176540	And then it's probably like this.
2176540	2179540	He came out of the jail and of course has no perspective.
2179540	2181540	Because you have to imagine, if you were in jail in the states,
2181540	2183540	then you're done for.
2183540	2188540	Then you can hardly get back into society.
2188540	2190540	First of all, you're burned.
2190540	2192540	But on the other hand, you don't have any credibility.
2192540	2194540	You don't have any credit worth.
2194540	2196540	You don't get an apartment and things like that.
2196540	2198540	Of course, you don't get a job if you don't have an apartment.
2198540	2200540	It all comes down to that.
2200540	2202540	So when you're poor, it gets more and more difficult in the USA.
2202540	2206540	Because there are very few solidarity structures at all
2207540	2209540	to catch these people.
2209540	2211540	And of course, they slip even further.
2211540	2213540	Either they become criminals again
2213540	2215540	or they rot or they are homeless
2215540	2217540	and then they become criminals again.
2217540	2219540	With little things and so on.
2219540	2221540	But that is shown in the film cool.
2221540	2224540	And the joke is, Robert Pattinson is freeing him now.
2224540	2226540	Unintentionally from the hospital.
2226540	2228540	And the guy wakes up and notices that
2228540	2230540	and says, shit, now I'm fucked.
2230540	2233540	I can't, I'm as good as in prison.
2233540	2235540	I'm out on bail.
2235540	2237540	And that you got me out of here, I can't tell anyone.
2237540	2239540	I'm fucked.
2239540	2241540	I can do whatever I want.
2241540	2243540	So that's his logical conclusion.
2243540	2245540	And that's why they go to this park.
2245540	2247540	I have a drug hiding place in the park.
2247540	2249540	With a bunch of drugs.
2249540	2251540	We can tick them, then we're rich.
2251540	2253540	And then we go to Mexico.
2253540	2255540	That was the logic.
2255540	2257540	And he helps him to find the treasure.
2257540	2259540	And that's a super funny quest.
2259540	2261540	The whole film goes like this.
2261540	2263540	And it's also from the stress level.
2263540	2265540	Just like Uncut Gems.
2265540	2267540	That you're always under stress.
2267540	2269540	And the film ends with Robert Pattinson.
2269540	2271540	How he gets arrested.
2271540	2273540	And sits in a police car.
2273540	2275540	And he looks into the camera for a minute.
2275540	2277540	And there's no music anymore.
2277540	2279540	He just looks.
2279540	2281540	And as a viewer you let everything go.
2281540	2283540	What happened in the last few minutes.
2283540	2285540	In the last hour of the film.
2285540	2287540	What he just experienced.
2287540	2289540	What he tried to solve.
2289540	2291540	What problems he solved.
2291540	2293540	And how he collapses in the end.
2293540	2295540	And how unresolvable it is for him.
2295540	2297540	It seems to him that he can't get out of this.
2297540	2299540	It's possible for him.
2299540	2301540	This perspective.
2301540	2303540	It's portrayed really well in the film.
2303540	2305540	And that's why I think it's a great film about capitalism.
2307540	2309540	Because that's how it looks.
2309540	2311540	Especially for the people who are in these situations.
2311540	2313540	Who are depicted there.
2313540	2315540	In my opinion absolutely realistic films.
2315540	2317540	Which are also portrayed so well.
2317540	2319540	In between there is also this story.
2319540	2321540	That a 15 year old is seduced.
2321540	2323540	Just to stay longer in the apartment.
2323540	2325540	There is also a lot of borderline stuff.
2325540	2327540	And it's all so dirty and dirty.
2327540	2329540	And so shit is depicted.
2329540	2331540	But just as it is.
2331540	2333540	I think that's important.
2333540	2335540	Films that just
2335540	2337540	The disgusting sides.
2337540	2339540	Of our civilization.
2339540	2341540	To the viewer in the face.
2341540	2343540	And say look at this.
2343540	2345540	Look at this shit again.
2345540	2347540	It's so similar.
2347540	2349540	I really like this film.
2349540	2351540	This french film.
2351540	2353540	Cuties.
2353540	2355540	Or so.
2355540	2357540	It's called Cuties in english.
2357540	2359540	I think it's only available in english or french.
2359540	2361540	But you could also use subtitles.
2361540	2363540	Maybe it's also available in german in the meantime.
2363540	2365540	It was a scandal film.
2365540	2367540	Because minor girls 12 or 13.
2367540	2369540	Or how old they were.
2369540	2371540	It doesn't matter.
2371540	2373540	They twerk and make music video hip-hop.
2373540	2375540	And do as if they were the biggest whores in the world.
2375540	2377540	And it's depicted in the film.
2377540	2379540	And especially the social structures are depicted.
2379540	2381540	How it is there.
2381540	2383540	When you live in a banlieue.
2383540	2385540	And how it is with this whole hip-hop culture.
2385540	2387540	Which is absolutely
2387540	2389540	Downright on this
2389540	2391540	Muslim tradition world.
2391540	2393540	From which most girls come.
2393540	2395540	And especially
2395540	2397540	This mother and so.
2397540	2399540	And these family structures, this hierarchy.
2399540	2401540	That the men can do what they want.
2401540	2403540	He gets himself a new wife.
2403540	2405540	That's all super interesting.
2405540	2407540	And the film was
2407540	2409540	That's why it was a scandal.
2409540	2411540	Because it's depicted
2411540	2413540	That the girls dance like in porn.
2413540	2415540	But first I have to say
2415540	2417540	The film is made in such a way
2417540	2419540	That it's not fetishizing.
2419540	2421540	It's not depicted as erotic.
2421540	2423540	But it's depicted
2423540	2425540	Like other little girls see it.
2425540	2427540	It's always seen
2427540	2429540	From the eyes.
2429540	2431540	From the eyes of viewers.
2431540	2433540	That are in the film.
2433540	2435540	For example little girls.
2435540	2437540	Or some erotic pedos
2437540	2439540	That sit in the audience and turn it with their smartphone.
2439540	2441540	That's
2441540	2443540	In my opinion
2443540	2445540	Not because of this taste.
2445540	2447540	But because it's a dangerous film.
2447540	2449540	Because it suggests something wrong.
2449540	2451540	I think it suggests the right thing.
2451540	2453540	And it generates this outrage.
2453540	2455540	Which had to be clear to everyone.
2455540	2457540	In my opinion for 20 years.
2457540	2459540	Since I was 14, 15.
2459540	2461540	And it will be given before.
2461540	2463540	It will be more and more because of casualization and scandalization.
2463540	2465540	The sexualization of the youth
2465540	2467540	Is a business model.
2467540	2469540	It was already there at TAF.
2469540	2471540	There was always
2471540	2473540	At least once a title to see.
2473540	2475540	Then the titles became younger and younger.
2475540	2477540	At some point they had
2477540	2479540	The final class.
2479540	2481540	Or summer girl 2010.
2481540	2483540	Or something like that.
2483540	2485540	Even before Germany's Next Topmodel.
2485540	2487540	The youngest of the youngest.
2487540	2489540	The youngest who can still be seen on TV.
2489540	2491540	Sexualized.
2491540	2493540	For the quota.
2493540	2495540	In mainstream.
2495540	2497540	And of course
2497540	2499540	It's available in small.
2499540	2501540	I saw it back then in school.
2501540	2503540	The young girls watch it.
2503540	2505540	And then they do it.
2505540	2507540	It's nothing special.
2507540	2509540	And of course they bow down to some wankers.
2509540	2511540	And force them to prostitution.
2511540	2513540	I already told you that.
2513540	2515540	Like in the other clip I made.
2515540	2517540	That's my example.
2517540	2519540	And as I said
2519540	2521540	A good time to get back to the film.
2521540	2523540	He puts it all so well.
2523540	2525540	And this stupid brother
2525540	2527540	In the end he comes back
2527540	2529540	Into this trap.
2529540	2531540	Into this therapy.
2531540	2533540	And they just sit there and
2533540	2535540	He gives himself to this system.
2535540	2537540	Because Robert Pattinson is in jail.
2537540	2539540	He doesn't come out anymore.
2539540	2541540	That's it.
2541540	2543540	And he gets there for the rest of his life
2543540	2545540	In this therapy.
2545540	2547540	And of course his brother
2547540	2549540	Had a better plan for him.
2549540	2551540	To live somewhere in freedom.
2551540	2553540	Not in this cruel capitalist life.
2553540	2555540	Where he is only gangled.
2555540	2557540	And where nothing can happen.
2557540	2559540	A wonderful film.
2559540	2561540	A 10 out of 10 for me.
2561540	2563540	I don't know if the list
2563540	2565540	That the movie gives me
2565540	2567540	Or if he sorts them
2567540	2569540	According to rating.
2569540	2571540	Or if I press F5.
2571540	2573540	But I can read what's written here.
2581540	2583540	It's all a snowball system.
2583540	2585540	Of course it's all a snowball system.
2585540	2587540	Well paid employee of Antifa GmbH.
2587540	2589540	Good evening.
2589540	2591540	Why are leftists so core disabled?
2591540	2593540	I think the USA
2593540	2595540	Will be split sooner or later.
2595540	2597540	What do you mean
2597540	2599540	With core disabled Dubai?
2599540	2601540	I have to say.
2601540	2603540	I have already noticed
2603540	2605540	That you tend to the right direction.
2605540	2607540	But to ask the question like that
2607540	2609540	Is useless.
2611540	2613540	The USA will be split sooner or later.
2613540	2615540	In my opinion the USA are already split.
2615540	2617540	For a very long time.
2617540	2619540	I wrote in the stream of Wetzelt
2619540	2621540	Trump is therefore
2621540	2623540	In my opinion not a good president
2623540	2625540	For the USA itself.
2625540	2627540	Just because he made the biggest
2627540	2629540	Hex cuts of all time.
2629540	2631540	He really has the record
2631540	2633540	For the upper 1%
2633540	2635540	To get more out and pay less taxes.
2635540	2637540	And everything else he does
2637540	2639540	Is of course only smoking.
2639540	2641540	That is not sustainable.
2641540	2643540	Because he keeps making the pyramids more pointed.
2643540	2645540	He makes sure that the redistribution
2645540	2647540	Is getting more and more intense.
2647540	2649540	And yes.
2649540	2651540	In my opinion they are already split.
2651540	2653540	That has now also been shown
2653540	2655540	In such unrest as back then
2655540	2657540	In Wetzelt Charlottesville
2657540	2659540	Where the guy just drove his car through the demo.
2659540	2661540	Or later of course
2661540	2663540	With all kinds of Black Lives Matters
2663540	2665540	Where there was an autonomous zone
2665540	2667540	Where no police could enter.
2667540	2669540	Because of course all Americans with their Gatling
2669540	2671540	Stand all over the place.
2671540	2673540	And then they made some stress.
2673540	2675540	There is already a lot going on
2675540	2677540	In this country.
2677540	2679540	I said, in my opinion
2679540	2681540	Can this only end
2681540	2683540	That the rich people
2683540	2685540	Pull back their communities
2685540	2687540	With a fortress wall around them.
2687540	2689540	And then it runs.
2697540	2699540	I smell political conditioning
2699540	2701540	Around childhood.
2701540	2703540	It definitely sits deep.
2703540	2705540	Political conditioning
2705540	2707540	I wouldn't say that.
2707540	2709540	I think
2709540	2711540	Of course it is being tried
2711540	2713540	But it doesn't sit with children.
2713540	2715540	Children are not political.
2715540	2717540	Politically
2717540	2719540	It is a kind of higher structure
2719540	2721540	Which at some point in time
2721540	2723540	Comes in as a pattern of thought.
2723540	2725540	Politics is for us
2725540	2727540	An extra pattern of thought.
2727540	2729540	You would do something politically
2729540	2731540	Which you don't do privately.
2731540	2733540	These are separated things.
2733540	2735540	Children are far too honest
2735540	2737540	And far too grounded.
2737540	2739540	They are
2739540	2741540	Very far
2741540	2743540	Elementary
2743540	2745540	What you see with children
2745540	2747540	Is that
2747540	2749540	After two years
2749540	2751540	They have a lot of
2751540	2753540	Stereotypes
2753540	2755540	In them.
2755540	2757540	The first one is man and woman.
2757540	2759540	That is very important to classification.
2759540	2761540	Their whole brain
2761540	2763540	Is designed to
2763540	2765540	In the first three or four years
2765540	2767540	To only do feature extraction and classification.
2767540	2769540	And that is where it gets clarified.
2769540	2771540	I don't know
2771540	2773540	I can at least see that
2773540	2775540	With my daughter.
2775540	2777540	But that depends on what kind of input comes in.
2777540	2779540	And you can see that
2779540	2781540	That these typical men and women
2781540	2783540	Roll.
2783540	2785540	The girls should rather
2785540	2787540	Sit in a corner and read a good book
2787540	2789540	And the boys should go out.
2789540	2791540	That is measured
2791540	2793540	At different kindergartens and schools.
2793540	2795540	That the staff likes it that way.
2795540	2797540	And that they don't want to force it.
2797540	2799540	For example the classic gender roles.
2799540	2801540	That girls are bad at math.
2801540	2803540	And boys are the genius engineers.
2803540	2805540	That is measured
2805540	2807540	In the kindergarten by themselves.
2807540	2809540	That is done subconsciously.
2809540	2811540	And of course many parents do it that way.
2811540	2813540	That is an indoctrination.
2813540	2815540	And the political
2815540	2817540	Has mostly something to do
2817540	2819540	With the social environment
2819540	2821540	Where you come from.
2821540	2823540	Of course in the long run
2823540	2825540	But especially at the beginning
2825540	2827540	Kindergarten, early childhood
2827540	2829540	That is not the case with politics.
2829540	2831540	I would agree
2831540	2833540	That later
2833540	2835540	With 14 to 18
2835540	2837540	That there is something
2837540	2839540	That goes in.
2839540	2841540	Whereby
2841540	2843540	With 14 to 18
2843540	2845540	You are mostly
2845540	2847540	If everything goes wrong
2847540	2849540	Relatively independent.
2849540	2851540	I would imagine
2851540	2853540	I thought about it myself.
2853540	2855540	I was disappointed
2855540	2857540	By the left for a long time.
2857540	2859540	And then I was out.
2859540	2861540	With 18 to 25
2861540	2863540	I was
2863540	2865540	Not interested
2865540	2867540	In politics at all.
2867540	2869540	But also
2869540	2871540	For left, right and so on.
2871540	2873540	Of course I was always a lefty.
2873540	2875540	But I felt alienated
2875540	2877540	By the left scene.
2877540	2879540	I had green dreadlocks
2879540	2881540	When I was a teenager.
2881540	2883540	I was a real disgusting punk.
2883540	2885540	But later
2885540	2887540	I politicized myself
2887540	2889540	By sitting too often in front of the computer.
2889540	2891540	That is essential.
2891540	2893540	That's how it came about.
2893540	2895540	And that's how it came about with my channel.
2895540	2897540	So
2897540	2899540	Something happens
2899540	2901540	In the sense of anyone.
2901540	2903540	And if it does not happen for profit
2903540	2905540	But for reasons
2905540	2907540	For the existence of humanity
2907540	2909540	As a pattern of thought
2909540	2911540	A pattern of thought is formed
2911540	2913540	So that the sexual intercourse decreases or so.
2913540	2915540	I would say
2915540	2917540	12 to 15-year puberty phase.
2917540	2919540	Yes, possible.
2919540	2921540	So it is definitely so
2921540	2923540	If I had to conclude from my observation
2923540	2925540	I also know
2925540	2927540	Many where I would say
2927540	2929540	Yes, that has to happen at some point
2929540	2931540	In this time
2931540	2933540	That the parents
2933540	2935540	Their ideology
2935540	2937540	The children
2937540	2939540	I would see that too.
2939540	2941540	But the most important thing
2941540	2943540	That happens much earlier.
2943540	2945540	I am convinced of that.
2945540	2947540	This thing with the ideology
2947540	2949540	You can then choose yourself at some point.
2949540	2951540	If you are 15
2951540	2953540	Then you are able to see the contradictions
2953540	2955540	Of the ideology of the parents.
2955540	2957540	That's what most people identify with puberty.
2957540	2959540	They just see the contradictions of the parents.
2959540	2961540	And they hold them in the face
2961540	2963540	And say
2963540	2965540	That's why I have always kept you.
2965540	2967540	They recognize that first
2967540	2969540	They have a mental crisis in puberty.
2969540	2971540	They realize that they have lived a lie for 10-14 years.
2971540	2973540	I thought my parents are gods.
2973540	2975540	And suddenly it doesn't work anymore.
2975540	2977540	You could also see that with puberty.
2977540	2979540	It's just a awakening.
2979540	2981540	That's where the brain
2981540	2983540	Has reached this stage of development.
2983540	2985540	To reflect on oneself
2985540	2987540	And to reflect on others
2987540	2989540	And to move into others
2989540	2991540	Where this stage is completely closed.
2991540	2993540	That's the first result.
2993540	2995540	What's going on with the world?
2995540	2997540	It's totally contradicting itself.
2997540	2999540	There are a thousand contradictions.
2999540	3001540	It's not clear at all.
3001540	3003540	That's probably called puberty.
3003540	3005540	And then it has something to do with farting and farting.
3005540	3007540	But that's another thing.
3007540	3009540	That's also coming.
3009540	3011540	I'm thinking right now
3011540	3013540	I have to pee.
3013540	3015540	I've already had too much beer before.
3015540	3017540	Before we continue with the next film
3017540	3019540	I'll turn on the music first.
3019540	3021540	I'm thinking about what to do.
3021540	3023540	Write in the chat
3023540	3025540	If you want something hard
3025540	3027540	Or if you want something relaxed.
3027540	3029540	And I'll think about it.
3049540	3051540	What's hard?
3051540	3053540	Yes, that you say that.
3053540	3055540	Death row.
3055540	3057540	I could have thought of that.
3057540	3059540	Okay, but because you want death row
3059540	3061540	You definitely want some black metal.
3061540	3063540	And I don't like that.
3063540	3065540	Hard, relaxed.
3065540	3067540	Difficult.
3067540	3069540	It works, of course.
3069540	3071540	But I'll do it first.
3071540	3073540	A little bit of death metal.
3073540	3075540	And then I'm going to pee
3075540	3077540	And then I'll be right there.
3077540	3079540	And then I'm going to pee and then I'll be right there.
3079540	3081540	We'll do it here.
3083540	3085540	There, that's good.
3107540	3109540	That's good.
3137540	3139540	That's good.
3167540	3169540	That's good.
3197540	3199540	That's good.
3227540	3229540	That's good.
3257540	3259540	That's good.
3287540	3291540	Are you ready?
3317540	3319540	That's good.
3347540	3349540	That's good.
3349540	3351540	That's good.
3351540	3353540	That's good.
3369540	3373540	Does he think that the coal soup was bad?
3373540	3375540	While he spits them out?
3375540	3377540	or does it only look like a bandwagon?
3377540	3385540	Well, that's a stylistic tool that doesn't appeal to the common listener at all.
3385540	3387540	That's anti-casualization.
3387540	3397540	And when I was young, I listened to Korn and Rammstein.
3397540	3400540	The first Korn album and the first Rammstein album.
3400540	3403540	I listened to them in the first and second grade.
3403540	3406540	That was the shit back then. I thought that was crazy.
3406540	3411540	And then I was in a fan camp.
3411540	3415540	Maybe I've already told you the story.
3415540	3418540	In a fan camp there was a buddy of a teacher.
3418540	3421540	An awful metalhead. It's clear to me now that he was a metalhead.
3421540	3424540	He said, here boy, you can already hear the crazy music.
3424540	3427540	Come to my car. I have a great facility in the car.
3427540	3429540	No homo, no pedo.
3429540	3434540	And then he played me Morbid Angel or Cannibal Corpse or something like that.
3434540	3436540	And it was just exactly that.
3436540	3440540	What is the man doing there? Why does it sound so stupid? What is that? What is he supposed to do?
3440540	3444540	And then he said, if you listen to something like that now, you'll hear something like that later.
3444540	3447540	And I said, no, that doesn't make any sense at all. It's shit.
3447540	3450540	And it's actually like that. You have to develop a ear for it.
3450540	3454540	It's like for a good wine or for a whiskey or something.
3454540	3456540	You have to develop a taste for it.
3456540	3459540	You have to have a sense of sensibility.
3459540	3463540	And with that kind of music, I've had the craziest thing with black metal.
3463540	3468540	For ten years, after I've already heard super extreme music,
3468540	3471540	I've still dedicated myself to black metal for its rudeness.
3471540	3474540	And it's only been a few years since I've been able to hear black metal.
3474540	3478540	And yes, that's how it is for the...
3478540	3481540	So if you've never heard that before, then it's not for you.
3481540	3482540	You're thinking, what's the point of that?
3482540	3485540	First of all, it sounds super stupid. You're thinking, what kind of stupid thing is that?
3485540	3487540	But that's always the case with art.
3487540	3489540	And the most obviously stupid thing is, of course, hip-hop.
3489540	3493540	And that attracts everyone, of course, because it's very easy to understand.
3493540	3496540	That's full, no casualization.
3496540	3499540	Because that's all about how you become a pimp.
3499540	3504540	And the boys think that with 12, 13, 14, 15, of course, that's great.
3504540	3506540	Anyway, another topic.
3506540	3510540	So, hard, relaxed comes next.
3510540	3512540	And then comes relaxed electromove.
3512540	3514540	That's all I have.
3516540	3518540	Ah.
3518540	3520540	A Mindener?
3520540	3522540	No, he didn't come from Minden.
3522540	3524540	He came here directly from my city.
3524540	3526540	I sometimes see him on the Christmas market.
3526540	3528540	And I tell him that he shaped me.
3528540	3530540	As a little child.
3530540	3533540	Of course, he can't remember it, but I can't remember him.
3533540	3535540	I always tell him that.
3535540	3537540	Yes, of course.
3537540	3539540	So, let's move on to the list.
3539540	3541540	Let's move on to the list.
3541540	3543540	So, the next thing on my list is the film.
3543540	3545540	Which is also completely unknown.
3545540	3547540	Black 47.
3547540	3549540	I don't even know what it's called.
3549540	3551540	No, it's also called Black 47 in German.
3551540	3554540	And the film takes place in Ireland.
3554540	3559540	At the time when the British Empire was still big at the start.
3559540	3565540	And since then, the Iranians have had the worst hatred of Great Britain.
3565540	3567540	Because they were the colonial powers.
3567540	3569540	They were occupiers.
3569540	3571540	They just went through imperialism.
3571540	3573540	With the Iranians.
3573540	3576540	With the Gaelic people, who just wanted to wander around.
3576540	3578540	And the film begins.
3578540	3580540	There comes a soldier from the war again.
3580540	3582540	Who swore for the British.
3582540	3586540	He is a traitor for the Iranians.
3586540	3590540	And he just wants to go home to his family.
3590540	3592540	And he arrives and sees that the house is destroyed.
3592540	3594540	The family is no longer really there.
3594540	3598540	And he is then first of all taken into this paper logic.
3598540	3600540	Who are you? Why don't you have ID papers?
3600540	3602540	And so on and so forth.
3602540	3604540	Then he smashes them all away.
3604540	3606540	And so it really rots out.
3606540	3610540	And the scene that made capitalism critical for me.
3610540	3612540	Is the situation.
3612540	3616540	That there are the remains of his family.
3616540	3618540	I believe his sister.
3618540	3620540	His little sister has a child.
3620540	3622540	She lives with her husband.
3622540	3624540	In an abandoned house.
3624540	3626540	In the middle of nowhere.
3626540	3628540	In the middle of Pampa there is nothing.
3628540	3630540	Except such a tram and a stone house.
3630540	3632540	With a straw roof around it.
3632540	3634540	And it's cold as hell. It's winter.
3634540	3636540	The people die out there just because it's so cold.
3636540	3638540	His old original house.
3638540	3640540	So where she comes from, it's bombed away.
3640540	3642540	There is nothing left.
3642540	3644540	And they live in this house where nothing is.
3644540	3646540	Where nobody bothers.
3646540	3648540	And suddenly the British militia arrives.
3648540	3650540	And ensures justice and order.
3650540	3654540	Because they don't even own this property.
3654540	3656540	They don't own this property at all.
3656540	3658540	It's written on a piece of paper.
3658540	3660540	That it belongs to someone else.
3660540	3662540	And nobody bothers.
3662540	3664540	But they just bother.
3664540	3666540	Because they are the colonial power.
3666540	3668540	And they want to suppress them.
3668540	3670540	And with that the film starts.
3670540	3672540	That's the 14th or 15th minute.
3672540	3674540	Or maybe half an hour.
3674540	3676540	There is this scene.
3676540	3678540	And it's so absurd.
3678540	3680540	Because it shows exactly how it is with the property.
3680540	3682540	It's cold as hell.
3682540	3684540	And they get shot.
3684540	3686540	That means they die.
3686540	3688540	Because it's minus 10 degrees.
3688540	3690540	The man thinks it's shit.
3690540	3692540	And he gets shot by the soldiers.
3692540	3694540	Who only do their duty.
3694540	3696540	And in the film it's shown very well.
3696540	3698540	If you talk to some of the irons.
3698540	3700540	At best old irons.
3700540	3702540	They have the story in their pockets.
3702540	3704540	How it is with the British.
3704540	3706540	With the great power of Great Britain.
3706540	3708540	Why they are so powerful.
3708540	3710540	Why they are so powerful.
3710540	3712540	Why they are so powerful.
3712540	3714540	And how they have
3714540	3716540	in the smallest
3716540	3718540	already
3718540	3720540	built out their power structures.
3720540	3722540	And just suppressed people.
3722540	3724540	Just for fun.
3724540	3726540	The film is a bit dystopian.
3726540	3728540	The film seems to me
3728540	3730540	so dark and so disgusting.
3730540	3732540	And everything is hopeless.
3732540	3734540	And so really disgusting.
3734540	3736540	It reminds me of The Road.
3736540	3738540	Just because of the climate.
3738540	3740540	Because it's so shit and so dystopian.
3740540	3742540	It's just really shit.
3742540	3744540	And that's why
3744540	3746540	the film plays in the past.
3746540	3748540	But he sees
3748540	3750540	in front of my inner eye
3750540	3752540	he felt
3752540	3754540	as if it was a representation
3754540	3756540	for a future version.
3756540	3758540	As if it was a dystopian film.
3758540	3760540	As if we could go back
3760540	3762540	in such a situation.
3762540	3764540	That's how the film affects me.
3764540	3766540	I can't really describe it.
3766540	3768540	Because nobody would think
3768540	3770540	that this is a capitalism film.
3770540	3772540	But somehow for me
3772540	3774540	it's probably because of my selection bias.
3774540	3776540	Because I make so many
3776540	3778540	YouTube videos.
3778540	3780540	And I have this English channel
3780540	3782540	one year longer than the German one.
3782540	3784540	I'm more active with the Snow Wall system.
3784540	3786540	With all these ideas.
3786540	3788540	To criticize that.
3788540	3790540	I think that's the reason.
3790540	3792540	It's always like that.
3792540	3794540	When you have tunnel vision
3794540	3796540	you only have the nail
3796540	3798540	and the hammer.
3798540	3800540	That's about it.
3800540	3802540	The next film is The Big Short.
3802540	3804540	I don't need to talk about it.
3804540	3806540	It's clear.
3806540	3808540	The best part of the film is Brad Pitt.
3808540	3810540	Like with Killings and Softly.
3810540	3812540	He's a really cool guy.
3812540	3814540	But I don't need to talk about it.
3814540	3816540	The film is well known.
3816540	3818540	It's 2008, financial crisis,
3818540	3820540	perfectly explained.
3820540	3822540	In a really cool movie.
3822540	3824540	All around.
3824540	3826540	Hollywood.
3826540	3828540	Nice people are shown.
3828540	3830540	They tell you something.
3830540	3832540	The film tells
3832540	3834540	a nice story.
3834540	3836540	Around this whole situation.
3836540	3838540	And how criminal
3838540	3840540	the banks and the rating agencies are.
3840540	3842540	How criminal they are.
3842540	3844540	That's shown really well.
3844540	3846540	And of course it's fantastic.
3846540	3848540	Every single aspect,
3848540	3850540	every level of the Snow Wall system
3850540	3852540	is shown.
3860540	3862540	I just missed the context.
3862540	3864540	You're the one with the hot air balloon, right?
3874540	3876540	I don't get it.
3880540	3882540	Kvairz wrote a Minden-Thunder.
3882540	3884540	I thought he meant someone from Minden.
3886540	3888540	Then Felix Fuchs-Hase
3888540	3890540	felt like he was talking.
3890540	3892540	Because he's from Minden.
3892540	3894540	Now Kvairz says at least.
3896540	3898540	And then he says something about the hot air balloon.
3898540	3900540	That's too hard for me.
3900540	3902540	In Hip-Hop
3902540	3904540	there are underground styles.
3904540	3906540	Psycho-Core for example.
3906540	3908540	Where you think WTF.
3908540	3910540	The majority is categorization
3910540	3912540	up to 10. But another topic.
3912540	3914540	Sure, in Hip-Hop
3914540	3916540	actually
3916540	3918540	I never really thought about it.
3918540	3920540	But I always had the feeling that
3920540	3922540	Hip-Hop is about class struggle.
3922540	3924540	About how you can
3924540	3926540	as a little man
3926540	3928540	fight your life in the worst way
3928540	3930540	in the USA, where there is no solidarity.
3932540	3934540	And if you grow up in a block
3934540	3936540	somewhere in a new settlement
3936540	3938540	in the East it's nothing different.
3938540	3940540	You can do Hip-Hop about it.
3940540	3942540	Because the stories of the streets
3942540	3944540	happen there. The whole country.
3944540	3946540	You see it.
3946540	3948540	And you have something to tell.
3948540	3950540	And that's being transported in Hip-Hop.
3950540	3952540	It's being transported very well.
3952540	3954540	Because you don't need musical skills for it.
3954540	3956540	To make a beat is trivial.
3956540	3958540	Or you always find someone who can do it.
3958540	3960540	And the rest is alienation.
3960540	3962540	Then you can rap about it.
3962540	3964540	Of course you don't need the skills.
3964540	3966540	It's all art.
3966540	3968540	Because you have to do it with the rhyme.
3968540	3970540	And really cool boys can do it live.
3970540	3972540	You give them a theme about what they should rap about
3972540	3974540	and then they do it.
3974540	3976540	That's a lot of art. I don't want to deny that.
3976540	3978540	But mainstream rap is of course ridiculous.
3978540	3980540	In Germany it's even more ridiculous.
3980540	3982540	Because everything that happens in Germany
3982540	3984540	in mainstream is really the funniest.
3984540	3986540	It's always copied from the USA.
3986540	3988540	They just copy the trends from there.
3988540	3990540	And then they make it worse.
3990540	3992540	You see that everywhere.
3992540	3994540	With Joko and Klaas.
3994540	3996540	With the men's world.
3996540	3998540	It's just a copy of Me Too.
3998540	4000540	Things like that.
4000540	4002540	Even that. It's super ridiculous.
4002540	4004540	And you see it even crazier with the German influencers.
4004540	4006540	They just copy content directly.
4006540	4008540	And the one who puts it on the top
4008540	4010540	is of course Mani Boy.
4010540	4012540	Mani Boy is just a funny guy.
4012540	4014540	With all his nonsense.
4014540	4016540	100% is basically every video
4016540	4018540	of any other American influencer
4018540	4020540	who makes Hip-Hop.
4020540	4022540	100%. Just copied.
4022540	4024540	It's just funny.
4036540	4038540	What's the next movie?
4038540	4040540	The next movie.
4040540	4042540	The big crash margin call.
4042540	4044540	It's at least as awesome
4044540	4046540	as The Big Short.
4046540	4048540	But it's a bit more unknown.
4048540	4050540	First with Kevin Spacey.
4050540	4052540	It's great.
4052540	4054540	But mostly
4054540	4056540	from a different perspective.
4058540	4060540	The movie is also about
4060540	4062540	the 2008 financial crisis.
4064540	4066540	But from the perspective
4066540	4068540	of The Big Short
4068540	4070540	the decision-making levels
4070540	4072540	the banks, the politics
4072540	4074540	the rating agencies
4074540	4076540	the big companies
4076540	4078540	From this perspective
4078540	4080540	The Big Short is not represented.
4080540	4082540	It's a middle class.
4082540	4084540	With the big crash
4084540	4086540	at margin call
4086540	4088540	it's about the top level
4088540	4090540	of some kind of
4090540	4092540	I assume
4092540	4094540	some financial advisory company
4094540	4096540	or something like that.
4096540	4098540	Could be another
4098540	4100540	snowball system. Doesn't matter.
4102540	4104540	It's so awesome.
4104540	4106540	It's just like
4106540	4108540	a piece of paper.
4108540	4110540	The audience doesn't know
4110540	4112540	what's on the paper.
4112540	4114540	They panic.
4114540	4116540	They want to know what's on the paper.
4116540	4118540	But the audience doesn't know
4118540	4120540	what's on the paper.
4120540	4122540	The paper goes all the way
4122540	4124540	up in the snowball system.
4124540	4126540	At some point Kevin Spacey comes
4126540	4128540	by. Kevin Spacey is
4128540	4130540	one of the last
4130540	4132540	in this pyramid.
4132540	4134540	And that's super awesome.
4134540	4136540	Because on the paper
4136540	4138540	our system collabs.
4138540	4140540	Our mathematical models
4140540	4142540	have results.
4142540	4144540	And everyone sees the crash
4144540	4146540	and has to limit the damage.
4146540	4148540	And in the movie
4148540	4150540	it's shown pretty well.
4150540	4152540	The smallest wankers
4152540	4154540	die from their job.
4154540	4156540	They tank the damage.
4156540	4158540	In the end.
4158540	4160540	People like Kevin Spacey
4160540	4162540	The absolute
4162540	4164540	king is a famous actor.
4164540	4166540	I can't remember his name.
4166540	4168540	He plays a great role.
4168540	4170540	Because he's the absolute
4170540	4172540	top mafia mob.
4172540	4174540	Everyone has respect for him.
4174540	4176540	And the best scene
4176540	4178540	in the movie
4178540	4180540	is where
4180540	4182540	a small
4182540	4184540	middleman
4184540	4186540	explains how the business works.
4186540	4188540	That's so awesome.
4188540	4190540	I laughed my ass off.
4190540	4192540	I was so happy.
4192540	4194540	That was super serious.
4194540	4196540	In the cabrio he explains how the business works.
4196540	4198540	And in the end
4198540	4200540	the little wanker went to the toilet
4200540	4202540	and puked.
4202540	4204540	And that sucked.
4204540	4206540	Just because he explained
4206540	4208540	how messy capitalism really is.
4208540	4210540	And that he lived a lie when he
4210540	4212540	made the propaganda fairy
4212540	4214540	to be successful
4214540	4216540	and to be a great businessman.
4216540	4218540	That's super shown in the movie.
4218540	4220540	A great movie.
4220540	4222540	And much less known than The Big Short.
4222540	4224540	But totally wrong.
4224540	4226540	He has to be known.
4226540	4228540	Everyone should know him in the movie.
4230540	4232540	He's like The Big Short.
4232540	4234540	He tells about capitalism.
4234540	4236540	He talks about it.
4236540	4238540	You don't have to talk in metaphors.
4238540	4240540	It's not a hidden story
4240540	4242540	like in Good Time or Killing Them Softly
4242540	4244540	where you have to think about it.
4244540	4246540	It hits you right in the face.
4246540	4248540	How it is with the alienation.
4248540	4250540	And with the Wall Street.
4250540	4252540	That's super.
4252540	4254540	That's a really awesome movie.
4254540	4256540	And he has so many details.
4256540	4258540	So many details.
4258540	4260540	Like I said, it starts with the note.
4260540	4262540	And then all these dialogues.
4262540	4264540	And Kevin Spacey is also
4264540	4266540	and that's always the nice thing.
4266540	4268540	You want to think that they are all winners of the system.
4268540	4270540	But you can see very clearly that they are not.
4270540	4272540	They all have a terrible life.
4272540	4274540	Kevin Spacey is the main character.
4274540	4276540	And he is also
4276540	4278540	depicted a little bit
4278540	4280540	of his private life.
4280540	4282540	How toxic it all is.
4282540	4284540	He's separated from his wife.
4284540	4286540	The only flaw I have
4286540	4288540	with The Big Crash is that
4288540	4290540	the smart-spirited geek-nerd-2-type
4290540	4292540	is an engineer.
4292540	4294540	It's always depicted
4294540	4296540	as if the engineers
4296540	4298540	are the cool guys with the math
4298540	4300540	and the crazy knowledge.
4300540	4302540	But in reality it's more
4302540	4304540	IT-ers,
4304540	4306540	mathematicians or physicists
4306540	4308540	who do this shit.
4308540	4310540	Because they are the ones with the math skills.
4310540	4312540	You have to imagine that in a pyramid.
4312540	4314540	You have math, that's the shit.
4314540	4316540	That's the real shit.
4316540	4318540	But it's often too abstract.
4318540	4320540	Only if you're up for it before, you go after the math
4320540	4322540	in something else.
4322540	4324540	Otherwise people just stay there in the math
4324540	4326540	and prove that some 74-dimensional rings
4326540	4328540	create some crazy algebras
4328540	4330540	and structures
4330540	4332540	and that's why they form a group.
4332540	4334540	That's what they do.
4334540	4336540	But there are two kinds of math.
4336540	4338540	One is computer science,
4338540	4340540	so IT.
4340540	4342540	It's basically applied math.
4342540	4344540	Theoretical Informatics 1 and 2
4344540	4346540	are only about
4346540	4348540	formal
4348540	4350540	proofability and decision-making
4350540	4352540	and things like that.
4352540	4354540	And in the end Goedel's Inconvenience.
4354540	4356540	And the other thing is physics.
4356540	4358540	That's the description of what we see out here
4358540	4360540	with the language of mathematics.
4360540	4362540	Those are the two adults.
4362540	4364540	And everything below that,
4364540	4366540	biology,
4366540	4368540	geology,
4368540	4370540	economics,
4370540	4372540	I don't even want to start with that.
4372540	4374540	It doesn't count at all.
4374540	4376540	That's a bastard.
4376540	4378540	The priest once
4378540	4380540	accidentally
4380540	4382540	fucked a boy's ass, but a girl's
4382540	4384540	and she got pregnant.
4384540	4386540	That's the motto.
4386540	4388540	And other than that
4388540	4390540	chemistry, engineering,
4390540	4392540	engineers,
4392540	4394540	those are craftsmen,
4394540	4396540	those are people with a screwdriver in their hands.
4396540	4398540	The real nerds
4398540	4400540	are math, physics
4400540	4402540	and computer science.
4402540	4404540	But computer science is difficult
4404540	4406540	because you have a lot of computer scientists
4406540	4408540	who do something far from mathematics.
4408540	4410540	In the end they only become web designers
4410540	4412540	or admins in some
4412540	4414540	different structures and so on.
4414540	4416540	But real computer science,
4416540	4418540	the really crazy shit,
4418540	4420540	that's super sexy.
4420540	4422540	And I would go a little bit in that direction
4422540	4424540	with cryptography, for example.
4424540	4426540	That's what I'm working on right now.
4426540	4428540	But also a lot of other things.
4428540	4430540	Decisiveness problems, NP,
4430540	4432540	completeness, stuff like that,
4432540	4434540	Turing machine, everything that has to do with it.
4434540	4436540	That's mathematics.
4436540	4438540	That's completely clear.
4438540	4440540	That's just a concrete application
4440540	4442540	of the language.
4442540	4444540	Because predictability is
4444540	4446540	a question of mathematics.
4446540	4448540	But it is occupied by computer science
4448540	4450540	and there are
4450540	4452540	extra lectures about it and so on.
4452540	4454540	But in my opinion it all comes together.
4454540	4456540	If you are a real physicist,
4456540	4458540	you also include IT and math.
4458540	4460540	If you are a real mathematician, you also include math and computer science.
4460540	4462540	If you are a real mathematician, you also include math.
4462540	4464540	Physics mostly not because
4464540	4466540	it is an application
4466540	4468540	that most IT people are not interested in.
4468540	4470540	They want to understand how a quantum computer works.
4470540	4472540	But that's a different story.
4474540	4476540	I'm a little disappointed
4476540	4478540	because of the engineer.
4478540	4480540	But otherwise the movie is great.
4480540	4482540	Except for the engineer, the movie is absolutely great.
4482540	4484540	Where am I?
4484540	4486540	I'll read a little more.
4490540	4492540	Yes, enough awesome hip-hop.
4492540	4494540	Honestly, I've already heard
4494540	4496540	from Alligator that it should be nice.
4496540	4498540	I can't say anything about the others.
4498540	4500540	Yandilay, Semidilux, Dendemann.
4500540	4502540	It all sounds like nonsense to me.
4502540	4504540	Who do I like the most?
4504540	4506540	The one over there.
4506540	4508540	The one hanging on the wall over there.
4508540	4510540	Captain Peng.
4510540	4512540	He is great.
4512540	4514540	Captain Peng, can you
4514540	4516540	take a look at it?
4516540	4518540	There are a few things on YouTube.
4518540	4520540	Super awesome, of course very poetic.
4520540	4522540	Deep-seated philosophical texts.
4522540	4524540	Super packed.
4524540	4526540	Super packed, I think it's great.
4526540	4528540	I'm a fan, I've seen it live.
4528540	4530540	Captain Peng and the tetake from Delphi.
4530540	4532540	The woman was already pregnant.
4532540	4534540	We pulled ourselves in, that was great.
4534540	4536540	I like him for example.
4536540	4538540	I'm also really into Romano.
4538540	4540540	Just because of the middleman.
4540540	4542540	Because the guy represents this ambivalence.
4542540	4544540	He has so much because
4544540	4546540	he grew up in the 90s.
4546540	4548540	He ate it all up.
4548540	4550540	You can tell by the way he talks
4550540	4552540	that he has all these cultural influences.
4552540	4554540	And that's great.
4554540	4556540	I drove to Osnabrück
4556540	4558540	and saw him live and showed him
4558540	4560540	my metal cut and we did a high five.
4560540	4562540	That was great. I like him.
4562540	4564540	He's just nice.
4564540	4566540	And he does funny stuff.
4566540	4568540	He also does capitalism criticism.
4568540	4570540	If he wants to.
4570540	4572540	I'm sure there's good hip-hop.
4572540	4574540	Especially because
4574540	4576540	it's a grassroots thing.
4576540	4578540	From the streets.
4578540	4580540	With attitudes.
4580540	4582540	It's the struggle.
4582540	4584540	Against the hierarchy and the shit.
4584540	4586540	Against our expansion system.
4586540	4588540	You have to say how shitty it is.
4588540	4590540	I just remembered another movie.
4590540	4592540	I have to play it before I continue.
4592540	4594540	Or I'll forget it.
4594540	4596540	It's called
4596540	4598540	The one with Jennifer Lopez.
4600540	4602540	Don't be surprised.
4602540	4604540	It's great.
4604540	4606540	It's called Hustlers.
4606540	4608540	Hustlers.
4608540	4610540	I'll talk about it later.
4610540	4612540	Then we'll have it.
4612540	4614540	It's a great movie.
4614540	4616540	Hustlers.
4616540	4618540	Where do I have it?
4618540	4620540	Imagine.
4620540	4622540	Jennifer Lopez
4622540	4624540	is a stripper
4624540	4626540	in the USA.
4628540	4630540	She has to get around
4630540	4632540	and she has a kid.
4632540	4634540	She has to pay the rent.
4634540	4636540	Like all Americans.
4636540	4638540	It's always the complete alienation.
4638540	4640540	They only do the job because of the money.
4642540	4644540	She finds out
4644540	4646540	that you can get bigger money
4646540	4648540	when you do private parties
4648540	4650540	with the fat punks.
4650540	4652540	You only need
4652540	4654540	a few girls.
4654540	4656540	She knows enough girls
4656540	4658540	that you can get around.
4658540	4660540	The great thing is
4660540	4662540	we do private parties
4662540	4664540	with their wives.
4664540	4666540	They don't like their wives.
4666540	4668540	They are managers.
4668540	4670540	They all have a wife.
4670540	4672540	So they do this.
4672540	4674540	They do a party with their wives.
4674540	4676540	They give them drugs.
4676540	4678540	They steal their credit cards
4678540	4680540	and take the money.
4680540	4682540	They pull the money
4682540	4684540	out of the hierarchy
4684540	4686540	like Robin Hood.
4686540	4688540	That's the business model.
4688540	4690540	It works well.
4690540	4692540	In the movie
4692540	4694540	you can see certain aspects
4694540	4696540	of how it works.
4696540	4698540	With the strip-shops
4698540	4700540	and the logic of use.
4700540	4702540	If you are too bad
4702540	4704540	you have to piss yourself off.
4704540	4706540	You have to do casualization
4706540	4708540	and marketing.
4708540	4710540	It looks great.
4710540	4712540	Not with academic words.
4712540	4714540	Not like in a lecture.
4714540	4716540	Just like it looks
4716540	4718540	on the street.
4718540	4720540	That's awesome.
4720540	4722540	It's not academic.
4722540	4724540	It's easy for everyone
4724540	4726540	why the problems
4726540	4728540	are for this person
4728540	4730540	and why they act like that.
4730540	4732540	That's great.
4732540	4734540	Jennifer Lopez
4734540	4736540	does a great business out of it.
4736540	4738540	She modifies it
4738540	4740540	and expands it.
4740540	4742540	She gets more girls
4742540	4744540	who can take more orders.
4744540	4746540	Who expand more
4746540	4748540	and maybe to other cities.
4748540	4750540	That's great.
4750540	4752540	I haven't seen the movie
4752540	4754540	for a long time.
4754540	4756540	It's not that long
4756540	4758540	but I don't know how it ends.
4758540	4760540	The movie was
4760540	4762540	a great criticism of capitalism.
4762540	4764540	It's a perfect movie
4764540	4766540	because it shows
4766540	4768540	a certain aspect
4768540	4770540	of capitalism
4770540	4772540	that you can't kill.
4772540	4774540	It's about
4774540	4776540	the business aspects
4776540	4778540	of capitalism.
4778540	4780540	Jennifer Lopez has to calculate
4780540	4782540	and clear her business.
4782540	4784540	She has to stay clean
4784540	4786540	and have a clear mind.
4786540	4788540	I've seen
4788540	4790540	another movie
4790540	4792540	where a woman
4792540	4794540	is hosting
4794540	4796540	poker tournaments.
4796540	4798540	She's crazy.
4798540	4800540	What was the name of the movie?
4800540	4802540	If my wife
4802540	4804540	would watch it,
4804540	4806540	she would have
4806540	4808540	drunk too much alcohol
4808540	4810540	after the barbecue.
4810540	4812540	I think she's drunk already.
4812540	4814540	If she would watch it,
4814540	4816540	she would know the movie.
4816540	4818540	It's a movie
4818540	4820540	where a woman
4820540	4822540	is hosting
4822540	4824540	poker tournaments.
4824540	4826540	This nerd
4826540	4828540	also participates.
4828540	4830540	Who participates?
4830540	4832540	Kevin Costner.
4832540	4834540	I just need to go through
4834540	4836540	the movie list with Kevin Costner.
4836540	4838540	Kevin Costner.
4838540	4840540	I click on it.
4842540	4844540	Filmography.
4844540	4846540	Then I scroll down.
4846540	4848540	This has to happen.
4848540	4850540	The movie is called Molly's Game.
4850540	4852540	Great.
4852540	4854540	Molly's Game.
4854540	4856540	Not bad.
4858540	4860540	I'll put it in the list.
4860540	4862540	Great movie about capitalism.
4864540	4866540	It's like this.
4868540	4870540	Kevin Costner
4870540	4872540	has, I think,
4872540	4874540	three children.
4874540	4876540	And Kevin Costner is a great guy.
4876540	4878540	The woman is still awake.
4878540	4880540	I already took over the job.
4880540	4882540	I found out the movie.
4882540	4884540	But it's funny.
4884540	4886540	You can talk to the boys
4886540	4888540	if you write funny things.
4888540	4890540	He has three children.
4890540	4892540	They are all elite children.
4892540	4894540	He promotes and demands
4894540	4896540	endlessly.
4896540	4898540	He makes real professionals out of him.
4898540	4900540	Everything they do is to the max.
4900540	4902540	Only pro-gamer-wise.
4902540	4904540	High level, upper point, one percent.
4904540	4906540	If you bring performance,
4906540	4908540	you have to get the gold medal in the Olympics.
4908540	4910540	For example, at the ski jump.
4910540	4912540	Molly,
4912540	4914540	the main character,
4914540	4916540	she does ski jumping.
4916540	4918540	She pulls something in here
4918540	4920540	and gets something crazy everywhere.
4920540	4922540	A finish here and there.
4922540	4924540	Super cool.
4924540	4926540	The movie is so funny
4926540	4928540	because it shows
4928540	4930540	exactly this scaling
4930540	4932540	and the business model.
4932540	4934540	It's off-secret
4934540	4936540	because
4936540	4938540	luck in this scale
4938540	4940540	is forbidden in the USA
4940540	4942540	as soon as you take something from the pot.
4942540	4944540	As soon as you take a profit.
4944540	4946540	It's well represented.
4946540	4948540	She has a lawyer
4948540	4950540	and then there's a trial.
4950540	4952540	It's about honor
4952540	4954540	and now
4954540	4956540	it's about
4958540	4960540	it's about
4960540	4962540	patriarchy
4962540	4964540	and how women
4964540	4966540	in this world
4966540	4968540	can achieve more
4968540	4970540	if they want to.
4970540	4972540	They have to push through.
4972540	4974540	The fight, the struggle,
4974540	4976540	it's so well represented.
4976540	4978540	And she's a crazy troll.
4978540	4980540	She can do everything.
4980540	4982540	She's very intellectual
4982540	4984540	and she looks good
4984540	4986540	and she could achieve everything.
4986540	4988540	But she wants to do
4988540	4990540	these half-illegal business.
4990540	4992540	That's her thing.
4992540	4994540	She just wanted to get her daddy
4994540	4996540	out of it.
4996540	4998540	But the movie is great
4998540	5000540	and it's about capitalism.
5000540	5002540	Mully's Game
5002540	5004540	I can only recommend it.
5004540	5006540	It's not direct.
5006540	5008540	It's not like Margin Call
5008540	5010540	or The Big Shot where you say
5010540	5012540	capitalism is going to blow your face.
5012540	5014540	You look at it from the perspective
5014540	5016540	with the glasses
5016540	5018540	that I want to show you.
5018540	5020540	It's all a snowball system.
5020540	5022540	Look where the snowball system is.
5022540	5024540	Then you see the snowball systems everywhere.
5024540	5026540	It's no wonder.
5030540	5032540	The next movie
5032540	5034540	that I want to talk about
5034540	5036540	is the first movie
5036540	5038540	with Robert Pattinson
5038540	5040540	that I saw
5040540	5042540	where I thought,
5042540	5044540	maybe this guy has potential.
5044540	5046540	Cosmopolis
5046540	5048540	The movie itself is not great.
5048540	5050540	It's almost an art movie.
5050540	5052540	I don't want to say David Lynch
5052540	5054540	but it seems
5054540	5056540	like an art movie
5056540	5058540	because it has
5058540	5060540	absurd actions.
5060540	5062540	Robert Pattinson seems
5062540	5064540	to be an extremely rich guy
5064540	5066540	who drives around in a limousine.
5066540	5068540	And outside the limousine
5068540	5070540	the whole world collapses.
5070540	5072540	Probably after 2008
5072540	5074540	in a financial crash.
5074540	5076540	That's the setting.
5076540	5078540	That's what I think.
5078540	5080540	It's not really named.
5080540	5082540	He does his rounds
5082540	5084540	with his limousine,
5084540	5086540	goes to stores, has quests.
5086540	5088540	And in the end
5088540	5090540	it culminates
5090540	5092540	because he's hanging around
5092540	5094540	in a limousine.
5094540	5096540	I don't know if the woman will listen.
5096540	5098540	There's a guy
5098540	5100540	who was once released
5100540	5102540	by his father
5102540	5104540	and since then
5104540	5106540	his existence sucks
5106540	5108540	and he feels really bad.
5108540	5110540	And the whole movie
5110540	5112540	has this obvious touch.
5112540	5114540	Take a look at the elite
5114540	5116540	how disgusting they are on the road.
5116540	5118540	That's shown really well.
5118540	5120540	And Robert Pattinson
5120540	5122540	is the perfect actor for it
5122540	5124540	because he's a boy.
5124540	5126540	He's a slippery boy.
5126540	5128540	He's a Christian Bale
5128540	5130540	American Psycho-like
5130540	5132540	but without muckies.
5132540	5134540	A really slippery boy.
5134540	5136540	You look at him when he's wearing a suit
5136540	5138540	and you think, is he unsympathetic?
5138540	5140540	That's a rich,
5140540	5142540	shabby wessie footsie
5142540	5144540	who grew up with a golden spoon
5144540	5146540	and is a really disgusting wessie.
5146540	5148540	He got everything in shit
5148540	5150540	and doesn't need to do anything
5150540	5152540	and says, I earned it,
5152540	5154540	I got my status, I got it.
5154540	5156540	That's the movie.
5156540	5158540	That's the feeling you get
5158540	5160540	when you see this movie.
5160540	5162540	And when you see Robert Pattinson
5162540	5164540	when he shaved his ass.
5164540	5166540	That's my suggestion
5166540	5168540	because I like to think in these stereotypes.
5168540	5170540	And that's
5170540	5172540	definitely an interesting movie
5172540	5174540	because, as I said, that was the first movie
5174540	5176540	I think that was the movie after
5176540	5178540	this Twilight shit.
5178540	5180540	He already decided
5180540	5182540	to make serious movies that are kind of crazy.
5182540	5184540	And you have to expect that from him.
5184540	5186540	Sure, this shit with the vampires
5186540	5188540	he had to do
5188540	5190540	I mean, it's not bad.
5190540	5192540	You make a name, you earn money
5192540	5194540	that's mainstream.
5194540	5196540	But then the question is,
5196540	5198540	do you continue in the snowball system?
5198540	5200540	Or do you want to get even crazier
5200540	5202540	and make even more shit movies?
5202540	5204540	Or do you want to make interesting movies?
5204540	5206540	And I would expect that from him.
5206540	5208540	And as I said, all the movies
5208540	5210540	I've seen with him
5210540	5212540	made me think that he's a serious guy
5212540	5214540	who actually wants
5214540	5216540	real movie content.
5216540	5218540	I think that's great.
5218540	5220540	Cosmopolis.
5220540	5222540	And as I said,
5222540	5224540	you have to go
5224540	5226540	in the video description
5226540	5228540	and click on the link
5228540	5230540	so you can see the list,
5230540	5232540	the movie pilot list.
5232540	5234540	So, what does it say here?
5242540	5244540	Moneyboy is not satirical?
5244540	5246540	Yes, Moneyboy.
5246540	5248540	Like in the office.
5248540	5250540	When it started with the swag
5250540	5252540	and that's already a copy of another original.
5252540	5254540	There's a hip-hopper who thinks it's serious.
5254540	5256540	We also thought that it's a satire.
5256540	5258540	But he's also touring with it
5258540	5260540	and he's serious.
5260540	5262540	He goes on stage and he does it.
5262540	5264540	And there's the hip-hop crowd and they like it.
5264540	5266540	And he likes it too. He's a hip-hop person.
5266540	5268540	That's what I'm really talking about.
5268540	5270540	He also does interviews with hip-hop channels
5270540	5272540	and he lives this style.
5272540	5274540	He also wrote a bachelor or master's
5274540	5276540	about this topic with hip-hop
5276540	5278540	and how to market it.
5278540	5280540	I think that's an ambivalence.
5280540	5282540	He finds it interesting,
5282540	5284540	but he also focuses on the music.
5284540	5286540	I really think that
5286540	5288540	he's
5288540	5290540	in this respect
5290540	5292540	not a pure satire project
5292540	5294540	like Akan and Stefan, for example.
5294540	5296540	In case that tells you something.
5296540	5298540	I'm a kid from the 90s
5298540	5300540	so I know something like that.
5300540	5302540	Yes, Moneyboy. Of course he's from Switzerland.
5302540	5304540	No, Austria. I don't know.
5304540	5306540	Wait. Wien City.
5306540	5308540	He's from Wien City.
5308540	5310540	That's right. Hip-hop against the original class struggle.
5310540	5312540	The other two-packed songs are
5312540	5314540	disaster,
5314540	5316540	mainstream,
5316540	5318540	class struggle. There's still enough hip-hop.
5318540	5320540	I'm not an expert.
5320540	5322540	But apart from hip-hop,
5322540	5324540	Techno is a product made in Germany.
5324540	5326540	Yes, it can be.
5326540	5328540	I don't know them. I think they're super lame.
5328540	5330540	Mühmänner hören Techno.
5330540	5332540	I know enough people who aren't Mühmänner
5332540	5334540	who also listen to Techno.
5336540	5338540	In my opinion, this is the real musical
5338540	5340540	milestone of Germany
5340540	5342540	worldwide.
5342540	5344540	The real musical milestone
5344540	5346540	of Germany
5346540	5348540	worldwide.
5348540	5350540	First of all,
5350540	5352540	all the classical composers.
5352540	5354540	Sure, we don't need to talk about that.
5354540	5356540	Germany, super sick.
5356540	5358540	But then, Rammstein.
5358540	5360540	Lol.
5360540	5362540	Rammstein.
5362540	5364540	If someone is an exporter here,
5364540	5366540	then it's Rammstein.
5366540	5368540	And then, of course, there are
5368540	5370540	Scorpions.
5370540	5372540	Just from the scale of success,
5372540	5374540	Scorpions. And there are
5374540	5376540	a few other creators, for example.
5376540	5378540	In thrash metal, they're huge.
5378540	5380540	Or...
5380540	5382540	There are a few other really sick
5382540	5384540	German bands. Necrophagous
5384540	5386540	is, in my opinion, a purely German band.
5386540	5388540	But they're only in
5388540	5390540	tech desks, so to speak, legends.
5390540	5392540	But they have a legend status for that.
5392540	5394540	There are a lot of German bands
5394540	5396540	that are really sick. And techno.
5396540	5398540	I don't know much about that.
5398540	5400540	But I would have thought,
5400540	5402540	techno is identical all over the world.
5402540	5404540	And there is no
5404540	5406540	belonging to any artist
5406540	5408540	or so. I thought, you can't
5408540	5410540	distinguish that. That's such an
5410540	5412540	indistinguishable, analogue mass.
5412540	5414540	Whether you now take the techno song
5414540	5416540	that takes one and a half hours
5416540	5418540	from one, or party
5418540	5420540	on the other track
5420540	5422540	that takes one and a half hours or so.
5422540	5424540	I don't know. You'd have to tell me
5424540	5426540	which sick boys in techno
5426540	5428540	are really hard.
5428540	5430540	Kraftwerk or something. It could be.
5430540	5432540	But they're just...
5432540	5434540	They're actually pioneers.
5434540	5436540	I don't know if they're counted
5436540	5438540	as techno. I really don't know
5438540	5440540	much about that.
5448540	5450540	I, as an incoming engineer,
5450540	5452540	feel very offended by that.
5452540	5454540	Yes, well paid employee of
5454540	5456540	Antifa GmbH. I'm sorry.
5456540	5458540	But that's my
5458540	5460540	elitist pissbubble in which
5460540	5462540	I find myself. Because I just
5462540	5464540	have too much experience
5464540	5466540	with engineers. I'm
5466540	5468540	an incoming doctor engineer.
5468540	5470540	I'm myself. I'm also an engineer
5470540	5472540	on paper. And in my
5472540	5474540	last seven years I've only had to do
5474540	5476540	with engineers.
5476540	5478540	And that's my experience
5478540	5480540	that I have there.
5480540	5482540	Many of them can only blackbox.
5482540	5484540	What they can't do very much is
5484540	5486540	really apply mathematics.
5486540	5488540	Most of them can't even understand
5488540	5490540	what a Fourier transformation is.
5490540	5492540	They don't understand that. They have
5492540	5494540	mostly a symbolism. They can do that,
5494540	5496540	but they can't interpret it. And in my
5496540	5498540	exercises I see the inflation rate
5498540	5500540	really brutal. I do exercises for
5500540	5502540	engineers. Medical technology.
5502540	5504540	That's essentially electrical engineering.
5504540	5506540	And for a while I've only had the
5506540	5508540	electrical engineer and medical engineer.
5508540	5510540	They come from a school and
5510540	5512540	two weeks before the school starts
5512540	5514540	they do math preparation.
5514540	5516540	But that's essentially
5516540	5518540	what the Abitur doesn't do anymore.
5518540	5520540	But what you need to get to the university.
5520540	5522540	And there you can see how brutal
5522540	5524540	that is.
5524540	5526540	And it continues.
5526540	5528540	It doesn't get any better.
5528540	5530540	Then master students come out
5530540	5532540	who are sitting in an exam
5532540	5534540	with me. Electrical engineering.
5534540	5536540	They don't write down the Roman law.
5536540	5538540	That's super ridiculous. But classical
5538540	5540540	is just Fourier analysis.
5540540	5542540	Normal...
5542540	5544540	I don't know. Normal
5544540	5546540	functional theory I don't want to say.
5546540	5548540	But algebra, so to speak.
5548540	5550540	The nearest algebra.
5550540	5552540	I only see deficits everywhere.
5552540	5554540	And that's
5554540	5556540	for some reason
5556540	5558540	the problem is huge for engineers.
5558540	5560540	And for physicists
5560540	5562540	And the mathematicians
5562540	5564540	I had to deal with until now,
5564540	5566540	didn't.
5566540	5568540	But that's a very personal
5568540	5570540	view of me.
5570540	5572540	Of course that can be different
5572540	5574540	on the big scale.
5574540	5576540	But that's what I see.
5576540	5578540	That the engineer
5578540	5580540	is more of a low-level
5580540	5582540	flat wanker.
5582540	5584540	And of course it can be that you're a
5584540	5586540	crazy boy and a crazy dude and just want to use it
5586540	5588540	and that's why you're an engineer.
5588540	5590540	But that's not a thing.
5590540	5592540	Nothing wrong with it.
5592540	5594540	I only say what I see
5594540	5596540	that I don't like about the nerds.
5596540	5598540	But I think that's just alienation
5598540	5600540	and inflation. They can't do anything for the people.
5600540	5602540	So.
5602540	5604540	Geology.
5604540	5606540	No. Philosophers are so sexy
5606540	5608540	that the will to profit against them
5608540	5610540	stinks like rotten eggs.
5610540	5612540	Yes, definitely. Philosophy is really nice.
5614540	5616540	But...
5616540	5618540	It's just...
5618540	5620540	You can't earn your bread
5620540	5622540	with philosophy.
5622540	5624540	Unless you're a really awesome...
5624540	5626540	David Garrett I almost said
5626540	5628540	Richard David Precht or something like that.
5628540	5630540	Who sells books and always
5630540	5632540	holds himself in a camera because he's such a cool boy
5632540	5634540	and has a bunch of groups and can do marketing.
5634540	5636540	People like that can live well with it.
5636540	5638540	So a few freaks who live in the media
5638540	5640540	can live well with their philosophy
5640540	5642540	or a few thinkers who
5642540	5644540	really
5644540	5646540	stick out with their thoughts.
5646540	5648540	Otherwise you can do almost nothing with philosophy.
5648540	5650540	Those are the ones who arrived at the top
5650540	5652540	in the hierarchy. They can't grow higher
5652540	5654540	in their local snowball system
5654540	5656540	as a philosopher. You could
5656540	5658540	at most become a Habeck-type.
5658540	5660540	He's also a philosopher. Then you'll become a chancellor.
5660540	5662540	Or...
5662540	5664540	You just go around in some local
5664540	5666540	universities and you're lucky and get a job.
5666540	5668540	But it's clear that it doesn't work with
5668540	5670540	everyone because there are way too many
5670540	5672540	graduates and way too few
5672540	5674540	applications for people like that.
5674540	5676540	You just have to do something else.
5676540	5678540	Of course you can say, I'm a writer
5678540	5680540	and a web designer and a philosopher
5680540	5682540	academically. You've got a paper on it
5682540	5684540	and I've studied something and I'm doing something completely different.
5684540	5686540	That works. I'm also a physicist and I could
5686540	5688540	apply for everything. I could
5688540	5690540	become a consultant
5690540	5692540	or I could do something.
5692540	5694540	I could become a software representative.
5694540	5696540	I could write offers
5696540	5698540	or sell something
5698540	5700540	or something like that. You could do
5700540	5702540	everything. But as a
5702540	5704540	philosopher
5704540	5706540	it's difficult to do something like that.
5716540	5718540	Hatred on money-elite
5718540	5720540	phyre KIZ
5720540	5722540	I eat rich.
5726540	5728540	A Christmas story
5728540	5730540	and the chocolate factory.
5730540	5732540	Is a Christmas story
5732540	5734540	some kind of family story
5734540	5736540	with these weird shit amis?
5736540	5738540	Could be.
5742540	5744540	Corona, however,
5744540	5746540	holds the record of the most
5746540	5748540	devoured brain areas.
5748540	5750540	I don't know. I would say
5750540	5752540	alcohol is quite good.
5752540	5754540	And of course the normal
5754540	5756540	Infotainment mainstream.
5756540	5758540	But it also destroys a lot of brain areas.
5758540	5760540	Especially with the children
5760540	5762540	that are growing up now.
5762540	5764540	If you grow up with two years
5764540	5766540	with a screen in front of your face
5766540	5768540	then you are too much
5768540	5770540	in your head with ten.
5770540	5772540	Nothing can develop cognitively.
5776540	5778540	Techno comes from Germany.
5778540	5780540	Sven Wett.
5780540	5782540	The engineer
5782540	5784540	is not so difficult.
5784540	5786540	Okay, I'll write that down for later.
5788540	5790540	Then I have it somewhere else.
5790540	5792540	You never know.
5800540	5802540	Marosha Blümchen
5802540	5804540	Okay, yes, I remember.
5804540	5806540	Blümchen was hardcore techno, right?
5806540	5808540	It was really upda upda.
5808540	5810540	Like a boom boom boom boom boom
5810540	5812540	boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
5812540	5814540	Yes, that's right. That was funny.
5814540	5816540	But rather Gawa. Yes, definitely
5816540	5818540	I am fully involved. If already, then already.
5818540	5820540	What comes to my mind
5820540	5822540	is Rotterdamer Terror Corpse.
5822540	5824540	Does anyone know that?
5824540	5826540	That was really hardcore in my opinion.
5826540	5828540	But that has to be like that
5828540	5830540	in the direction, right?
5832540	5834540	The university generation
5834540	5836540	Student course.
5836540	5838540	Which generation do you mean?
5842540	5844540	This university generation.
5844540	5846540	Well, he obviously means those who are currently studying.
5846540	5848540	Right now, at this moment.
5848540	5850540	So all those who were
5850540	5852540	matriculated at the latest
5852540	5854540	five years ago
5854540	5856540	or are currently matriculated.
5856540	5858540	Function theory for every analysis
5858540	5860540	I'm doing right now and I find it mega exciting.
5860540	5862540	I also want to apply
5862540	5864540	and wanted to be an inventor since my childhood.
5864540	5866540	Yes, that's definitely a cool setting.
5866540	5868540	Then I wish you
5868540	5870540	that you find a good professor
5870540	5872540	with whom you can write
5872540	5874540	real final work.
5874540	5876540	I have the impression that this is a huge problem.
5876540	5878540	Due to this massive alienation, people
5878540	5880540	no longer want to go out on serious topics
5880540	5882540	and struggle with teaching.
5882540	5884540	But if you find something cool there
5884540	5886540	maybe in a company with an application
5886540	5888540	that is often possible with engineers
5888540	5890540	that you go to a company for which you work
5890540	5892540	they benefit from it.
5892540	5894540	You write a work about it. The professor is happy.
5894540	5896540	It has something to do with applications.
5896540	5898540	It is something unique. It is a real project
5898540	5900540	because it is unique and can not be repeated.
5900540	5902540	If you have fun with it, it is great.
5902540	5904540	The gain of knowledge is maximum
5904540	5906540	because you can apply your mathematical knowledge.
5910540	5912540	Morph. What does it look like
5912540	5914540	with group talking?
5914540	5916540	That is brown and knocks against
5916540	5918540	what is brown and knocks against the glass?
5920540	5922540	I do not know.
5924540	5926540	When I shit on your mother's face
5926540	5928540	she then knocks against my glass
5928540	5930540	and asks herself
5930540	5932540	why did you do that?
5944540	5946540	Techno is not mine at all.
5946540	5948540	I do not know anything about it.
5952540	5954540	This is a rich man with the three ghosts.
5954540	5956540	This is Ebenezer Scrooge.
5960540	5962540	Ebenezer Scrooge.
5962540	5964540	Then I arrived down here.
5964540	5966540	Then we can continue in the list.
5966540	5968540	Next film.
5968540	5970540	I just saw it. It is called Eye for Eye.
5970540	5972540	Christian Bale main role
5972540	5974540	and a lot of other great actors.
5974540	5976540	The film is full of great actors
5976540	5978540	such as Woody Harrelson
5978540	5980540	aka natural born killers
5980540	5982540	or
5982540	5984540	Forest Whitaker
5984540	5986540	and super cool film.
5988540	5990540	The film is so cool
5990540	5992540	because he
5994540	5996540	tells the story
5996540	5998540	a bit like Good Times
5998540	6000540	on this lower income layer.
6002540	6004540	Christian Bale is a worker
6004540	6006540	in a steel factory.
6006540	6008540	His father is just dying
6008540	6010540	because of the impacts
6010540	6012540	that he has had on the dams
6012540	6014540	during his life in the steel factory.
6014540	6016540	This is the context.
6016540	6018540	He has to work
6018540	6020540	to get over the rounds.
6020540	6022540	The metal factory
6022540	6024540	that he works in is going to be closed.
6024540	6026540	It is like a robot.
6026540	6028540	There was prosperity
6028540	6030540	but it is gone now.
6030540	6032540	Everywhere everything is dirty.
6032540	6034540	Everything is shit and dirty.
6034540	6036540	I also stand on it.
6036540	6038540	I stand on it when everything is dirty.
6038540	6040540	When I was in Istanbul
6040540	6042540	it was great.
6042540	6044540	I stood on it because everything was dirty.
6044540	6046540	I walked around with my wife in Peking.
6046540	6048540	Everything was dirty.
6048540	6050540	I stand on the big cities that are dirty.
6050540	6052540	When it is dirty and shit
6052540	6054540	you feel that there are still people
6054540	6056540	who have a struggle
6056540	6058540	and know how shitty life is.
6058540	6060540	I feel much better
6060540	6062540	when you sit in a bar
6062540	6064540	and eat the rotten fries
6064540	6066540	and see how people live there.
6066540	6068540	I think that is much more authentic
6068540	6070540	and you still feel life.
6070540	6072540	It is not like in Singapore
6072540	6074540	or Dubai where everything is clean
6074540	6076540	and clean.
6076540	6078540	We are in the upper 10%
6078540	6080540	of the pyramid.
6080540	6082540	Everything is fine here.
6082540	6084540	You notice this difference
6084540	6086540	when you are somewhere.
6086540	6088540	This difference is clear
6088540	6090540	in this movie.
6090540	6092540	Everything is dirty.
6092540	6094540	Christian Bale is a nice boy.
6094540	6096540	He is being sold.
6096540	6098540	He is being portrayed as a nice protagonist.
6098540	6100540	He is an honorable man.
6100540	6102540	He doesn't let himself be blamed.
6102540	6104540	He works honestly for his money.
6104540	6106540	He has this attitude.
6106540	6108540	He goes hunting.
6108540	6110540	But he doesn't kill the deer
6110540	6112540	because he doesn't like it.
6112540	6114540	He did that with the rifle.
6114540	6116540	But then he thinks he doesn't need to shoot.
6116540	6118540	He doesn't care.
6118540	6120540	You notice that Christian Bale
6120540	6122540	is a nice character.
6122540	6124540	He is being portrayed.
6124540	6126540	You have to think about
6126540	6128540	what kind of a dude he is.
6128540	6130540	He is not an aggro guy.
6130540	6132540	But he knows how to defend himself
6132540	6134540	against the fun he has.
6134540	6136540	Everything is great.
6136540	6138540	Then something happens.
6138540	6140540	He drives
6140540	6142540	along a street
6142540	6144540	and there is a bad exit.
6144540	6146540	Someone hits a car.
6146540	6148540	He kills a child
6148540	6150540	or a mother, I don't know.
6150540	6152540	He kills two people.
6152540	6154540	That's why he goes to jail.
6154540	6156540	Then his life breaks.
6156540	6158540	In the USA it is always on fire.
6158540	6160540	If you can't work for a month
6160540	6162540	everything goes bad.
6162540	6164540	No money, your wife disappears.
6164540	6166540	He goes to jail.
6166540	6168540	His wife disappears.
6168540	6170540	His father dies by accident.
6170540	6172540	His brother
6172540	6174540	goes on the wrong track.
6174540	6176540	His brother has a similar problem.
6176540	6178540	He is poor, but he doesn't want to work in the steelworks.
6178540	6180540	What does he do?
6180540	6182540	He goes to the army.
6182540	6184540	That's the American dream.
6184540	6186540	Sell your life.
6186540	6188540	He goes to the army.
6188540	6190540	He is four times in Iraq.
6190540	6192540	He is traumatized.
6192540	6194540	He has post-traumatic stress disorder.
6194540	6196540	He is really bad.
6196540	6198540	The only thing he can do
6198540	6200540	when he comes back
6200540	6202540	is to call himself a prostitute.
6202540	6204540	But you don't call it that.
6204540	6206540	You call it that.
6206540	6208540	You do cage fights.
6208540	6210540	You fight with other boys.
6210540	6212540	Then you go to sports.
6212540	6214540	There are fighters who beat you to death.
6214540	6216540	It doesn't matter.
6216540	6218540	Illegal fights.
6218540	6220540	Same thing as prostitution
6220540	6222540	on the male-male level.
6224540	6226540	The nice thing about the movie
6226540	6228540	is that it is there again.
6230540	6232540	It is presented as it is.
6232540	6234540	Everyone in this movie
6234540	6236540	no matter if they are
6236540	6238540	at the top of the hierarchy
6238540	6240540	they all have an unhappy life.
6240540	6242540	They all lead an unhappy life.
6242540	6244540	None of them can claim
6244540	6246540	that he is good at it.
6246540	6248540	Even Woody Harrelson
6248540	6250540	who is the craziest boy
6250540	6252540	of all these motherfuckers
6252540	6254540	who leads the freest life of all.
6254540	6256540	Even he is permanently
6256540	6258540	dissatisfied and pisses.
6258540	6260540	He has to take drugs all the time
6260540	6262540	because everything around him
6262540	6264540	is disgusting and disgusting.
6264540	6266540	And he himself is disgusting and disgusting.
6266540	6268540	And that's just great.
6268540	6270540	The movie is there again.
6270540	6272540	That's a movie where I say
6272540	6274540	yes, wonderful.
6274540	6276540	He puts his finger right in the wound.
6276540	6278540	How shitty the world is
6278540	6280540	especially over there in the American dream.
6280540	6282540	I don't even know where it is.
6282540	6284540	I think it's said Michigan or something.
6286540	6288540	There must be exactly the situation
6288540	6290540	when the baby boomers were there
6290540	6292540	and you could work hard for your
6292540	6294540	life and so on.
6294540	6296540	And now all the factories are closing
6296540	6298540	and he also says in between
6298540	6300540	because it's cheaper in China to buy steel
6300540	6302540	than to produce it here.
6302540	6304540	And what always strikes me
6304540	6306540	when I see a movie like this
6306540	6308540	that is now on the topic
6308540	6310540	is this debate
6310540	6312540	that is currently being led here
6312540	6314540	with the windmills because
6314540	6316540	they pollute our landscape.
6316540	6318540	That's super ridiculous.
6318540	6320540	Fuck the landscape.
6320540	6322540	There's a windmill.
6322540	6324540	Do you have a problem that you can't
6324540	6326540	draw a picture because it doesn't
6326540	6328540	look like it was 100 years ago?
6328540	6330540	Our world is changing
6330540	6332540	and we as humans are changing our world.
6332540	6334540	That's nothing new.
6334540	6336540	And to put windmills there
6336540	6338540	is a weakness because of aesthetics.
6338540	6340540	I never understood that.
6340540	6342540	But the normal industrialization
6342540	6344540	makes it out of itself anyway.
6344540	6346540	In the middle of nature, there's a
6346540	6348540	super cool valley, there are mountains,
6348540	6350540	everything could be super nice, but everywhere
6350540	6352540	are some rails laid, some
6352540	6354540	cobblestones, everything is super
6354540	6356540	dirty, everything is some kind of fleece bands,
6356540	6358540	everything looks shit, there's some metal
6358540	6360540	scrap lying around everywhere, some shitty
6360540	6362540	cars that are no longer driven and so on.
6362540	6364540	And that is the normal degree
6364540	6366540	of pollution that capitalism
6366540	6368540	favors with our environment and our
6368540	6370540	nature. So talking about aesthetics
6370540	6372540	doesn't take place anyway and
6372540	6374540	that's a good point.
6374540	6376540	And of course,
6376540	6378540	it's a revenge movie and I'm
6378540	6380540	totally against revenge movies because
6380540	6382540	it takes away my lowest instincts.
6382540	6384540	Just because, of course,
6384540	6386540	Christian Bale's brother
6386540	6388540	is being killed
6388540	6390540	by Woody Harrelson because he's a
6390540	6392540	stupid mafia wanker who says
6392540	6394540	you owe me and I'll kill you all.
6394540	6396540	And Woody Harrelson is generally
6396540	6398540	a crazy dude who kills everyone
6398540	6400540	he doesn't want to kill anymore.
6400540	6402540	Well, and Christian Bale
6402540	6404540	is a calm guy all the time
6404540	6406540	but he has
6406540	6408540	enough of it and
6408540	6410540	now he has to go through it
6410540	6412540	and he just makes him cold.
6412540	6414540	And that's a nice
6414540	6416540	story. It's just a nice
6416540	6418540	story about the
6418540	6420540	situation that you actually ask yourself
6420540	6422540	what kind of choice do people have
6422540	6424540	who are still living there?
6424540	6426540	In what kind of world were they born
6426540	6428540	there? And that's the first world.
6428540	6430540	There you should actually say
6430540	6432540	okay, there should actually be a
6432540	6434540	solidarity community that makes sure
6434540	6436540	that people can become something else
6436540	6438540	apart from steel workers and drug dealers.
6438540	6440540	But that's being shown there
6440540	6442540	because the other option, the alternative
6442540	6444540	is to become a policeman and the drug
6444540	6446540	dealers and other spas just chase them.
6446540	6448540	What is not shown
6448540	6450540	is, so to speak, you could go to a
6450540	6452540	university or something, but that just doesn't exist because
6452540	6454540	it's somewhere in the province. And of course
6454540	6456540	everyone has this rotten idea
6456540	6458540	of homeland love and patriotism
6458540	6460540	and work honestly
6460540	6462540	for your money and all this
6462540	6464540	work fetish that is being
6464540	6466540	poured into these Americans.
6466540	6468540	All these contradictions
6468540	6470540	are well represented in the film.
6470540	6472540	Even if the film doesn't directly
6472540	6474540	address it. And that's why
6474540	6476540	I would say it's a good film about capitalism.
6486540	6488540	Hmm...
6490540	6492540	Yes, his beard already has a beard.
6494540	6496540	You're talking about some insiders, aren't you?
6496540	6498540	I can't start anything with them.
6498540	6500540	I'm still in elementary school,
6500540	6502540	so I still have a little bit
6502540	6504540	ahead of me, but I
6504540	6506540	will remember your words
6506540	6508540	and will look after a
6508540	6510540	good professional or a good
6510540	6512540	business. Yes, that
6512540	6514540	definitely has to be the case.
6514540	6516540	For the engineers, this is very important.
6516540	6518540	I would even say that
6518540	6520540	this is the most important thing.
6520540	6522540	That's where you make the most experience.
6522540	6524540	Because
6524540	6526540	especially in engineering studies
6526540	6528540	I've always had the impression that
6528540	6530540	the teaching...
6530540	6532540	Okay,
6532540	6534540	that can also be different from
6534540	6536540	university to university.
6536540	6538540	It's probably better if you're at
6538540	6540540	Humboldt University or Erlangen than
6540540	6542540	if you're at a provincial university.
6542540	6544540	But still, especially because the
6544540	6546540	engineering studies are
6546540	6548540	related to their practice,
6548540	6550540	this is of course important.
6550540	6552540	And
6552540	6554540	among us, you learn the most.
6554540	6556540	That's the only
6556540	6558540	time that you're really
6558540	6560540	self-reliant and have to solve problems.
6560540	6562540	At least that would be the best.
6562540	6564540	That's the ideal case. You get a problem
6564540	6566540	that is so moderated that you can
6566540	6568540	create it yourself and then
6568540	6570540	solve it with mathematics.
6570540	6572540	For example,
6572540	6574540	I had a friend who was
6574540	6576540	in the university for a long time and
6576540	6578540	then studied electrical engineering.
6578540	6580540	He's in the same situation now.
6580540	6582540	He's just doing that now
6582540	6584540	at companies.
6584540	6586540	And he's really getting into it.
6586540	6588540	I have the impression that
6588540	6590540	it's definitely much better than
6590540	6592540	studying 08.15 and then
6592540	6594540	writing a good bachelor's degree.
6594540	6596540	Because I've seen that too.
6596540	6598540	I see a lot of engineers
6598540	6600540	who are of course completely alienated.
6600540	6602540	And I can't tell anyone that they're doing a good job afterwards.
6602540	6604540	They will only do a good job somewhere later.
6604540	6606540	You know, they will do this experience
6606540	6608540	at most, if they're lucky,
6608540	6610540	after graduation. But you should actually
6610540	6612540	do that in your studies. You should experience it in your studies
6612540	6614540	alone to know
6614540	6616540	if that's actually something for you.
6616540	6618540	That's a kind of fireball.
6618540	6620540	And that's what belongs in an education.
6620540	6622540	So that afterwards someone comes out
6622540	6624540	who can really
6624540	6626540	go into a room
6626540	6628540	and say, hey,
6628540	6630540	I'm the crazy boy.
6630540	6632540	I can solve these problems.
6632540	6634540	You're the management guys.
6634540	6636540	You're the guy with the PR.
6636540	6638540	You're the one who's the operator
6638540	6640540	and calculates the numbers.
6640540	6642540	But I'm doing the content here.
6642540	6644540	I'm taking care of the content.
6644540	6646540	That's what the engineer should be able to do.
6646540	6648540	And I have the impression that
6648540	6650540	there are far too few people
6650540	6652540	who can still do that
6652540	6654540	after graduation.
6654540	6656540	But that's the way it is. And now in my
6656540	6658540	support I see that quite often.
6658540	6660540	I have about 50-50 students,
6660540	6662540	50% students and 50% people
6662540	6664540	who are at the university.
6664540	6666540	And what can I say?
6666540	6668540	They're almost all engineers, of course.
6668540	6670540	I don't do math
6670540	6672540	because I can't do that
6672540	6674540	with the proofs and the words
6674540	6676540	and the vocabulary, because I'm not a mathematician myself.
6676540	6678540	Only very rarely can I help with that.
6678540	6680540	But otherwise
6680540	6682540	they're almost all engineers.
6682540	6684540	I also have some financial problems,
6684540	6686540	but I don't want to talk about them to the engineers.
6698540	6700540	Where did we end up?
6700540	6702540	Next movie.
6702540	6704540	The Drop Bargeld.
6704540	6706540	That's what it's called in German.
6706540	6708540	The Drop Bargeld.
6708540	6710540	And I also saw the movie last time.
6710540	6712540	First of all, it's with Tom Hardy.
6712540	6714540	That's great.
6714540	6716540	He's with the guy from
6716540	6718540	Sopranos.
6718540	6720540	I think that's the same guy.
6726540	6728540	The movie is also
6728540	6730540	almost a
6730540	6732540	horror thriller, but
6732540	6734540	very different.
6734540	6736540	Tom Hardy
6736540	6738540	is the main character
6738540	6740540	and he lives in a city
6740540	6742540	and he works as a waiter.
6742540	6744540	He does a very
6744540	6746540	simple job.
6746540	6748540	And he doesn't want to have anything to do
6748540	6750540	with the mafia,
6750540	6752540	which is everywhere.
6752540	6754540	And you notice all the time
6754540	6756540	that he is
6756540	6758540	someone who
6758540	6760540	doesn't want to have anything to do with them,
6760540	6762540	but doesn't have a problem
6762540	6764540	with it
6764540	6766540	if he gets pissed,
6766540	6768540	that he could
6768540	6770540	somehow finish the people.
6770540	6772540	But he doesn't do it.
6772540	6774540	He leaves it all behind.
6774540	6776540	He doesn't try to have any interaction
6776540	6778540	with this parallel world,
6778540	6780540	he just wants to earn money
6780540	6782540	and live, and he doesn't know
6782540	6784540	what he wants to do.
6784540	6786540	You have this feeling that he's up to something,
6786540	6788540	but it's not said if he's up to something
6788540	6790540	or if he doesn't know what he wants to do,
6790540	6792540	but you are thrown into this setting.
6792540	6794540	And then one day
6794540	6796540	a dog in a trash can
6796540	6798540	which wasn't meant for him
6798540	6800540	turns out to be
6800540	6802540	a complicated method
6802540	6804540	of making a psycho into a troller.
6804540	6806540	But he gets involved
6806540	6808540	in the story of a psycho
6808540	6810540	who wants to become a troller
6810540	6812540	and he falls in love with the troller
6812540	6814540	or the troller falls in love with him
6814540	6816540	and then there is an interaction
6816540	6818540	and the guy is a psycho
6818540	6820540	and a criminal and he
6820540	6822540	threatens everyone with death.
6822540	6824540	And it's like this,
6826540	6828540	the guy who owns the bar
6828540	6830540	in which he works,
6830540	6832540	he has weird things going on
6832540	6834540	and the bar is always used
6834540	6836540	as a drop.
6836540	6838540	That means the mafia boys
6838540	6840540	somehow store money
6840540	6842540	between them in the evening
6842540	6844540	and then get it a few hours later.
6844540	6846540	So that some of the suppliers
6846540	6848540	drop the money they made
6848540	6850540	through their drug sales
6850540	6852540	and then someone else comes
6852540	6854540	and takes it away.
6854540	6856540	That's the model.
6856540	6858540	I don't know if he gets some profit
6858540	6860540	or if it's just money.
6860540	6862540	Anyway, this film lives in this world
6862540	6864540	and it's a side-effect
6864540	6866540	an interesting side-effect
6866540	6868540	because it changes things a little bit.
6868540	6870540	The guy tries
6870540	6872540	to trick the mafia
6872540	6874540	and you know it's a bad idea
6874540	6876540	and they really kick you out.
6876540	6878540	The boy gets really pissed
6878540	6880540	and it's a little bit Romanian
6880540	6882540	and it's also represented a little bit
6882540	6884540	and a little bit of everyday racism
6884540	6886540	is also put in there, that's all funny.
6886540	6888540	My cat is barking, I'll get her in.
6900540	6902540	The nice thing about this film is
6902540	6904540	Tom Hardy is,
6904540	6906540	we all know him,
6906540	6908540	he's the coolest Pumperboy
6908540	6910540	who could destroy everyone in the world
6910540	6912540	if he wanted to.
6912540	6914540	And you think all the time,
6914540	6916540	but that's Tom Hardy, why doesn't he destroy him?
6916540	6918540	But he doesn't.
6918540	6920540	He's a very chill, very chill boy.
6922540	6924540	At the end of the film
6924540	6926540	there's a conflict
6926540	6928540	over a
6928540	6930540	masculine
6930540	6932540	boy-legend story
6932540	6934540	that represents
6934540	6936540	a big lie
6936540	6938540	and he knows it all the time
6938540	6940540	but he plays along
6940540	6942540	because he really doesn't want
6942540	6944540	to have anything to do with it.
6944540	6946540	And the story comes out
6946540	6948540	that if he has to
6948540	6950540	and is forced to,
6950540	6952540	he pulls it through and makes people cold.
6952540	6954540	But you're not playing with the shit
6954540	6956540	that's lying on the floor, are you?
6964540	6966540	The cat gets annoyed,
6966540	6968540	comes in
6968540	6970540	and then gets annoyed on the floor.
6970540	6972540	I like that.
6972540	6974540	Anyway, Tom Hardy
6974540	6976540	turns out to be a really cool motherfucker
6976540	6978540	at the end of the film,
6978540	6980540	makes him cold, takes the princess with him
6980540	6982540	and happy end.
6982540	6984540	That's basically the story.
6984540	6986540	And the cool thing is,
6986540	6988540	all the time there's a bully
6988540	6990540	that he knows from church
6990540	6992540	and he also has a funny role
6992540	6994540	but he can't do anything.
6994540	6996540	He can only look at these mafia structures
6996540	6998540	and somehow
6998540	7000540	don't really intervene
7000540	7002540	because it's clear, the bullies are powerless.
7002540	7004540	And in the end, the bully
7004540	7006540	also gives him the props
7006540	7008540	because you're a really cool boy.
7008540	7010540	And Tom Hardy of course doesn't say anything about it.
7010540	7012540	And it's just
7012540	7014540	all these structures
7014540	7016540	and also how the business runs
7016540	7018540	because mafia is of course also just a business.
7018540	7020540	It shows how these two parallel worlds work
7020540	7022540	and that's often the case
7022540	7024540	in these gangster films.
7024540	7026540	That you have these parallel worlds
7026540	7028540	where you have this bully world
7028540	7030540	that somehow does the legal way
7030540	7032540	and there are also business models
7032540	7034540	included and there's corruption too.
7034540	7036540	And then there's the complete
7036540	7038540	illegality where
7038540	7040540	mafia structures work exactly
7040540	7042540	according to the same scheme.
7042540	7044540	The snowball system is always the same,
7044540	7046540	you always have the same hierarchies,
7046540	7048540	they're just called differently,
7048540	7050540	and then it's corrupt and
7050540	7052540	there's something going on and so on.
7052540	7054540	It's always like that.
7054540	7056540	It's always done like that.
7056540	7058540	And that's why I think this film
7058540	7060540	is so cool and that's why it talks about
7060540	7062540	capitalism because
7062540	7064540	with the existence
7064540	7066540	of these people
7066540	7068540	it shows them,
7068540	7070540	it shows how they live there
7070540	7072540	under what conditions they live there
7072540	7074540	and also
7074540	7076540	people like
7076540	7078540	Tom Hardy
7078540	7080540	can develop their own morals
7080540	7082540	or a codex
7082540	7084540	according to which they can live.
7084540	7086540	Life has made them tough, but they still have
7086540	7088540	a moral codex. And many don't have that.
7088540	7090540	You have to imagine
7090540	7092540	Tom Hardy is absolutely
7092540	7094540	unique in how he's
7094540	7096540	portrayed because a normal person
7096540	7098540	wouldn't behave like that. A normal person
7098540	7100540	would have given up much earlier and would have been
7100540	7102540	crushed. Tom Hardy is
7102540	7104540	portrayed as someone who has
7104540	7106540	a very high resilience,
7106540	7108540	a very high character strength
7108540	7110540	compared to this external
7110540	7112540	influence and
7114540	7116540	influence, so to speak, that
7116540	7118540	influence him.
7118540	7120540	And that shows how difficult it is,
7120540	7122540	how difficult it is to grow up there and to act like that
7122540	7124540	and to become an upright citizen or
7124540	7126540	to do something great.
7126540	7128540	What's going on with the cat? It's completely
7128540	7130540	rusting out here, isn't it? It can't be crazy.
7130540	7132540	What's going on?
7132540	7134540	Emmy?
7136540	7138540	Where are you?
7140540	7142540	Do you want to get out?
7152540	7154540	Yes, Departed is also a movie, of course.
7154540	7156540	By the way, Departed is
7156540	7158540	a remake. You should all know that.
7158540	7160540	The original
7160540	7162540	movie is called Internal Fias
7162540	7164540	and has more than one part.
7164540	7166540	And we all
7166540	7168540	got into it really well.
7168540	7170540	And Departed is really
7170540	7172540	copied one by one. It's a real,
7172540	7174540	real remake for the American market.
7174540	7176540	Because of casualization.
7176540	7178540	The people in the mainstream can't take
7178540	7180540	these Asian faces off. They can't.
7180540	7182540	Asian movies can't watch them,
7182540	7184540	can they? They have a different
7184540	7186540	gestic, they have a different habitus.
7186540	7188540	You can't sell that to people.
7188540	7190540	And that's what Bo Jin Ho did
7190540	7192540	really well with Snowpiercer, that he
7192540	7194540	bought some Americans for it. Because
7194540	7196540	otherwise he could never have such a success
7196540	7198540	with the movie. With Snowpiercer.
7198540	7200540	Because of this wickedness.
7200540	7202540	People can't do that.
7202540	7204540	I mean, people can't watch
7204540	7206540	German or French or Spanish
7206540	7208540	productions in peace. They get
7208540	7210540	a scratch somehow. And for the American market
7210540	7212540	it's not even there. They have to
7212540	7214540	remake everything again.
7214540	7216540	And Departed is one of these remakes
7216540	7218540	where everyone says, this is such a cool movie.
7218540	7220540	But fuck you, dude. It's just a Korean movie.
7220540	7222540	I think it's Korean.
7224540	7226540	Infernal Envy, definitely.
7226540	7228540	And as I said, not even that bad.
7228540	7230540	Not even that bad.
7230540	7232540	You know.
7232540	7234540	And where we're already at, Asian movies.
7238540	7240540	I Saw the Devil. Super movie.
7240540	7242540	Then of course
7242540	7244540	Oldboy. Of course it also has an American
7244540	7246540	remake by now.
7246540	7248540	Oldboy. Super strong movie.
7248540	7250540	And what did we see last time?
7250540	7252540	A really cool movie. I think
7252540	7254540	The Audition.
7254540	7256540	Or
7256540	7258540	Geständnisse. I still find that out.
7258540	7260540	I still find that out.
7260540	7262540	I quickly check
7262540	7264540	the movie pilots.
7264540	7266540	I quickly find that out.
7266540	7268540	I just have to look at the first page.
7268540	7270540	They are all very well rated by me.
7270540	7272540	So, and
7272540	7274540	So, and
7274540	7276540	So, what did I have already?
7276540	7278540	I Saw the Devil
7278540	7280540	I Saw the Devil already.
7280540	7282540	Then
7282540	7284540	Oldboy, I already said that.
7284540	7286540	Oldboy, I already said that.
7300540	7302540	Infernal Enviers
7302540	7304540	Infernal Enviers
7304540	7306540	Infernal Enviers has a 9.5
7306540	7308540	Infernal Enviers has a 9.5
7308540	7310540	Departed also has a 9.5
7310540	7312540	I see that Departed is
7312540	7314540	USA and Hong Kong.
7314540	7316540	That means the Chinese
7316540	7318540	added Hitler.
7318540	7320540	They added some money to it.
7320540	7322540	Adaption? No, that's not it.
7322540	7324540	What does the movie
7324540	7326540	Confessions
7326540	7328540	Confessions mean?
7328540	7330540	So
7334540	7336540	Confessions
7354540	7356540	Oh no
7356540	7358540	What is it?
7362540	7364540	I think it's called Audition.
7364540	7366540	The movie was
7366540	7368540	really nice.
7370540	7372540	This is an Asian movie from Japan.
7372540	7374540	I really liked it.
7374540	7376540	Is that the one
7376540	7378540	where the
7378540	7380540	movie
7380540	7382540	movie
7382540	7384540	movie
7384540	7386540	movie
7386540	7388540	movie
7388540	7390540	movie
7390540	7392540	nice but it's not the one
7392540	7394540	I mean
7394540	7396540	Woman, tell me if you are still
7396540	7398540	online. What was the name
7398540	7400540	of the movie where the teacher
7400540	7402540	claims she infected everyone with AIDS?
7404540	7406540	What was the name?
7406540	7409540	I thought it was called Confession.
7412540	7414540	I have to search again.
7419540	7422540	I think it was from Japan.
7436540	7447540	No, that's not what it's called. I can't remember.
7447540	7451540	I can't see it in my history.
7451540	7453540	The problem is, it's not compatible.
7453540	7458540	Sometimes I didn't rate the movies.
7458540	7462540	And then they're just gone.
7462540	7467540	Then they disappeared in the Nirvana of Bits and Bytes.
7467540	7470540	The movies.
7470540	7474540	What was it called? It can't be.
7474540	7478540	It was a Japanese movie.
7478540	7481540	I'm just going to google it now.
7481540	7484540	Japanese movie.
7484540	7487540	Woman puts on AIDS.
7487540	7491540	And then somehow confessions.
7491540	7492540	Right.
7492540	7497540	Japanese. The movie is called German title. Confessions from 2010.
7497540	7501540	And then I just searched for it. Confessions or what?
7501540	7504540	It can't be or what?
7506540	7507540	So.
7507540	7510540	It comes right into the list.
7510540	7512540	Confessions.
7512540	7515540	No, no, it's not called Confessions. It's called...
7515540	7516540	Fuck.
7516540	7520540	It's called Confessions. Original title. Koku Haku.
7520540	7523540	This movie is really awesome.
7523540	7527540	I liked it. I gave it a new one. I just didn't find it.
7527540	7529540	Confessions.
7529540	7532540	No, it doesn't belong in the list.
7532540	7534540	Because it's not a film about capitalism.
7534540	7536540	I just wanted to show Asian movies.
7536540	7541540	This movie is awesome. You can give it a try.
7541540	7544540	So.
7544540	7546540	And now...
7546540	7548540	Where did we stop? White Drop.
7548540	7550540	Okay, I told you Tom Hardy.
7550540	7553540	Next movie. Sorry to Bother You. I already told you about it.
7553540	7556540	It's basically...
7556540	7558540	Yeah.
7558540	7560540	You have to watch it.
7560540	7564540	It's a must-see like The Big Short and The Big Crash.
7564540	7566540	It's a little bit funnier.
7566540	7572540	But it has a lot more parts of the snowball system and capitalism than the others.
7572540	7577540	It starts with Call Center and ends with the absolute creation of life.
7577540	7584540	I think I talked about it in my video about mass animal husbandry and the exploitation of life through capitalism.
7584540	7590540	I think that's what I'm talking about because it's exactly in this direction. Human capital and so on.
7590540	7592540	So what else do I have here? The shaft.
7592540	7595540	Well, I made an English video about the shaft.
7595540	7601540	For me, the nice thing about the shaft is that this thing with the Monte Carlo simulation
7601540	7610540	and the markets or, let's say, with the solution, with the spontaneous solidarity, is well represented.
7610540	7614540	You could still discuss whether it's about capitalism or socialism.
7614540	7618540	But that doesn't matter. It's about hierarchies.
7618540	7622540	And of course I would like to say that it's essentially about capitalism.
7622540	7625540	The film is critical of capitalism.
7625540	7627540	But you don't have to...
7628540	7634540	It's basically about hierarchy criticism and how a society is built up in a world
7634540	7637540	in which you can only imagine that there must be hierarchies.
7637540	7642540	And whether you call it capitalism or socialism doesn't matter.
7642540	7645540	I think that's well represented in the film.
7645540	7647540	And of course it has a lot of funny aspects.
7647540	7650540	I made a long English video about it, about 20 minutes or so.
7650540	7655540	If you can stand my English, you can give it to me because it's really disgusting.
7655540	7657540	But I don't want to talk about it anymore.
7657540	7662540	It's completely clear that this is a film that belongs in such a list.
7662540	7663540	The next film.
7663540	7664540	Rampage 2.
7664540	7666540	Capital punishment.
7666540	7668540	I think all Rampage parts are great.
7668540	7671540	They are by Uwe Boll and they are fantastic.
7671540	7673540	The films are really just wonderful.
7673540	7674540	I totally agree.
7674540	7679540	And Rampage 2 is just super awesome because it's really about capitalism
7679540	7683540	and how he wants to really destroy the establishment.
7683540	7684540	And it's just awesome.
7684540	7686540	And I think Uwe Boll also plays himself.
7686540	7690540	Or he plays some other film maker.
7690540	7692540	And it's just ...
7693540	7694540	Ah yes.
7694540	7697540	So of course you can guess Uwe Boll and hate him as you want.
7697540	7699540	But I think this film is really awesome.
7699540	7700540	I'm just on it.
7700540	7702540	The next film.
7702540	7704540	Good bless America.
7704540	7706540	Super awesome film.
7707540	7710540	It's not directly about capitalism or something.
7710540	7712540	But it's about ...
7715540	7720540	... about media and about this fucked up American culture
7720540	7726540	that at the end, after a hundred years, comes out of the people.
7726540	7728540	A lot is being said about it.
7728540	7731540	There is also this fetish that everyone always has to become younger.
7731540	7735540	And that actually all are pedophiles because of their sexual ideals.
7735540	7737540	Everyone wants to fuck a 14-year-old and so on.
7737540	7739540	Everything is shown super well.
7739540	7743540	That this whole cult and this whole beauty ideal is based on it.
7743540	7745540	And ...
7746540	7751540	I think in the end, they are in a talk show or in some evening show
7751540	7752540	and ...
7752540	7754540	... they bang their heads a little bit.
7754540	7756540	That reminds a little bit of the end of Joker.
7757540	7760540	But the film is also made a little funny at the beginning.
7760540	7762540	But it's just ... it's just wonderful.
7762540	7765540	It's for people who are latent,
7765540	7767540	what they have against this capitalist use of logic
7767540	7771540	and this stupid culture of stupidity.
7771540	7772540	It's wonderful.
7772540	7774540	So everyone who likes idiocacy
7774540	7777540	has to see God Bless America.
7778540	7781540	These films are not the same,
7781540	7784540	but I have the impression that they belong together.
7785540	7787540	So God Bless America.
7787540	7789540	Super cool film. I can only recommend it.
7790540	7792540	The next film on the list is known.
7792540	7793540	The Wolf of Wall Street.
7793540	7795540	I don't need to say anything about it.
7795540	7796540	It's a great film.
7797540	7798540	It's just fantastic.
7798540	7799540	Especially the end.
7799540	7802540	The end is really premium.
7802540	7803540	The whole film is premium.
7803540	7804540	Don't get me wrong.
7804540	7805540	The film is super cool.
7805540	7806540	But the end.
7806540	7810540	How he holds these workshops, these lectures
7810540	7811540	with the pen.
7811540	7813540	How do I sell the pen to people and so on.
7813540	7815540	And the camera perspective.
7815540	7818540	How the audience is filmed, so to speak.
7818540	7820540	And how everyone actually goes down on these guys
7820540	7822540	with the success and so on.
7822540	7823540	That's great.
7823540	7825540	The film has several layers of interpretation
7825540	7827540	and they are all fantastic.
7828540	7829540	Super cool film.
7829540	7831540	I don't need to say anything more.
7832540	7833540	Next film.
7834540	7835540	Falling Down.
7835540	7836540	A normal day.
7836540	7839540	Now you ask yourself, what does it have to do with capitalism?
7839540	7841540	The film is only about capitalism.
7842540	7847540	Michael Douglas comes to a few stations of his life
7847540	7848540	in the film.
7848540	7851540	And again and again he asks questions.
7851540	7852540	Why is it like this?
7852540	7853540	Why is it like this?
7853540	7855540	Why is it so shitty here?
7855540	7856540	Why don't you do it like this?
7856540	7858540	And the answer is always capitalism.
7858540	7859540	But he doesn't see it.
7860540	7863540	Because for a while he himself in this cold war
7863540	7866540	in this ideology that the Americans are the best.
7866540	7867540	And that he is a patriot.
7867540	7869540	And that he would do everything for his country and so on.
7869540	7872540	I think he also worked at the CIA as an engineer
7872540	7873540	or something like that.
7873540	7875540	And he sacrificed himself for his country.
7875540	7877540	But no one gives a fuck about it.
7877540	7879540	And in the end it's all a big joke.
7879540	7882540	And of course he also has a huge psychosis.
7882540	7884540	He beats his wife and everything is shit.
7884540	7885540	And he is not understood.
7885540	7888540	He doesn't feel valued.
7890540	7892540	And there is this super cool scene
7892540	7894540	also with the Nazi in this store.
7894540	7896540	Where he says to the Nazi
7896540	7899540	we are not friends and you are not an American.
7899540	7901540	You are just an asshole.
7901540	7905540	And that is a wonderful scene.
7905540	7910540	Because he doesn't see himself that way.
7910540	7913540	He doesn't see that he also behaves racistically.
7913540	7916540	Or even better, that capitalism
7916540	7919540	strengthens these racist tendencies.
7919540	7924540	Whereas he himself is not racist.
7924540	7927540	He also tells this Asian in the store
7927540	7929540	that he is just a fucking faggot
7929540	7931540	and that the coke is so expensive.
7931540	7933540	And so he completely rages.
7933540	7936540	And I don't even know how it was.
7936540	7940540	But of course he throws some racist words at his head.
7940540	7942540	But he just does that because
7942540	7944540	he doesn't want to be in his culture
7944540	7946540	because he is a racist.
7946540	7948540	And the other guy is a real racist.
7948540	7950540	And he also has something against whores.
7950540	7952540	And he sits in his leather shop
7952540	7955540	with the military stuff and the tank fist and so on.
7955540	7957540	And all this nonsense.
7957540	7960540	And then he clearly limits himself.
7960540	7962540	And says, no, wait a minute, that's me.
7962540	7964540	But I'm not. I'm a real American
7964540	7966540	and we are really crazy here.
7966540	7968540	We are the Americans, we don't need that.
7968540	7970540	This whole film actually shows everyone
7970540	7972540	all these contradictions of capitalism
7972540	7974540	and above all this western culture
7974540	7976540	which was highly stylized there.
7976540	7978540	Especially at the time, the film is already 20, 30 years old.
7978540	7980540	It is shown super cool.
7980540	7982540	And above all it is shown
7982540	7984540	why the conservatives and the AFD
7984540	7986540	why they are so to speak strong.
7986540	7988540	Because people like Michael Douglas
7988540	7990540	they don't see the problem.
7990540	7992540	They only see symptoms.
7992540	7994540	And Michael Douglas is not able
7994540	7996540	to do a system analysis.
7996540	7998540	He goes over this golf course,
7998540	8000540	he completely rubs off
8000540	8002540	that these damn yuppie wankers
8002540	8004540	No, they are not yuppies.
8004540	8006540	No, they are some old rich sacks.
8006540	8008540	It doesn't matter. He rubs off completely
8008540	8010540	that this is not a public park.
8010540	8012540	You think, what is this supposed to be?
8012540	8014540	Why is there a fence around here?
8014540	8016540	What kind of wankers are you?
8016540	8018540	This fence should be accessible to the public,
8018540	8020540	this park should be accessible.
8020540	8022540	And you are pissing yourselves off with your golf.
8022540	8024540	This can't be true. Shit.
8024540	8026540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8026540	8028540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8028540	8030540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8030540	8032540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8032540	8034540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8034540	8036540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8036540	8038540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8038540	8040540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8040540	8042540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8042540	8044540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

8050540	8052540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8052540	8054540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

8070540	8072540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8072540	8074540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8074540	8076540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8076540	8078540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8078540	8080540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8080540	8082540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8082540	8084540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8084540	8086540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8086540	8088540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

8164540	8166540	And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.
8166540	8168540	Oh, and by the way,
8168540	8170540	now I remember another movie,
8170540	8172540	which definitely has to be on the list.
8172540	8174540	I, Daniel Blake, also has to be on the list.
8176540	8178540	It's also an awful movie,
8178540	8180540	we'll talk about that in a moment.
8182540	8184540	Yes, and Michael Douglas.
8184540	8186540	Yes, and Michael Douglas.
8186540	8188540	It's just great.
8188540	8190540	First of all, of course, great actor.
8190540	8192540	And he fits in really well.
8192540	8194540	And then the end with his daughter and so on.
8194540	8196540	The bully.
8196540	8198540	The bully who is always behind him.
8198540	8200540	He is one day before the pension.
8200540	8202540	He could just lie back and say
8202540	8204540	fuck it, but no.
8204540	8206540	He is an honest man.
8206540	8208540	And his wife at home
8208540	8210540	only makes him stress and he doesn't want to go home at all.
8210540	8212540	That's why he would rather work.
8212540	8214540	But he only has colleagues who piss him off
8214540	8216540	and who don't follow him.
8216540	8218540	He is the only one who takes his job seriously.
8218540	8220540	And he is a really nice boy.
8220540	8222540	Who just wants the best for everyone.
8222540	8224540	And he gets really pissed off by the system.
8224540	8226540	You notice that too.
8226540	8228540	And that's so funny, because
8228540	8230540	both protagonists, this old cracker,
8230540	8232540	the bully and Michael Douglas,
8232540	8234540	the old cracker
8234540	8236540	could also have a bad day
8236540	8238540	and completely freak out.
8238540	8240540	And he is really just being fucked up
8240540	8242540	on his job and he is also doing great shit.
8242540	8244540	But he has the resilience
8244540	8246540	and this goodwill.
8246540	8248540	And Michael Douglas doesn't have that anymore.
8248540	8250540	This is the dualism
8250540	8252540	of these two people.
8252540	8254540	How they meet at the end and talk about
8254540	8256540	things they can't do.
8256540	8258540	And then of course he beats him up.
8258540	8260540	I think he beats him up at the end.
8260540	8262540	And then the movie is over.
8262540	8264540	And it's all super tragic.
8264540	8266540	The movie is lovely.
8266540	8268540	And in my opinion it's all about
8268540	8270540	capitalism in the movie.
8280540	8282540	So...
8282540	8284540	What are the boys writing here?
8290540	8292540	The question is, how do I recognize
8292540	8294540	a good prof, what is a good topic
8294540	8296540	for the final work. Yes, that is difficult of course.
8296540	8298540	So you should first
8298540	8300540	go after whether the topic
8300540	8302540	sounds interesting to you.
8302540	8304540	Intuitively. Whether you think that is an interesting topic.
8304540	8306540	That is the most important thing.
8306540	8308540	If you, after the pitch meeting,
8308540	8310540	after the first three minutes,
8310540	8312540	think that is an interesting topic.
8312540	8314540	Or that is an important topic
8314540	8316540	for the industry,
8316540	8318540	for the society.
8318540	8320540	Or just an academically interesting topic.
8320540	8322540	One that challenges you mentally.
8322540	8324540	Where you think, oh that is a cool problem.
8324540	8326540	And I can already imagine how to solve that.
8326540	8328540	I am interested in
8328540	8330540	solving that. Because usually
8330540	8332540	it becomes much more difficult in detail
8332540	8334540	and then turns out to be completely different.
8334540	8336540	But that doesn't matter. You then have this motivation
8336540	8338540	to fight through it.
8338540	8340540	That is always the case.
8340540	8342540	That would be a good occasion.
8342540	8344540	That you say, that is a cool topic.
8344540	8346540	I don't know how it works at your university,
8346540	8348540	but typically it was like that.
8348540	8350540	You go to a prof and say, what topics do you have?
8350540	8352540	Then he has a catalog of topics there.
8352540	8354540	And then you look at them.
8354540	8356540	Or you have a friend
8356540	8358540	or you know an engineering company
8358540	8360540	that would do something like that.
8360540	8362540	And then you can go to the prof and say,
8362540	8364540	I have someone here who would do that with me.
8364540	8366540	And then you can build a connection in that direction as well.
8366540	8368540	That is actually all relatively chill at the university.
8370540	8372540	If you find something like that.
8372540	8374540	The worst are the 0815 topics.
8376540	8378540	Like, measure here
8378540	8380540	and write a protocol about it.
8380540	8382540	And that is your job.
8382540	8384540	That is a well-earned note.
8384540	8386540	And that is how they lure people.
8386540	8388540	Well-earned notes. But you learn almost nothing.
8388540	8390540	That is alien.
8390540	8392540	Nobody cares about your results.
8392540	8394540	And sometimes
8394540	8396540	it is like that
8396540	8398540	that these quests are
8398540	8400540	a real dead-end in my opinion.
8400540	8402540	That does not lead to anything.
8402540	8404540	You miss something
8404540	8406540	and then nobody cares
8406540	8408540	and then it is just shit.
8408540	8410540	Much better is that you have a concrete problem
8410540	8412540	and you have to solve it.
8412540	8414540	Let's say you have a machine
8414540	8416540	that has an output
8416540	8418540	and you have another machine
8418540	8420540	and they have to be connected
8420540	8422540	and you have to automate something.
8422540	8424540	You have to optimize a process
8424540	8426540	or you have to understand
8426540	8428540	that the interface works
8428540	8430540	and that the machines can communicate with each other.
8430540	8432540	Something like that.
8432540	8434540	A typical engineer's topic.
8434540	8436540	That is actually cool.
8436540	8438540	And you learn a lot.
8438540	8440540	You learn something for practice.
8440540	8442540	Bus systems,
8442540	8444540	you have other protocols.
8444540	8446540	In general, you learn something about IT.
8446540	8448540	That comes next.
8448540	8450540	That is an engineer
8450540	8452540	who is the most general
8452540	8454540	of those people who are in practice
8454540	8456540	can think outside of the box.
8456540	8458540	I do not want to force you to become a programmer
8458540	8460540	but I want to make it clear
8460540	8462540	that if you have something like that
8462540	8464540	where machines have protocols
8464540	8466540	where you have to think about
8466540	8468540	how that works
8468540	8470540	how signals are processed
8470540	8472540	then you have to think about
8472540	8474540	how the world works.
8474540	8476540	That is much better and that brings a lot more.
8476540	8478540	What is written on your paper
8478540	8480540	that is completely irrelevant
8480540	8482540	because the heart attack is so strong
8482540	8484540	that everyone already knows that.
8484540	8486540	The companies of today see that everywhere.
8486540	8488540	If you can say in a meeting
8488540	8490540	I have clarified this and that
8490540	8492540	because I am crazy and I put it on me
8492540	8494540	and besides, lol
8494540	8496540	then it brings a lot more
8496540	8498540	because you then go in with your
8498540	8500540	inflated young man's breast
8500540	8502540	and say I'm the crazy boy.
8502540	8504540	That is the elegance that you have to have.
8504540	8506540	As a physicist, for example, I always have it.
8508540	8510540	That is the Jedi sword
8510540	8512540	that I got with my diploma
8512540	8514540	that I imagine myself
8514540	8516540	I am so crazy.
8516540	8518540	With such an elegance
8518540	8520540	if you go somewhere like that
8520540	8522540	and say you are the crazy boy
8522540	8524540	of course people can also think
8524540	8526540	what kind of a fucking asshole is that
8526540	8528540	but of course you have to pack it like that
8528540	8530540	that you are just self-confident.
8530540	8532540	That is the most important thing.
8532540	8534540	That's how it is with the wedding show too.
8534540	8536540	If you make it clear to the woman
8536540	8538540	that you are a crazy boy
8538540	8540540	and that you are just self-confident
8540540	8542540	you get the ices.
8542540	8544540	You have to shine it out.
8544540	8546540	And that only works if you really understand
8546540	8548540	and stand behind it.
8548540	8550540	If you stand on a piece of paper
8550540	8552540	that you are a great engineer
8552540	8554540	but you know that what you did there is not worth anything
8554540	8556540	then it is difficult
8556540	8558540	to act authentically.
8558540	8560540	At least that's my impression.
8560540	8562540	At least that's my impression.
8562540	8564540	That people can't do that.
8564540	8566540	The worst are the guys who think they are the best
8566540	8568540	but they can't do anything.
8568540	8570540	Because those are the guys
8570540	8572540	you ask yourself a question.
8572540	8574540	I already had conversations with such people.
8574540	8576540	You ask yourself a very simple question.
8576540	8578540	What does the Fourier transformation
8578540	8580540	of Cosinus look like?
8580540	8582540	And then they can't do that.
8584540	8586540	And I can only laugh at them
8586540	8588540	how ridiculous that is.
8588540	8590540	People like that can go to hell.
8594540	8596540	I stopped doing Mechatronics
8596540	8598540	and then I worked as a car mechanic.
8598540	8600540	I stopped doing Mechatronics
8600540	8602540	and then I worked as a car mechanic.
8602540	8604540	Yes, of course.
8604540	8606540	Why not?
8606540	8608540	It could be.
8608540	8610540	It always depends on the personality.
8610540	8612540	For some it would be better to do it later.
8612540	8614540	For some it is good
8614540	8616540	if they do a few years of training.
8616540	8618540	First training, then studies
8618540	8620540	or going to the club or whatever.
8620540	8622540	That would be a classic thing
8622540	8624540	like what my buddy did.
8624540	8626540	He was in the club for 6, 7 or 8 years.
8626540	8628540	But he didn't want to go to the juice shop anymore.
8628540	8630540	And then he got out
8630540	8632540	of the good job he had.
8632540	8634540	He was safe.
8634540	8636540	He went out and decided for a happy student life
8636540	8638540	with little money.
8638540	8640540	Just because he found it so disgusting.
8642540	8644540	And now he is still in his job
8644540	8646540	and has to do a lot more.
8646540	8648540	He decided to do it
8648540	8650540	just because he found it better.
8650540	8652540	Because it is something that
8652540	8654540	makes him feel closer to himself.
8654540	8656540	Less alienation.
8656540	8658540	But looking back
8658540	8660540	you could
8660540	8662540	start studying again.
8662540	8664540	You just have to find
8664540	8666540	a way to do it in parallel
8666540	8668540	with the university.
8668540	8670540	Or to take an education credit
8670540	8672540	and do it again.
8672540	8674540	I don't know how it is with BAföG.
8674540	8676540	If you are 25 now, you will still get BAföG.
8676540	8678540	I think BAföG goes up to 30.
8678540	8680540	Or does it go up to 25?
8680540	8682540	I don't know.
8682540	8684540	You have to work on it.
8684540	8686540	Why not study now?
8696540	8698540	Unfortunately, Titanic
8698540	8700540	scared me so much. Blood diamond was the first film
8700540	8702540	that I wanted to watch.
8702540	8704540	But that is funny because
8704540	8706540	Leonardo DiCaprio
8706540	8708540	except for Titanic
8708540	8710540	only made good movies.
8710540	8712540	He is also a kind of Robert Pattinson.
8712540	8714540	He was crazy before.
8714540	8716540	He made many good movies before.
8716540	8718540	He has the Streets of New York
8718540	8720540	or something like that.
8720540	8722540	I don't remember his name.
8722540	8724540	He was very young.
8724540	8726540	Then also films like The Beach.
8726540	8728540	Super cool film.
8728540	8730540	DiCaprio made a lot of
8730540	8732540	really good movies.
8732540	8734540	And Titanic was...
8734540	8736540	I grew up with it too.
8736540	8738540	That is the Titanic.
8738540	8740540	What kind of shit movie is that?
8740540	8742540	According to the motto.
8742540	8744540	He makes a love-homo movie.
8744540	8746540	He should fuck with his dick stuff.
8746540	8748540	Sure, that is the mainstream
8748540	8750540	attitude you get.
8750540	8752540	But as soon as you have seen The Beach
8752540	8754540	or James Carroll
8754540	8756540	was his name.
8756540	8758540	Jim Carroll?
8758540	8760540	Streets of New York or something like that?
8760540	8762540	One of the first movies.
8762540	8764540	Only good movies.
8764540	8766540	Leonardo DiCaprio made almost only good movies.
8772540	8774540	Yes, that is good
8774540	8776540	if it is valued on programming
8776540	8778540	and signal processing.
8778540	8780540	Because that is actually
8780540	8782540	an engineer who does not do that.
8782540	8784540	Or who does not develop
8784540	8786540	any interest for development.
8786540	8788540	He is a boomer.
8788540	8790540	He lives on a dying branch.
8790540	8792540	That is clear.
8792540	8794540	Especially because the engineer
8794540	8796540	represents the interface between
8796540	8798540	a real, normal mechanic
8798540	8800540	and an academic physicist.
8800540	8802540	That is someone who has the practical
8802540	8804540	relationship but still understands
8804540	8806540	the theoretical basics.
8806540	8808540	At least as far as he needs it
8808540	8810540	for his problem solving.
8810540	8812540	It is clear that you cannot
8812540	8814540	say that the L2-norm
8814540	8816540	of the function
8816540	8818540	is smaller than infinite.
8818540	8820540	That is not expected from you.
8820540	8822540	You are expected to understand
8822540	8824540	these things with mathematics
8824540	8826540	so far as to correctly
8826540	8828540	classify and solve the problems.
8832540	8834540	By the way, you can write me an email.
8834540	8836540	I like to help people
8836540	8838540	who are in such a situation.
8838540	8840540	Because I know myself quite well.
8840540	8842540	Especially with mathematics.
8844540	8846540	And if someone is a well-paid
8846540	8848540	employee of Antifa GmbH
8848540	8850540	then I already have
8850540	8852540	a kind of house-sympathy.
8854540	8856540	To be honest, I did not know
8856540	8858540	what an in-study
8858540	8860540	should bring me.
8860540	8862540	Well, if you say
8862540	8864540	what did you do?
8864540	8866540	You worked at a car dealer.
8866540	8868540	That means you have a lot of practice.
8868540	8870540	Practice, I assume.
8870540	8872540	The nice thing about
8872540	8874540	an academic career is
8874540	8876540	the academic
8876540	8878540	elegance that comes with it.
8878540	8880540	And I do not mean
8880540	8882540	that an elitist pisser
8882540	8884540	comes out of it
8884540	8886540	and raises you
8886540	8888540	to another level.
8888540	8890540	Because you see
8890540	8892540	certain things
8892540	8894540	from a different perspective.
8894540	8896540	You cannot underestimate
8896540	8898540	what that brings.
8898540	8900540	It brings a lot.
8900540	8902540	Studying, if you do it
8902540	8904540	because you feel like it.
8904540	8906540	I am not talking about all those
8906540	8908540	weirdos who make inflation
8908540	8910540	and just want a piece of paper
8910540	8912540	so that they are hired at a bank
8912540	8914540	or get a boss position in a
8914540	8916540	bureaucratic office.
8916540	8918540	I am talking about
8918540	8920540	people who are interested in content.
8920540	8922540	And if you say you worked at a car dealer
8922540	8924540	then I assume you have
8924540	8926540	a lot of experience.
8926540	8928540	You know the numbers.
8928540	8930540	You know the mechanics.
8930540	8932540	But first of all
8932540	8934540	I would say that the car
8934540	8936540	with the combustion engine
8936540	8938540	is a story
8938540	8940540	that is on the dying branch.
8940540	8942540	But on the other hand
8942540	8944540	there is much more to discover.
8944540	8946540	The engineering studio is
8946540	8948540	a window into a different world.
8948540	8950540	You have this application
8950540	8952540	in your head.
8952540	8954540	That is mostly the case.
8954540	8956540	As an engineer you want
8956540	8958540	to install a milling machine
8958540	8960540	or you want to become a sports technician
8960540	8962540	and build fitness equipment.
8962540	8964540	It does not matter.
8964540	8966540	You have an idea of what you want to do.
8966540	8968540	And that is not a problem.
8968540	8970540	The nice thing is that
8970540	8972540	through the academic input
8972540	8974540	that you get
8974540	8976540	I would say
8976540	8978540	you see
8978540	8980540	how it is with modular thinking
8980540	8982540	and abstract thinking.
8982540	8984540	That is
8984540	8986540	an awesome intellectual
8986540	8988540	level up.
8988540	8990540	And nobody can steal it from you.
8990540	8992540	That is super powerful.
8992540	8994540	You feel much better afterwards.
8994540	8996540	It is just
8996540	8998540	I do not get it wrong.
8998540	9000540	I want the activity
9000540	9002540	of normal people
9002540	9004540	who did not go to university
9004540	9006540	and did something right.
9006540	9008540	I do not want to talk about that.
9008540	9010540	As a physicist
9010540	9012540	I did computer-oriented
9012540	9014540	theoretical physics
9014540	9016540	in my graduate school.
9016540	9018540	I am far away from the practice.
9018540	9020540	But I still see that
9020540	9022540	in engineers.
9022540	9024540	I know engineers
9024540	9026540	who are teaching
9026540	9028540	or doing engineering activities
9028540	9030540	and they are crying
9030540	9032540	how terrible it is
9032540	9034540	to deal with students
9034540	9036540	who are only affected by inflation
9036540	9038540	and so on.
9038540	9040540	If you want
9040540	9042540	to do something like that
9042540	9044540	then do it.
9044540	9046540	If you do not want to do it
9046540	9048540	then do it.
9048540	9050540	If you are interested
9050540	9052540	in the content
9052540	9054540	and you learn a lot
9054540	9056540	even in the inflation
9056540	9058540	you can learn a lot.
9058540	9060540	It is not used anymore.
9060540	9062540	You have to do
9062540	9064540	30-25%
9064540	9066540	of the content.
9066540	9068540	But you can do 80%.
9068540	9070540	Nobody can forbid that.
9070540	9072540	And nobody can forbid
9072540	9074540	you to do
9074540	9076540	secondary literature
9076540	9078540	if you are interested.
9078540	9080540	Maybe not statistical physics
9080540	9082540	but only theoretical mechanics.
9088540	9090540	It is a nice excursion
9090540	9092540	if you have the luxury
9092540	9094540	to do something like that.
9094540	9096540	I can only recommend it to everyone.
9096540	9098540	I think it is a real enrichment.
9098540	9100540	It really helps
9100540	9102540	to create something.
9102540	9104540	You can find my e-mail address
9104540	9106540	on the channel.
9106540	9108540	In the YouTube interface.
9108540	9110540	Channel info.
9114540	9116540	I am going to get a beer
9116540	9118540	and turn on the music.
9118540	9120540	We said
9120540	9122540	hard and relaxed.
9122540	9124540	Hard and relaxed.
9124540	9126540	Hard and relaxed.
9126540	9128540	I am thinking about
9128540	9130540	what would be good.
9130540	9132540	Let me think.
9136540	9138540	Hard and relaxed.
9140540	9142540	No.
9142540	9144540	Maybe.
9146540	9148540	I have a good idea.
9148540	9150540	Hard and relaxed.
9168540	9170540	See you soon.
9178540	9180540	Thank you.
9208540	9210540	Thank you.
9238540	9240540	Thank you.
9268540	9270540	Thank you.
9298540	9300540	Thank you.
9328540	9330540	Thank you.
9358540	9360540	Thank you.
