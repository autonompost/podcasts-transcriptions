00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:15,140
and then I'm going to add a little bit of salt and pepper, and then I'm going to add a little bit of salt and pepper, and then I can already hear the music...

75
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,540
We're going to turn off the song, sleepy, and then we're off...

76
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,540
You know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,540
you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:39,540
you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what, you know what,

79
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,540
you know what, you know what, you know what.

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,540
You know what, you know what, you know what.

81
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:31,540
So, I'll explain it to you. I sat at the computer earlier, played a bit, the girls were out

82
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,540
and the woman called and said, should I buy you beer? We are just shopping. I'll bring you

83
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:42,540
beer. Tell me which beer. And it turned out that we were grilling. So I thought, cool,

84
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,540
we're grilling. But that means I'm drinking beer and that means I won't play after that

85
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,540
because if I'm drunk or just drunk, I can't play anymore. I'm taking it seriously.

86
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,540
I have a delay, then I can't react anymore and that's why I can't do it. So I thought,

87
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,540
I'll look at the debate battle at the competition anyway and I'll drink a beer anyway

88
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,540
because we're grilling. And I did this on the beamer in the living room. That means my wife

89
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,540
pulled it in and so on. Super funny. And then I thought, fuck it, do a live stream.

90
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,540
And I always wanted to do something quick anyway, like a few capitalism films

91
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,540
that are running under the radar that no one knows. First thing, in the video description

92
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,540
you have to find a link to a movie pilot list. If you can't see it, then you have to

93
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,540
make a fun account. Make yourself a fun account or log in with some junk,

94
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,540
with some social media. It should work. Then you can see the list. And I just

95
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,540
clicked them together. That means I will certainly have forgotten films that are super nice.

96
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,540
And if you can think of good films that talk about capitalism, and it's not especially

97
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,540
films like The Big Short that are obvious or Wolf of Wall Street, where that is completely clear,

98
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,540
but films where it may not be completely clear that they talk about capitalism.

99
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,540
These films are especially interesting. And yes, I have now prepared the list

100
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,540
and we'll just go through it. And as I said, if you come up with something, just write it

101
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:16,540
in the comments. The chat is now there. So, and before it starts, terms like capitalism

102
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,540
are bubbles on a string. The string is the well-known red thread. Such definitions

103
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:32,540
I see. You're in a good mood today. You have a beer, you have a spade, and that's why

104
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,540
you're making really clever speeches here. I notice that. Okay, no problem. I'll start.

105
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,540
I think I've talked about Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt before. The film is really

106
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,540
wonderful, because the film is actually the perfect thing, in my opinion, about the films

107
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,540
that I actually want to talk about here. The film was sold back then as a mafia film.

108
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,540
He also only had the actors, for example the guys from the Sopranos. He had these typical

109
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,540
mobster mafia situations. And so was the trailer and so was the poster. So the film was

110
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,540
marketed. And everyone went into the movies and then expected a mafia film. And it was

111
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,540
not a classic mafia film. Everyone was already pissed off and the film also got super

112
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,540
bad reviews because everyone was just disappointed. And I'll tell you, I didn't know

113
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,540
the film and I didn't notice the advertising back then. I only saw it a few months ago.

114
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,540
And I was totally surprised. First of all, the film is also produced by Wood Pitt and

115
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:38,540
the film is about capitalism. So this setting, this mafia setting that is

116
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,540
embodied there, that's just a make-up artist. That's just a marketing strategy for the

117
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,540
film. But on the other hand, it's an extremely good metaphor. It's about capitalism.

118
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,540
And the nice thing is, Brad Pitt himself plays the main role and he embodies capitalism.

119
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,540
He embodies, in my opinion, all contradictions of capitalism. He has them in him.

120
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,540
So first of all, it's of course Brad Pitt. He looks super cool, he runs around, he's super

121
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,540
clean, he talks all the time and so on. And he just does it as if he were really serious.

122
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,540
And he just wants to, so he's an order killer and he just does his business with killing.

123
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,540
And that's not a problem at all. Morality doesn't play a role in the film at all.

124
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,540
That's really cool. That's what it's about, not at all. But he is constantly

125
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,540
confronted with the fact that his business also leads to things that

126
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,540
piss him off. And that's just funny. And the film is really just elegant and

127
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,540
very nicely done. Especially the first scenes are really dirty and you can see

128
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:47,540
how it is when you stand in the bottom of the pyramid in the USA. There is no solidarity.

129
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Natural Born Chaos, yes. Very good idea. I'll add it right away.

130
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,540
If my wife was in the chat now, she would have said that a long time ago.

131
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,540
This is my wife's favorite film. In any case, a really good film because he

132
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,540
refers really well to how it is with the media and with the feedback loops.

133
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,540
And above all, he is already so old and yet the film is still completely accurate.

134
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,540
So, Killings in Softly. And that's for example the guy from the Sopranos.

135
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,540
He plays an aging order killer and he should do the job. And he should do the job

136
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,540
only because he wants to kill someone because Brad Pitt doesn't want to do it himself.

137
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,540
He somehow knows the victim so half and he actually didn't want to be pulled in

138
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,540
and that's just too emotional. And he would rather do an alienated business where

139
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,540
he is far away from the content. He doesn't want to argue about content. He just wants

140
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,540
to make a business decision. And then he gets a Sopranos man and he is

141
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,540
already completely over the mountain. So he doesn't want to do his job anymore.

142
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,540
He doesn't want to do anything anymore. He is completely alienated from the world.

143
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,540
He actually just wants to use alcohol. And that is no longer fun for him.

144
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,540
And he meets him in a hotel lobby and he is already badly reprimanded because the guy is

145
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,540
so fat and old and shit and he doesn't want to do it anymore and he is just drunk.

146
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,540
And Brad Pitt tries to get him to do the job and in the end he doesn't do it.

147
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,540
And then Brad Pitt has to do it himself and all that. And that's all totally awesome.

148
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Super nice. And the best thing about the film. So first of all, this whole mess,

149
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,540
how it gets there. The actors are great. The whole excessive violence that is

150
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,540
shown in the film. It is really not fetishizing at all.

151
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,540
It is not like you would expect in a normal gangster movie.

152
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Really masculine, really cool scenes where someone shoots you in the head with a

153
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,540
gun or something. Or where someone beats you up really hard. Yes, there is that.

154
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,540
But they are shown the way they are. Just raw and bloody.

155
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,540
I am actually used to raw violence in films and bloody films.

156
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Nevertheless, I had this feeling when watching the film that this is just not an

157
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,540
aesthetic scene. It is just disgusting. It just resists you because the violence is

158
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,540
shown so realistically. And you really think, oh, does that have to be now?

159
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,540
Do they have to do that now? That's shit. And so on and so on.

160
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,540
And believe me, I have already seen a lot of films. It is not that I am

161
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,540
somehow surrounded by violence and that is why I am not good at it.

162
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,540
And that is wonderful. And of course all the actors are great.

163
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,540
And also all the little characters that are in it.

164
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,540
In my opinion, this is also a metaphor for the hype on the market place.

165
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,540
There are many small actors and that doesn't matter at all.

166
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,540
They will be irrelevant at some point. All the stories of the actors don't matter at some point.

167
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,540
At some point it's just about Brad Pitt and his business and whether he ends the quest

168
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,540
properly or not. And at the end of the film, that is really the best, the end,

169
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,540
the last 2-3 minutes, he is sitting there with the guy with whom he shot the deal

170
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,540
and so on. He was supposed to finish the job.

171
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,540
And somehow he gets less money. He gets beaten up for the money.

172
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,540
And in the background, Obama is running because there is a election campaign.

173
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,540
We are a big nation, we are a community, we all belong together. Come together, people.

174
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,540
And Brad Pitt doesn't have to come out at all and laugh how ridiculous that is.

175
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,540
Because he says, no, wait a minute, the USA is not a country. We are not a community.

176
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,540
Everyone has his own business. And besides, where is my money, you asshole?

177
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,540
And it's just a wonderful situation. I've said that before. The film is really fantastic.

178
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,540
And I think such films are great. He made fun of the people who watch the film,

179
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,540
as it is part of marketing, i.e. with capitalist methods,

180
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,540
to go to the cinema and watch the film about capitalism.

181
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Of course, everyone was pissed off afterwards. I think it's wonderful. I can really imagine

182
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,540
And yes, all these metaphors in the film.

183
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,540
Then these drug addicts at the beginning, the mafia boys with the money and so on.

184
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,540
And then in the end the wrong one is knocked out. And that's just great.

185
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,540
It's a great film. So, next film.

186
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,540
The next film on my list. In German it's called The Black Diamond.

187
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,540
I don't know, I didn't even know that it's called that.

188
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,540
I think I looked it up in German. It's called Uncut Gems in English.

189
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,540
So, unpolished diamonds, one might translate that.

190
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,540
The film is first of all great because it's with Adam Sandler.

191
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,540
And Adam Sandler, you know, that's the guy who always makes these nonsense films.

192
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,540
These normal mainstream comedies, nonsense films.

193
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,540
And in this film, which is a highly serious film, he plays a guy

194
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,540
in the diamond Jewish quarter, where all the other diamond Jews are sitting around

195
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,540
in their weird diamond boots and peeing at each other with the stones and so on.

196
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,540
And I think the film starts with an African from a mine knocking out a fat clunker.

197
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,540
That's how the film starts. So that you can briefly see the misery,

198
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,540
from which misery layer everything is made. And then it's just about how

199
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Adam Sandler tries to tick this fat clunker. And the whole film turns around like this.

200
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,540
And Adam Sandler is just a wheel in the gear. It becomes completely clear in the film

201
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,540
that he is of course not a profiteur of the system. Even if he sells the stone and everything is clean.

202
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,540
He is a profiteur. He has an infinite amount of stress in the film. It makes him completely finished.

203
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,540
He also probably has debts somewhere else. And it's all semi-legal.

204
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Then he has some mafia boys who want to finish him. And he has this diamond shop

205
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,540
and that's so cool. And then he somehow has a wife, then he has an affair and so on.

206
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,540
Then it all goes down the drain. He is always stressed. His phone is constantly ringing.

207
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,540
And the whole setting is so that you as a viewer are permanently really tense.

208
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,540
You really feel the burnout. You feel the burnout of Adam Sandler.

209
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,540
And Adam Sandler in the film is also shown so cool. Because he is already so old.

210
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,540
You can do that really well. He already looks so finished.

211
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,540
And then you have the camera perspectives and close-ups of the faces.

212
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,540
Really intense shots where people are just shown in their ugliness.

213
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,540
That's great. And that's what makes the film so a little bit for me.

214
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,540
This ruckus camera, this stress, the burnout. All that just to somehow earn money.

215
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,540
What the people actually do, at least he, he is also half a player.

216
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,540
He does sports betting and so on. He is of course completely alienated.

217
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,540
What he actually wants is somehow money so that he can buy something with his money.

218
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,540
That's actually the tenor.

219
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,540
The film just completely rots out. It escalates in a certain direction.

220
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,540
And everything is always about this stone.

221
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,540
I would go so far and say this is a typical, this is a real masterpiece.

222
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,540
It's like Killing Them Softly in my opinion. A real masterpiece in terms of a capitalism film.

223
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,540
It's not like The Big Short or other films like Wall Street.

224
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,540
Where it is clear that this is completely clear that this is about capitalism and how stupid it is now.

225
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,540
I think clear films like that are also great. They are just on the list here because they are part of it.

226
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,540
But Uncut Gems is a film that is really really premium.

227
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,540
And I can only recommend it to you if you don't know it.

228
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,540
I have the impression that such films, although they are with such fat actors, do not come into the mainstream.

229
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,540
Because they just treat serious topics and the audience does not want that.

230
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Because of casualization. There are only Avengers and some strange family films.

231
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,540
They are in the mainstream because they create positive vibes.

232
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,540
And that is exactly what people need in times of crisis.

233
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,540
People watch so many films that they break down.

234
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,540
And if you don't have the mental capacity and you just look at something like that all the time, then you go crazy.

235
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Just because you are not aware of your own empathy.

236
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,540
I have the feeling that there must not be a perfect political system.

237
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,540
Because all political currents live from friction and crumbling.

238
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:51,540
If you think with a perfect political system that it is a system where the debates do not exist.

239
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Or where everyone is always in agreement, where there are no conflicts.

240
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,540
I could imagine that it is a bit like the perfect free market.

241
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Where all information is there and all actors make perfect rational decisions.

242
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Then there is no profit in the system anymore.

243
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,540
I have looked up this article from Investopedia.

244
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,540
The perfect free market, the perfect competition, does not generate any profit anymore.

245
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,540
And maybe that's what you mean, the perfect political system.

246
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,540
As long as it contains people, I don't think it exists.

247
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,540
The inherent human contradictions reflect in our society again.

248
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,540
On a higher level we get them all turned in again.

249
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,540
And be it prejudices and racism, that's enough.

250
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,540
But of course there are many other things that play into it.

251
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,540
That's why I say, because the problem is that there is no perfect political system.

252
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,540
The optimal solution would be the absolute crumbling of all hierarchies.

253
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Maybe not maximum, but extremely strong decentralization.

254
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:22,540
It could be that there are groups of 50 people who can establish themselves in a kind of debate culture that can function stably.

255
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Because even if one of them goes out with the neighbor's wife and the other husband is angry, they might not give up.

256
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Then you can somehow solve it.

257
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:45,540
This is also observed in many Swedish films, where people realize that such problems are not so strong if there is enough mental capacity in people.

258
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,540
All these inter-men problems that may also shake up.

259
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:55,540
If you have hierarchies, if one is the boss of a big company and has hatred for someone,

260
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:02,540
that he tries to use his power, which he exposes only to destroy someone who has only slept with his wife,

261
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,540
which has nothing to do with the business or the power itself and should actually be irrelevant to the hierarchies.

262
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:15,540
But that will be done by the fact that our human flaws are transferred to it.

263
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Such a thing would also be possible.

264
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,540
But such a thing is small because of decentralization, because one does not give so much power to individual people.

265
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Then one would automatically solve it.

266
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Yes, people are not perfect, so no systems, I would say.

267
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Yes, that is definitely the case.

268
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:40,540
You can really compare it with stable systems.

269
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:47,540
In physics, one talks about stable systems when small deviations do not change the state of balance.

270
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,540
A classic example is cycling.

271
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Cycling only works because of rotation.

272
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:01,540
Rotation creates, so to speak, the wheels turn, they have a rotation and that is a constant with respect to the fixed star.

273
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,540
Of course, friction takes a little bit away, but that means that when you drive and there is a small deviation,

274
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,540
for example, I steer a little bit like this or I wobble around a bit, then I roll and then I keep tilting back,

275
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,540
then I tilt back, because that is also the case with a circle, in the state of balance.

276
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,540
Against small deviations, it is stable.

277
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,540
If, of course, one of the sides gives you a drop, then you fall off the bike and then the wheel turns, of course.

278
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
But for small deviations it is good.

279
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,540
So, and now you have to ask yourself systematically, how do you get the small deviations?

280
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,540
Well, if you do not start a world war, but only once the neighbor's wife has birded, then it is a small deviation.

281
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
But that can not make a world war easier.

282
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,540
If you now bird the wife of Putin, then maybe.

283
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
But the problem is, only Putin is so powerful.

284
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:52,540
So if you have small decentralized organs, where, so to speak, the power cannot be organized in big hierarchies,

285
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,540
then you can only generate small deviations with these human errors,

286
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:02,540
which then, possibly, by the community, which then knows and acts relatively familiarly,

287
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,540
because everyone is connected with everyone, not so alienated and anonymous as now, for example, here,

288
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,540
in a big city, in a normal big city, where you do not even know your neighbors,

289
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
then something like that works.

290
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:19,540
And if you have small hierarchies, with small communities, where everything is somehow debatable,

291
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540
then it is somehow more conceivable.

292
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,540
And then, so to speak, the question is, how do you solve this with the big problems?

293
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Well, with real networking and transparency.

294
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,540
So you have to strive for a transparent global networking,

295
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,540
in which something similar like a democracy can be nurtured with debate culture.

296
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
But that is definitely future music.

297
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,540
The basic requirement would be that you have enough mature citizens.

298
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,540
So not like now, but really many.

299
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,540
Over 50% should already be people who, so to speak, come to terms with it

300
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,540
and at least recognize how the world works.

301
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,540
Social engineering.

302
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Digitalized humanity.

303
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,540
The thing is, I'm doing this video series about digitalization now,

304
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:30,540
and I don't know what's next, but I'm going to make a video about blockchain at some point.

305
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:36,540
Because blockchain, so to speak, is an academic aspect,

306
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,540
although very academic, but a relatively positive aspect.

307
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,540
And I think that these things bring all these positive vibes because of what digitalization could do.

308
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,540
It could, for example, pick up all the monopolistic structures.

309
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Because that is exactly what automated, decentralized trust creates, a transparent environment.

310
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Of course, it has many disadvantages, for example, energy consumption.

311
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,540
But the idea is not bad at first, and you can definitely do a lot of things from it.

312
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,540
The thing is, I'm just drawing up a lecture on cryptography,

313
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,540
just because I never really managed to draw it up,

314
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,540
because of how it works in real life, for example with random generators.

315
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,540
I once had a lecture on algorithms in physics or something.

316
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,540
It was mainly about C-programming of such numerical problems.

317
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
But something like that was also addressed.

318
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,540
The thing is, when the random generator was made with us,

319
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
there are different qualities of random generators.

320
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
In essence, they all repeat themselves at some point.

321
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,540
That means you have to sort out the system somehow.

322
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,540
I missed that. I don't know, I was on vacation or something when the lecture was on.

323
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,540
That means, because I didn't understand it in detail,

324
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
I'm drawing up a lecture on cryptography now,

325
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,540
and then I want to draw up a lecture on, I don't know, higher data structures,

326
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,540
to really understand how that works.

327
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Of course, I understand schematically how that works with the blockchain.

328
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,540
That's clear. But that's not enough for me.

329
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,540
I want the details so that I know what I'm talking about.

330
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,540
That's always the way it is.

331
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,540
I want to establish this habitus.

332
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Of course, that takes time, but I have the time.

333
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,540
I have the privilege to draw it up.

334
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,540
I like to draw up 13 lectures, 90 minutes each.

335
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Just one every day or something.

336
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,540
At some point I got it. At some point I understood it.

337
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,540
That will definitely come, but I don't know when yet.

338
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,540
But this digitalization series is going to be quite lengthy.

339
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,540
I guess 5, 6, 7, 8 videos will already be published.

340
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,540
But I'm also doing other things on the side, so I don't know exactly when.

341
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,540
Then let's look further into my list.

342
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,540
So, apart from Uncut Gems,

343
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,540
the next film I've seen is the film Good Time.

344
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,540
It's by the same filmmaker.

345
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
It's the film before that.

346
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,540
It's also pretty cool.

347
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,540
It has the same thing with the camera and these ugly people in the close-up.

348
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:13,540
But the story is a bit more brutal.

349
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:22,540
Uncut Gems has shown the snowball system on the level of the people we would call privileged.

350
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:29,540
People who have enough income to have a house, an affair, a sports car and so on.

351
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,540
And Good Time shows the difference in the USA.

352
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:41,540
People who are so poor that they don't know where to get their food next week.

353
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:51,540
The film is pretty cool because it starts with a guy in a psychological treatment.

354
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Psychotherapy or something like that.

355
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
He's talking to someone.

356
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,540
He obviously has a tube test and so on.

357
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,540
And the guy is a bit stupid, you can already see that.

358
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,540
He just looks like that and gives some weird answers.

359
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,540
And suddenly the stupid vampire guy, Robert Pattinson, comes in.

360
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,540
He looks really bad in the film, that's great.

361
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,540
And he says, fuck off you fucking therapist, I'll take my brother with me.

362
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,540
I'll save him from this misery.

363
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
I'll take him with me.

364
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,540
And that's how the film starts.

365
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:29,540
And it turns out that Robert Pattinson, by the way, only makes cool films since he stopped this joke with the vampire.

366
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,540
He made a name for himself with the vampire and now he makes cool films.

367
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,540
And that's the best I've seen so far.

368
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,540
But I've seen a few others that aren't bad either.

369
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,540
And he's the big brother of this guy who's a bit mental.

370
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,540
He's a bit stupid.

371
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,540
And they're both poor pigs.

372
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
And what's his plan?

373
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Well, his plan is that he'll transfer a bank with his brother and then he'll fly to Mexico.

374
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
That's the plan.

375
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
And what do they do?

376
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,540
They somehow have scars and they have masks.

377
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
And they dress up as black.

378
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:09,540
That's funny because it's a bit like the structural racism in the states.

379
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Later he's in a prison cell where only black people are sitting around.

380
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
That's funny anyway.

381
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,540
So they transfer a bank.

382
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Then they run away with the money.

383
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,540
Then everything goes wrong.

384
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
I think they lose themselves somehow.

385
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
How was that?

386
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,540
I think the brother, because he's a bit stupid, gets caught by the bulls.

387
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Robert Pattinson escapes with the money.

388
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,540
And then, I think, he has to wash the money.

389
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,540
And he has a lot of problems.

390
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:43,540
The funny thing is, Robert Pattinson is the only character in the whole movie who's clever.

391
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
You notice that.

392
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:50,540
He has problems, thinks of something and finds a relatively good solution.

393
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,540
He has the same burnout mentality as Adam Sandler in the other movie.

394
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Or you can compare it with Jack Bauer in 24.

395
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,540
24 starts, then a problem pops up.

396
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Then three more problems pop up.

397
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,540
At some point he has 1,000 tabs open with 1,000 problems.

398
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,540
And he has to solve them all within 24 hours.

399
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
That's the way it is.

400
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,540
And there are unpredictable things for Robert Pattinson.

401
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
And he gets them somehow.

402
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
He tricks people.

403
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
He just talks them to death.

404
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
So he has found a method.

405
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
The people are so stupid.

406
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
He just needs to talk to them, talk to them, talk to them.

407
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
So really stupid from the side.

408
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Until they just give up and say, yes, you're right or something.

409
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
And you notice that.

410
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
And the kind of dialogues that are introduced in the movie.

411
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:38,540
That's how I actually imagine the normal, uneducated difference in the United States.

412
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,540
They really only talk about such idiotic things.

413
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,540
By the way, Idiocacy is actually a great movie, too.

414
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
It definitely has to be included here.

415
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,540
And yes, that's definitely the case with the film.

416
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,540
You notice that right away.

417
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,540
And you think all the time, that can't be.

418
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,540
The actions sometimes seem so strange to you.

419
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,540
But that's just because you're completely different.

420
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,540
The situation is evaluated as the people who are represented there.

421
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,540
And to get back to the thing with the racism.

422
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
It's super funny.

423
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,540
They're in a amusement park in the meantime.

424
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
I think they want to somehow.

425
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
What do they actually want?

426
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,540
I think either they want to hide the coal or they want to get the coal.

427
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
I don't know anymore.

428
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
In any case, they break in there.

429
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
And then there are security guys.

430
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
And they have to box them over.

431
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
And he's black.

432
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,540
And then they steal the clothes and dress themselves as security boys.

433
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,540
And then the real bulls come later.

434
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,540
And they just clearly assume that the black one has to be the criminal.

435
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
And that's not being spoken out.

436
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
It's like killing in the soft.

437
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
It's not being spoken out.

438
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
It's just a cool situation.

439
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,540
And you think that's an interesting situation.

440
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,540
And you think that's an interesting situation.

441
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
Something like that is being watched out for.

442
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,540
Because of course capitalism and inequality and structural exploitation hierarchies,

443
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,540
such as racism or patriarchy or things like that,

444
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:21,540
they plant themselves very well in almost feudal structures

445
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,540
that we have in capitalism.

446
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,540
And that goes very well with our tradition and where the money is and the snowball system and so on.

447
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:34,540
And another cool situation is, I think in the film it was like this.

448
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,540
He wants to get his brother out of the hospital.

449
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,540
And he's being watched out for bulls.

450
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,540
Then he has to trick the bulls to get his brother out.

451
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,540
But then he finds out that he's on the wrong bed.

452
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Because his brother was completely crushed by the blacks in the jail.

453
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,540
And he has a face that is completely covered with bandages.

454
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,540
And he doesn't know what he looks like.

455
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,540
And then he seems to be standing in front of the wrong bed

456
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
from another guy who was also completely crushed.

457
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,540
He takes him out, throws him in his car,

458
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
and then finds out that he's the wrong guy.

459
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
With him he runs around.

460
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
And the guy tells a story.

461
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,540
He tells a story about how it happened

462
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,540
that he is being watched out for bulls again and has to go to jail again and so on.

463
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
And then it's probably like this.

464
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,540
He came out of the jail and of course has no perspective.

465
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Because you have to imagine, if you were in jail in the states,

466
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
then you're done for.

467
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Then you can hardly get back into society.

468
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
First of all, you're burned.

469
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,540
But on the other hand, you don't have any credibility.

470
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
You don't have any credit worth.

471
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,540
You don't get an apartment and things like that.

472
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,540
Of course, you don't get a job if you don't have an apartment.

473
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
It all comes down to that.

474
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,540
So when you're poor, it gets more and more difficult in the USA.

475
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,540
Because there are very few solidarity structures at all

476
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
to catch these people.

477
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,540
And of course, they slip even further.

478
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Either they become criminals again

479
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,540
or they rot or they are homeless

480
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,540
and then they become criminals again.

481
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,540
With little things and so on.

482
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
But that is shown in the film cool.

483
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,540
And the joke is, Robert Pattinson is freeing him now.

484
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,540
Unintentionally from the hospital.

485
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,540
And the guy wakes up and notices that

486
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,540
and says, shit, now I'm fucked.

487
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,540
I can't, I'm as good as in prison.

488
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
I'm out on bail.

489
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
And that you got me out of here, I can't tell anyone.

490
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I'm fucked.

491
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
I can do whatever I want.

492
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
So that's his logical conclusion.

493
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,540
And that's why they go to this park.

494
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,540
I have a drug hiding place in the park.

495
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,540
With a bunch of drugs.

496
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,540
We can tick them, then we're rich.

497
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
And then we go to Mexico.

498
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
That was the logic.

499
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,540
And he helps him to find the treasure.

500
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,540
And that's a super funny quest.

501
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,540
The whole film goes like this.

502
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
And it's also from the stress level.

503
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Just like Uncut Gems.

504
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,540
That you're always under stress.

505
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,540
And the film ends with Robert Pattinson.

506
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,540
How he gets arrested.

507
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
And sits in a police car.

508
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
And he looks into the camera for a minute.

509
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
And there's no music anymore.

510
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
He just looks.

511
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,540
And as a viewer you let everything go.

512
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
What happened in the last few minutes.

513
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
In the last hour of the film.

514
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
What he just experienced.

515
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
What he tried to solve.

516
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
What problems he solved.

517
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,540
And how he collapses in the end.

518
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
And how unresolvable it is for him.

519
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
It seems to him that he can't get out of this.

520
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
It's possible for him.

521
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
This perspective.

522
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
It's portrayed really well in the film.

523
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
And that's why I think it's a great film about capitalism.

524
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Because that's how it looks.

525
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
Especially for the people who are in these situations.

526
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Who are depicted there.

527
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
In my opinion absolutely realistic films.

528
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Which are also portrayed so well.

529
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
In between there is also this story.

530
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,540
That a 15 year old is seduced.

531
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Just to stay longer in the apartment.

532
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
There is also a lot of borderline stuff.

533
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
And it's all so dirty and dirty.

534
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
And so shit is depicted.

535
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
But just as it is.

536
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
I think that's important.

537
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
Films that just

538
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,540
The disgusting sides.

539
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Of our civilization.

540
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
To the viewer in the face.

541
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,540
And say look at this.

542
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Look at this shit again.

543
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,540
It's so similar.

544
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,540
I really like this film.

545
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,540
This french film.

546
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,540
Cuties.

547
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
Or so.

548
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
It's called Cuties in english.

549
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,540
I think it's only available in english or french.

550
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,540
But you could also use subtitles.

551
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Maybe it's also available in german in the meantime.

552
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,540
It was a scandal film.

553
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Because minor girls 12 or 13.

554
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,540
Or how old they were.

555
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
It doesn't matter.

556
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
They twerk and make music video hip-hop.

557
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,540
And do as if they were the biggest whores in the world.

558
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
And it's depicted in the film.

559
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
And especially the social structures are depicted.

560
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
How it is there.

561
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,540
When you live in a banlieue.

562
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,540
And how it is with this whole hip-hop culture.

563
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Which is absolutely

564
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Downright on this

565
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,540
Muslim tradition world.

566
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
From which most girls come.

567
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
And especially

568
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
This mother and so.

569
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,540
And these family structures, this hierarchy.

570
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
That the men can do what they want.

571
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
He gets himself a new wife.

572
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,540
That's all super interesting.

573
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,540
And the film was

574
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,540
That's why it was a scandal.

575
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Because it's depicted

576
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
That the girls dance like in porn.

577
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
But first I have to say

578
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
The film is made in such a way

579
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
That it's not fetishizing.

580
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,540
It's not depicted as erotic.

581
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
But it's depicted

582
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Like other little girls see it.

583
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
It's always seen

584
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
From the eyes.

585
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
From the eyes of viewers.

586
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,540
That are in the film.

587
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,540
For example little girls.

588
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
Or some erotic pedos

589
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,540
That sit in the audience and turn it with their smartphone.

590
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,540
That's

591
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,540
In my opinion

592
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,540
Not because of this taste.

593
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
But because it's a dangerous film.

594
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,540
Because it suggests something wrong.

595
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,540
I think it suggests the right thing.

596
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,540
And it generates this outrage.

597
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,540
Which had to be clear to everyone.

598
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,540
In my opinion for 20 years.

599
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
Since I was 14, 15.

600
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,540
And it will be given before.

601
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,540
It will be more and more because of casualization and scandalization.

602
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,540
The sexualization of the youth

603
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Is a business model.

604
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,540
It was already there at TAF.

605
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,540
There was always

606
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,540
At least once a title to see.

607
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,540
Then the titles became younger and younger.

608
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
At some point they had

609
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,540
The final class.

610
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,540
Or summer girl 2010.

611
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,540
Or something like that.

612
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,540
Even before Germany's Next Topmodel.

613
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
The youngest of the youngest.

614
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
The youngest who can still be seen on TV.

615
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Sexualized.

616
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,540
For the quota.

617
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,540
In mainstream.

618
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,540
And of course

619
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,540
It's available in small.

620
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
I saw it back then in school.

621
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
The young girls watch it.

622
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,540
And then they do it.

623
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
It's nothing special.

624
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
And of course they bow down to some wankers.

625
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
And force them to prostitution.

626
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
I already told you that.

627
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
Like in the other clip I made.

628
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
That's my example.

629
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,540
And as I said

630
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,540
A good time to get back to the film.

631
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,540
He puts it all so well.

632
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
And this stupid brother

633
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
In the end he comes back

634
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,540
Into this trap.

635
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,540
Into this therapy.

636
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
And they just sit there and

637
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
He gives himself to this system.

638
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
Because Robert Pattinson is in jail.

639
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,540
He doesn't come out anymore.

640
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,540
That's it.

641
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
And he gets there for the rest of his life

642
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,540
In this therapy.

643
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
And of course his brother

644
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
Had a better plan for him.

645
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,540
To live somewhere in freedom.

646
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
Not in this cruel capitalist life.

647
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,540
Where he is only gangled.

648
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
And where nothing can happen.

649
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,540
A wonderful film.

650
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
A 10 out of 10 for me.

651
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,540
I don't know if the list

652
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,540
That the movie gives me

653
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,540
Or if he sorts them

654
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,540
According to rating.

655
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,540
Or if I press F5.

656
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,540
But I can read what's written here.

657
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,540
It's all a snowball system.

658
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Of course it's all a snowball system.

659
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
Well paid employee of Antifa GmbH.

660
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Good evening.

661
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Why are leftists so core disabled?

662
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
I think the USA

663
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Will be split sooner or later.

664
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,540
What do you mean

665
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
With core disabled Dubai?

666
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
I have to say.

667
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,540
I have already noticed

668
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,540
That you tend to the right direction.

669
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,540
But to ask the question like that

670
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Is useless.

671
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
The USA will be split sooner or later.

672
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
In my opinion the USA are already split.

673
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,540
For a very long time.

674
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,540
I wrote in the stream of Wetzelt

675
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,540
Trump is therefore

676
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
In my opinion not a good president

677
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
For the USA itself.

678
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
Just because he made the biggest

679
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
Hex cuts of all time.

680
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,540
He really has the record

681
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,540
For the upper 1%

682
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
To get more out and pay less taxes.

683
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
And everything else he does

684
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,540
Is of course only smoking.

685
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
That is not sustainable.

686
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,540
Because he keeps making the pyramids more pointed.

687
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
He makes sure that the redistribution

688
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,540
Is getting more and more intense.

689
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
And yes.

690
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,540
In my opinion they are already split.

691
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,540
That has now also been shown

692
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,540
In such unrest as back then

693
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
In Wetzelt Charlottesville

694
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,540
Where the guy just drove his car through the demo.

695
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,540
Or later of course

696
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,540
With all kinds of Black Lives Matters

697
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,540
Where there was an autonomous zone

698
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Where no police could enter.

699
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,540
Because of course all Americans with their Gatling

700
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,540
Stand all over the place.

701
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,540
And then they made some stress.

702
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,540
There is already a lot going on

703
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,540
In this country.

704
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,540
I said, in my opinion

705
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Can this only end

706
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,540
That the rich people

707
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,540
Pull back their communities

708
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
With a fortress wall around them.

709
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,540
And then it runs.

710
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,540
I smell political conditioning

711
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,540
Around childhood.

712
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,540
It definitely sits deep.

713
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,540
Political conditioning

714
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,540
I wouldn't say that.

715
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,540
I think

716
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,540
Of course it is being tried

717
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,540
But it doesn't sit with children.

718
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,540
Children are not political.

719
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,540
Politically

720
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
It is a kind of higher structure

721
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,540
Which at some point in time

722
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,540
Comes in as a pattern of thought.

723
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,540
Politics is for us

724
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
An extra pattern of thought.

725
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,540
You would do something politically

726
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,540
Which you don't do privately.

727
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,540
These are separated things.

728
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,540
Children are far too honest

729
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
And far too grounded.

730
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,540
They are

731
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,540
Very far

732
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,540
Elementary

733
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,540
What you see with children

734
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
Is that

735
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,540
After two years

736
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,540
They have a lot of

737
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,540
Stereotypes

738
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,540
In them.

739
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,540
The first one is man and woman.

740
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,540
That is very important to classification.

741
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,540
Their whole brain

742
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,540
Is designed to

743
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,540
In the first three or four years

744
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,540
To only do feature extraction and classification.

745
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,540
And that is where it gets clarified.

746
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,540
I don't know

747
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,540
I can at least see that

748
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,540
With my daughter.

749
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,540
But that depends on what kind of input comes in.

750
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,540
And you can see that

751
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,540
That these typical men and women

752
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,540
Roll.

753
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,540
The girls should rather

754
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,540
Sit in a corner and read a good book

755
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,540
And the boys should go out.

756
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,540
That is measured

757
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,540
At different kindergartens and schools.

758
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,540
That the staff likes it that way.

759
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,540
And that they don't want to force it.

760
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,540
For example the classic gender roles.

761
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,540
That girls are bad at math.

762
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,540
And boys are the genius engineers.

763
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,540
That is measured

764
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,540
In the kindergarten by themselves.

765
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,540
That is done subconsciously.

766
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,540
And of course many parents do it that way.

767
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
That is an indoctrination.

768
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,540
And the political

769
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
Has mostly something to do

770
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,540
With the social environment

771
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
Where you come from.

772
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,540
Of course in the long run

773
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
But especially at the beginning

774
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,540
Kindergarten, early childhood

775
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,540
That is not the case with politics.

776
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,540
I would agree

777
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,540
That later

778
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,540
With 14 to 18

779
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,540
That there is something

780
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,540
That goes in.

781
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,540
Whereby

782
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,540
With 14 to 18

783
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,540
You are mostly

784
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,540
If everything goes wrong

785
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,540
Relatively independent.

786
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,540
I would imagine

787
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,540
I thought about it myself.

788
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,540
I was disappointed

789
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,540
By the left for a long time.

790
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,540
And then I was out.

791
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,540
With 18 to 25

792
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,540
I was

793
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,540
Not interested

794
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,540
In politics at all.

795
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
But also

796
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
For left, right and so on.

797
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,540
Of course I was always a lefty.

798
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,540
But I felt alienated

799
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,540
By the left scene.

800
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,540
I had green dreadlocks

801
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,540
When I was a teenager.

802
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,540
I was a real disgusting punk.

803
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,540
But later

804
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,540
I politicized myself

805
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,540
By sitting too often in front of the computer.

806
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,540
That is essential.

807
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,540
That's how it came about.

808
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,540
And that's how it came about with my channel.

809
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,540
So

810
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,540
Something happens

811
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,540
In the sense of anyone.

812
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,540
And if it does not happen for profit

813
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,540
But for reasons

814
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,540
For the existence of humanity

815
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,540
As a pattern of thought

816
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,540
A pattern of thought is formed

817
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,540
So that the sexual intercourse decreases or so.

818
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,540
I would say

819
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,540
12 to 15-year puberty phase.

820
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,540
Yes, possible.

821
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,540
So it is definitely so

822
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,540
If I had to conclude from my observation

823
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,540
I also know

824
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,540
Many where I would say

825
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,540
Yes, that has to happen at some point

826
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
In this time

827
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,540
That the parents

828
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,540
Their ideology

829
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,540
The children

830
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,540
I would see that too.

831
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,540
But the most important thing

832
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,540
That happens much earlier.

833
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,540
I am convinced of that.

834
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,540
This thing with the ideology

835
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,540
You can then choose yourself at some point.

836
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,540
If you are 15

837
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,540
Then you are able to see the contradictions

838
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,540
Of the ideology of the parents.

839
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,540
That's what most people identify with puberty.

840
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,540
They just see the contradictions of the parents.

841
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,540
And they hold them in the face

842
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,540
And say

843
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,540
That's why I have always kept you.

844
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,540
They recognize that first

845
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,540
They have a mental crisis in puberty.

846
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,540
They realize that they have lived a lie for 10-14 years.

847
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,540
I thought my parents are gods.

848
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,540
And suddenly it doesn't work anymore.

849
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,540
You could also see that with puberty.

850
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,540
It's just a awakening.

851
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
That's where the brain

852
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,540
Has reached this stage of development.

853
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,540
To reflect on oneself

854
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,540
And to reflect on others

855
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,540
And to move into others

856
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,540
Where this stage is completely closed.

857
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,540
That's the first result.

858
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,540
What's going on with the world?

859
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,540
It's totally contradicting itself.

860
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
There are a thousand contradictions.

861
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,540
It's not clear at all.

862
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,540
That's probably called puberty.

863
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,540
And then it has something to do with farting and farting.

864
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
But that's another thing.

865
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,540
That's also coming.

866
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,540
I'm thinking right now

867
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,540
I have to pee.

868
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,540
I've already had too much beer before.

869
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,540
Before we continue with the next film

870
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,540
I'll turn on the music first.

871
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,540
I'm thinking about what to do.

872
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,540
Write in the chat

873
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,540
If you want something hard

874
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,540
Or if you want something relaxed.

875
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,540
And I'll think about it.

876
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,540
What's hard?

877
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,540
Yes, that you say that.

878
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,540
Death row.

879
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,540
I could have thought of that.

880
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,540
Okay, but because you want death row

881
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,540
You definitely want some black metal.

882
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,540
And I don't like that.

883
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,540
Hard, relaxed.

884
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,540
Difficult.

885
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,540
It works, of course.

886
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,540
But I'll do it first.

887
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,540
A little bit of death metal.

888
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,540
And then I'm going to pee

889
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,540
And then I'll be right there.

890
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,540
And then I'm going to pee and then I'll be right there.

891
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,540
We'll do it here.

892
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,540
There, that's good.

893
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,540
That's good.

894
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,540
That's good.

895
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,540
That's good.

896
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,540
That's good.

897
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,540
That's good.

898
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,540
That's good.

899
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,540
Are you ready?

900
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,540
That's good.

901
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,540
That's good.

902
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,540
That's good.

903
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,540
That's good.

904
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,540
Does he think that the coal soup was bad?

905
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,540
While he spits them out?

906
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,540
or does it only look like a bandwagon?

907
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:25,540
Well, that's a stylistic tool that doesn't appeal to the common listener at all.

908
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,540
That's anti-casualization.

909
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:37,540
And when I was young, I listened to Korn and Rammstein.

910
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,540
The first Korn album and the first Rammstein album.

911
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,540
I listened to them in the first and second grade.

912
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,540
That was the shit back then. I thought that was crazy.

913
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:51,540
And then I was in a fan camp.

914
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,540
Maybe I've already told you the story.

915
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,540
In a fan camp there was a buddy of a teacher.

916
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,540
An awful metalhead. It's clear to me now that he was a metalhead.

917
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,540
He said, here boy, you can already hear the crazy music.

918
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Come to my car. I have a great facility in the car.

919
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,540
No homo, no pedo.

920
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,540
And then he played me Morbid Angel or Cannibal Corpse or something like that.

921
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,540
And it was just exactly that.

922
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,540
What is the man doing there? Why does it sound so stupid? What is that? What is he supposed to do?

923
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,540
And then he said, if you listen to something like that now, you'll hear something like that later.

924
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,540
And I said, no, that doesn't make any sense at all. It's shit.

925
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,540
And it's actually like that. You have to develop a ear for it.

926
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,540
It's like for a good wine or for a whiskey or something.

927
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,540
You have to develop a taste for it.

928
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,540
You have to have a sense of sensibility.

929
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,540
And with that kind of music, I've had the craziest thing with black metal.

930
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,540
For ten years, after I've already heard super extreme music,

931
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,540
I've still dedicated myself to black metal for its rudeness.

932
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,540
And it's only been a few years since I've been able to hear black metal.

933
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,540
And yes, that's how it is for the...

934
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,540
So if you've never heard that before, then it's not for you.

935
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,540
You're thinking, what's the point of that?

936
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,540
First of all, it sounds super stupid. You're thinking, what kind of stupid thing is that?

937
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,540
But that's always the case with art.

938
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
And the most obviously stupid thing is, of course, hip-hop.

939
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,540
And that attracts everyone, of course, because it's very easy to understand.

940
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,540
That's full, no casualization.

941
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,540
Because that's all about how you become a pimp.

942
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:24,540
And the boys think that with 12, 13, 14, 15, of course, that's great.

943
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,540
Anyway, another topic.

944
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,540
So, hard, relaxed comes next.

945
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,540
And then comes relaxed electromove.

946
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,540
That's all I have.

947
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,540
Ah.

948
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,540
A Mindener?

949
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,540
No, he didn't come from Minden.

950
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,540
He came here directly from my city.

951
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,540
I sometimes see him on the Christmas market.

952
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,540
And I tell him that he shaped me.

953
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,540
As a little child.

954
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,540
Of course, he can't remember it, but I can't remember him.

955
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,540
I always tell him that.

956
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,540
Yes, of course.

957
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,540
So, let's move on to the list.

958
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,540
Let's move on to the list.

959
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,540
So, the next thing on my list is the film.

960
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,540
Which is also completely unknown.

961
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,540
Black 47.

962
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
I don't even know what it's called.

963
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,540
No, it's also called Black 47 in German.

964
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,540
And the film takes place in Ireland.

965
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:19,540
At the time when the British Empire was still big at the start.

966
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,540
And since then, the Iranians have had the worst hatred of Great Britain.

967
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,540
Because they were the colonial powers.

968
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,540
They were occupiers.

969
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
They just went through imperialism.

970
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,540
With the Iranians.

971
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,540
With the Gaelic people, who just wanted to wander around.

972
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,540
And the film begins.

973
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,540
There comes a soldier from the war again.

974
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,540
Who swore for the British.

975
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,540
He is a traitor for the Iranians.

976
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:50,540
And he just wants to go home to his family.

977
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,540
And he arrives and sees that the house is destroyed.

978
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,540
The family is no longer really there.

979
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,540
And he is then first of all taken into this paper logic.

980
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,540
Who are you? Why don't you have ID papers?

981
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,540
And so on and so forth.

982
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,540
Then he smashes them all away.

983
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,540
And so it really rots out.

984
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,540
And the scene that made capitalism critical for me.

985
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,540
Is the situation.

986
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,540
That there are the remains of his family.

987
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,540
I believe his sister.

988
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,540
His little sister has a child.

989
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,540
She lives with her husband.

990
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,540
In an abandoned house.

991
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,540
In the middle of nowhere.

992
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,540
In the middle of Pampa there is nothing.

993
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,540
Except such a tram and a stone house.

994
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,540
With a straw roof around it.

995
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,540
And it's cold as hell. It's winter.

996
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,540
The people die out there just because it's so cold.

997
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,540
His old original house.

998
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,540
So where she comes from, it's bombed away.

999
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,540
There is nothing left.

1000
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,540
And they live in this house where nothing is.

1001
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,540
Where nobody bothers.

1002
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,540
And suddenly the British militia arrives.

1003
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,540
And ensures justice and order.

1004
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,540
Because they don't even own this property.

1005
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,540
They don't own this property at all.

1006
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,540
It's written on a piece of paper.

1007
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,540
That it belongs to someone else.

1008
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,540
And nobody bothers.

1009
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,540
But they just bother.

1010
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,540
Because they are the colonial power.

1011
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,540
And they want to suppress them.

1012
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,540
And with that the film starts.

1013
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,540
That's the 14th or 15th minute.

1014
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,540
Or maybe half an hour.

1015
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,540
There is this scene.

1016
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,540
And it's so absurd.

1017
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,540
Because it shows exactly how it is with the property.

1018
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,540
It's cold as hell.

1019
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,540
And they get shot.

1020
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,540
That means they die.

1021
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,540
Because it's minus 10 degrees.

1022
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,540
The man thinks it's shit.

1023
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,540
And he gets shot by the soldiers.

1024
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,540
Who only do their duty.

1025
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,540
And in the film it's shown very well.

1026
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,540
If you talk to some of the irons.

1027
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,540
At best old irons.

1028
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,540
They have the story in their pockets.

1029
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,540
How it is with the British.

1030
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,540
With the great power of Great Britain.

1031
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,540
Why they are so powerful.

1032
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,540
Why they are so powerful.

1033
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,540
Why they are so powerful.

1034
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,540
And how they have

1035
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,540
in the smallest

1036
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,540
already

1037
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,540
built out their power structures.

1038
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,540
And just suppressed people.

1039
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,540
Just for fun.

1040
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,540
The film is a bit dystopian.

1041
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,540
The film seems to me

1042
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,540
so dark and so disgusting.

1043
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,540
And everything is hopeless.

1044
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,540
And so really disgusting.

1045
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,540
It reminds me of The Road.

1046
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,540
Just because of the climate.

1047
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,540
Because it's so shit and so dystopian.

1048
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,540
It's just really shit.

1049
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,540
And that's why

1050
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,540
the film plays in the past.

1051
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,540
But he sees

1052
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,540
in front of my inner eye

1053
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,540
he felt

1054
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,540
as if it was a representation

1055
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,540
for a future version.

1056
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,540
As if it was a dystopian film.

1057
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,540
As if we could go back

1058
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,540
in such a situation.

1059
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,540
That's how the film affects me.

1060
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,540
I can't really describe it.

1061
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,540
Because nobody would think

1062
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,540
that this is a capitalism film.

1063
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,540
But somehow for me

1064
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,540
it's probably because of my selection bias.

1065
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,540
Because I make so many

1066
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,540
YouTube videos.

1067
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,540
And I have this English channel

1068
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,540
one year longer than the German one.

1069
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,540
I'm more active with the Snow Wall system.

1070
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,540
With all these ideas.

1071
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,540
To criticize that.

1072
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,540
I think that's the reason.

1073
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,540
It's always like that.

1074
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,540
When you have tunnel vision

1075
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,540
you only have the nail

1076
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,540
and the hammer.

1077
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,540
That's about it.

1078
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,540
The next film is The Big Short.

1079
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,540
I don't need to talk about it.

1080
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,540
It's clear.

1081
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,540
The best part of the film is Brad Pitt.

1082
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,540
Like with Killings and Softly.

1083
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,540
He's a really cool guy.

1084
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,540
But I don't need to talk about it.

1085
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,540
The film is well known.

1086
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,540
It's 2008, financial crisis,

1087
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,540
perfectly explained.

1088
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,540
In a really cool movie.

1089
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,540
All around.

1090
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,540
Hollywood.

1091
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,540
Nice people are shown.

1092
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,540
They tell you something.

1093
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,540
The film tells

1094
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,540
a nice story.

1095
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,540
Around this whole situation.

1096
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,540
And how criminal

1097
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,540
the banks and the rating agencies are.

1098
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,540
How criminal they are.

1099
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,540
That's shown really well.

1100
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,540
And of course it's fantastic.

1101
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,540
Every single aspect,

1102
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,540
every level of the Snow Wall system

1103
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,540
is shown.

1104
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,540
I just missed the context.

1105
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,540
You're the one with the hot air balloon, right?

1106
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,540
I don't get it.

1107
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,540
Kvairz wrote a Minden-Thunder.

1108
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,540
I thought he meant someone from Minden.

1109
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,540
Then Felix Fuchs-Hase

1110
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,540
felt like he was talking.

1111
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,540
Because he's from Minden.

1112
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,540
Now Kvairz says at least.

1113
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,540
And then he says something about the hot air balloon.

1114
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,540
That's too hard for me.

1115
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,540
In Hip-Hop

1116
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,540
there are underground styles.

1117
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,540
Psycho-Core for example.

1118
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,540
Where you think WTF.

1119
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,540
The majority is categorization

1120
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,540
up to 10. But another topic.

1121
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,540
Sure, in Hip-Hop

1122
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,540
actually

1123
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,540
I never really thought about it.

1124
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,540
But I always had the feeling that

1125
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,540
Hip-Hop is about class struggle.

1126
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,540
About how you can

1127
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,540
as a little man

1128
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,540
fight your life in the worst way

1129
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,540
in the USA, where there is no solidarity.

1130
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,540
And if you grow up in a block

1131
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,540
somewhere in a new settlement

1132
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,540
in the East it's nothing different.

1133
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,540
You can do Hip-Hop about it.

1134
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,540
Because the stories of the streets

1135
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:44,540
happen there. The whole country.

1136
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,540
You see it.

1137
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,540
And you have something to tell.

1138
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,540
And that's being transported in Hip-Hop.

1139
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,540
It's being transported very well.

1140
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,540
Because you don't need musical skills for it.

1141
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,540
To make a beat is trivial.

1142
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,540
Or you always find someone who can do it.

1143
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,540
And the rest is alienation.

1144
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Then you can rap about it.

1145
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,540
Of course you don't need the skills.

1146
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,540
It's all art.

1147
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,540
Because you have to do it with the rhyme.

1148
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,540
And really cool boys can do it live.

1149
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,540
You give them a theme about what they should rap about

1150
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,540
and then they do it.

1151
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,540
That's a lot of art. I don't want to deny that.

1152
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,540
But mainstream rap is of course ridiculous.

1153
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,540
In Germany it's even more ridiculous.

1154
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,540
Because everything that happens in Germany

1155
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,540
in mainstream is really the funniest.

1156
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,540
It's always copied from the USA.

1157
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,540
They just copy the trends from there.

1158
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,540
And then they make it worse.

1159
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:32,540
You see that everywhere.

1160
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,540
With Joko and Klaas.

1161
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,540
With the men's world.

1162
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,540
It's just a copy of Me Too.

1163
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,540
Things like that.

1164
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,540
Even that. It's super ridiculous.

1165
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,540
And you see it even crazier with the German influencers.

1166
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,540
They just copy content directly.

1167
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,540
And the one who puts it on the top

1168
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,540
is of course Mani Boy.

1169
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,540
Mani Boy is just a funny guy.

1170
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,540
With all his nonsense.

1171
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,540
100% is basically every video

1172
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,540
of any other American influencer

1173
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,540
who makes Hip-Hop.

1174
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,540
100%. Just copied.

1175
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,540
It's just funny.

1176
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,540
What's the next movie?

1177
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,540
The next movie.

1178
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,540
The big crash margin call.

1179
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,540
It's at least as awesome

1180
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,540
as The Big Short.

1181
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,540
But it's a bit more unknown.

1182
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,540
First with Kevin Spacey.

1183
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,540
It's great.

1184
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,540
But mostly

1185
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,540
from a different perspective.

1186
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,540
The movie is also about

1187
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,540
the 2008 financial crisis.

1188
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,540
But from the perspective

1189
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,540
of The Big Short

1190
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,540
the decision-making levels

1191
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,540
the banks, the politics

1192
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,540
the rating agencies

1193
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,540
the big companies

1194
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,540
From this perspective

1195
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,540
The Big Short is not represented.

1196
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,540
It's a middle class.

1197
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,540
With the big crash

1198
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,540
at margin call

1199
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,540
it's about the top level

1200
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,540
of some kind of

1201
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,540
I assume

1202
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,540
some financial advisory company

1203
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,540
or something like that.

1204
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,540
Could be another

1205
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,540
snowball system. Doesn't matter.

1206
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,540
It's so awesome.

1207
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,540
It's just like

1208
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,540
a piece of paper.

1209
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,540
The audience doesn't know

1210
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,540
what's on the paper.

1211
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,540
They panic.

1212
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,540
They want to know what's on the paper.

1213
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,540
But the audience doesn't know

1214
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,540
what's on the paper.

1215
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,540
The paper goes all the way

1216
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,540
up in the snowball system.

1217
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,540
At some point Kevin Spacey comes

1218
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,540
by. Kevin Spacey is

1219
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,540
one of the last

1220
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,540
in this pyramid.

1221
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:54,540
And that's super awesome.

1222
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,540
Because on the paper

1223
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,540
our system collabs.

1224
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:00,540
Our mathematical models

1225
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,540
have results.

1226
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,540
And everyone sees the crash

1227
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,540
and has to limit the damage.

1228
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,540
And in the movie

1229
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,540
it's shown pretty well.

1230
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,540
The smallest wankers

1231
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,540
die from their job.

1232
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,540
They tank the damage.

1233
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,540
In the end.

1234
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,540
People like Kevin Spacey

1235
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,540
The absolute

1236
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,540
king is a famous actor.

1237
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,540
I can't remember his name.

1238
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:28,540
He plays a great role.

1239
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,540
Because he's the absolute

1240
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,540
top mafia mob.

1241
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,540
Everyone has respect for him.

1242
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,540
And the best scene

1243
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,540
in the movie

1244
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,540
is where

1245
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,540
a small

1246
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,540
middleman

1247
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,540
explains how the business works.

1248
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,540
That's so awesome.

1249
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,540
I laughed my ass off.

1250
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,540
I was so happy.

1251
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,540
That was super serious.

1252
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,540
In the cabrio he explains how the business works.

1253
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,540
And in the end

1254
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,540
the little wanker went to the toilet

1255
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,540
and puked.

1256
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,540
And that sucked.

1257
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,540
Just because he explained

1258
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,540
how messy capitalism really is.

1259
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,540
And that he lived a lie when he

1260
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,540
made the propaganda fairy

1261
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,540
to be successful

1262
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,540
and to be a great businessman.

1263
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,540
That's super shown in the movie.

1264
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,540
A great movie.

1265
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,540
And much less known than The Big Short.

1266
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,540
But totally wrong.

1267
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,540
He has to be known.

1268
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,540
Everyone should know him in the movie.

1269
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,540
He's like The Big Short.

1270
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,540
He tells about capitalism.

1271
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,540
He talks about it.

1272
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,540
You don't have to talk in metaphors.

1273
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,540
It's not a hidden story

1274
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,540
like in Good Time or Killing Them Softly

1275
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,540
where you have to think about it.

1276
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,540
It hits you right in the face.

1277
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,540
How it is with the alienation.

1278
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,540
And with the Wall Street.

1279
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,540
That's super.

1280
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,540
That's a really awesome movie.

1281
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,540
And he has so many details.

1282
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,540
So many details.

1283
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,540
Like I said, it starts with the note.

1284
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,540
And then all these dialogues.

1285
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,540
And Kevin Spacey is also

1286
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,540
and that's always the nice thing.

1287
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,540
You want to think that they are all winners of the system.

1288
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,540
But you can see very clearly that they are not.

1289
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,540
They all have a terrible life.

1290
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,540
Kevin Spacey is the main character.

1291
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,540
And he is also

1292
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,540
depicted a little bit

1293
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,540
of his private life.

1294
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,540
How toxic it all is.

1295
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,540
He's separated from his wife.

1296
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,540
The only flaw I have

1297
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,540
with The Big Crash is that

1298
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,540
the smart-spirited geek-nerd-2-type

1299
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,540
is an engineer.

1300
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,540
It's always depicted

1301
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,540
as if the engineers

1302
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,540
are the cool guys with the math

1303
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,540
and the crazy knowledge.

1304
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,540
But in reality it's more

1305
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,540
IT-ers,

1306
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,540
mathematicians or physicists

1307
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,540
who do this shit.

1308
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,540
Because they are the ones with the math skills.

1309
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,540
You have to imagine that in a pyramid.

1310
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,540
You have math, that's the shit.

1311
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,540
That's the real shit.

1312
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,540
But it's often too abstract.

1313
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,540
Only if you're up for it before, you go after the math

1314
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,540
in something else.

1315
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,540
Otherwise people just stay there in the math

1316
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,540
and prove that some 74-dimensional rings

1317
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,540
create some crazy algebras

1318
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,540
and structures

1319
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,540
and that's why they form a group.

1320
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,540
That's what they do.

1321
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,540
But there are two kinds of math.

1322
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,540
One is computer science,

1323
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,540
so IT.

1324
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,540
It's basically applied math.

1325
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,540
Theoretical Informatics 1 and 2

1326
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,540
are only about

1327
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,540
formal

1328
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,540
proofability and decision-making

1329
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,540
and things like that.

1330
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,540
And in the end Goedel's Inconvenience.

1331
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,540
And the other thing is physics.

1332
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,540
That's the description of what we see out here

1333
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,540
with the language of mathematics.

1334
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,540
Those are the two adults.

1335
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,540
And everything below that,

1336
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,540
biology,

1337
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,540
geology,

1338
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,540
economics,

1339
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,540
I don't even want to start with that.

1340
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,540
It doesn't count at all.

1341
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,540
That's a bastard.

1342
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,540
The priest once

1343
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,540
accidentally

1344
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,540
fucked a boy's ass, but a girl's

1345
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,540
and she got pregnant.

1346
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,540
That's the motto.

1347
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,540
And other than that

1348
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,540
chemistry, engineering,

1349
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,540
engineers,

1350
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,540
those are craftsmen,

1351
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,540
those are people with a screwdriver in their hands.

1352
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,540
The real nerds

1353
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,540
are math, physics

1354
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,540
and computer science.

1355
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:24,540
But computer science is difficult

1356
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,540
because you have a lot of computer scientists

1357
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:28,540
who do something far from mathematics.

1358
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,540
In the end they only become web designers

1359
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,540
or admins in some

1360
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,540
different structures and so on.

1361
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,540
But real computer science,

1362
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,540
the really crazy shit,

1363
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,540
that's super sexy.

1364
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,540
And I would go a little bit in that direction

1365
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,540
with cryptography, for example.

1366
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:46,540
That's what I'm working on right now.

1367
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,540
But also a lot of other things.

1368
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,540
Decisiveness problems, NP,

1369
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,540
completeness, stuff like that,

1370
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,540
Turing machine, everything that has to do with it.

1371
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,540
That's mathematics.

1372
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,540
That's completely clear.

1373
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,540
That's just a concrete application

1374
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,540
of the language.

1375
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,540
Because predictability is

1376
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,540
a question of mathematics.

1377
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,540
But it is occupied by computer science

1378
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,540
and there are

1379
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,540
extra lectures about it and so on.

1380
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,540
But in my opinion it all comes together.

1381
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,540
If you are a real physicist,

1382
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,540
you also include IT and math.

1383
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,540
If you are a real mathematician, you also include math and computer science.

1384
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,540
If you are a real mathematician, you also include math.

1385
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,540
Physics mostly not because

1386
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,540
it is an application

1387
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,540
that most IT people are not interested in.

1388
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,540
They want to understand how a quantum computer works.

1389
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,540
But that's a different story.

1390
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,540
I'm a little disappointed

1391
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,540
because of the engineer.

1392
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,540
But otherwise the movie is great.

1393
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,540
Except for the engineer, the movie is absolutely great.

1394
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,540
Where am I?

1395
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,540
I'll read a little more.

1396
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,540
Yes, enough awesome hip-hop.

1397
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,540
Honestly, I've already heard

1398
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,540
from Alligator that it should be nice.

1399
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,540
I can't say anything about the others.

1400
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,540
Yandilay, Semidilux, Dendemann.

1401
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,540
It all sounds like nonsense to me.

1402
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,540
Who do I like the most?

1403
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,540
The one over there.

1404
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,540
The one hanging on the wall over there.

1405
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,540
Captain Peng.

1406
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,540
He is great.

1407
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,540
Captain Peng, can you

1408
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,540
take a look at it?

1409
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,540
There are a few things on YouTube.

1410
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,540
Super awesome, of course very poetic.

1411
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,540
Deep-seated philosophical texts.

1412
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,540
Super packed.

1413
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,540
Super packed, I think it's great.

1414
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,540
I'm a fan, I've seen it live.

1415
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,540
Captain Peng and the tetake from Delphi.

1416
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,540
The woman was already pregnant.

1417
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,540
We pulled ourselves in, that was great.

1418
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,540
I like him for example.

1419
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,540
I'm also really into Romano.

1420
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,540
Just because of the middleman.

1421
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,540
Because the guy represents this ambivalence.

1422
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,540
He has so much because

1423
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,540
he grew up in the 90s.

1424
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,540
He ate it all up.

1425
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,540
You can tell by the way he talks

1426
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,540
that he has all these cultural influences.

1427
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,540
And that's great.

1428
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,540
I drove to Osnabrück

1429
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,540
and saw him live and showed him

1430
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,540
my metal cut and we did a high five.

1431
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,540
That was great. I like him.

1432
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,540
He's just nice.

1433
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,540
And he does funny stuff.

1434
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,540
He also does capitalism criticism.

1435
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,540
If he wants to.

1436
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,540
I'm sure there's good hip-hop.

1437
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,540
Especially because

1438
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,540
it's a grassroots thing.

1439
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,540
From the streets.

1440
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,540
With attitudes.

1441
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,540
It's the struggle.

1442
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,540
Against the hierarchy and the shit.

1443
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,540
Against our expansion system.

1444
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,540
You have to say how shitty it is.

1445
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,540
I just remembered another movie.

1446
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,540
I have to play it before I continue.

1447
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,540
Or I'll forget it.

1448
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,540
It's called

1449
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,540
The one with Jennifer Lopez.

1450
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:42,540
Don't be surprised.

1451
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,540
It's great.

1452
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,540
It's called Hustlers.

1453
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,540
Hustlers.

1454
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,540
I'll talk about it later.

1455
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,540
Then we'll have it.

1456
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,540
It's a great movie.

1457
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,540
Hustlers.

1458
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:58,540
Where do I have it?

1459
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,540
Imagine.

1460
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,540
Jennifer Lopez

1461
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,540
is a stripper

1462
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,540
in the USA.

1463
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,540
She has to get around

1464
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,540
and she has a kid.

1465
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,540
She has to pay the rent.

1466
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,540
Like all Americans.

1467
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,540
It's always the complete alienation.

1468
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,540
They only do the job because of the money.

1469
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,540
She finds out

1470
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,540
that you can get bigger money

1471
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,540
when you do private parties

1472
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,540
with the fat punks.

1473
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,540
You only need

1474
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,540
a few girls.

1475
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,540
She knows enough girls

1476
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,540
that you can get around.

1477
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,540
The great thing is

1478
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,540
we do private parties

1479
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:44,540
with their wives.

1480
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,540
They don't like their wives.

1481
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,540
They are managers.

1482
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,540
They all have a wife.

1483
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,540
So they do this.

1484
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,540
They do a party with their wives.

1485
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,540
They give them drugs.

1486
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:58,540
They steal their credit cards

1487
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,540
and take the money.

1488
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,540
They pull the money

1489
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,540
out of the hierarchy

1490
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,540
like Robin Hood.

1491
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:08,540
That's the business model.

1492
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,540
It works well.

1493
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:12,540
In the movie

1494
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,540
you can see certain aspects

1495
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,540
of how it works.

1496
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,540
With the strip-shops

1497
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,540
and the logic of use.

1498
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,540
If you are too bad

1499
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,540
you have to piss yourself off.

1500
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,540
You have to do casualization

1501
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,540
and marketing.

1502
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,540
It looks great.

1503
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,540
Not with academic words.

1504
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,540
Not like in a lecture.

1505
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,540
Just like it looks

1506
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,540
on the street.

1507
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,540
That's awesome.

1508
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,540
It's not academic.

1509
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,540
It's easy for everyone

1510
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,540
why the problems

1511
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,540
are for this person

1512
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,540
and why they act like that.

1513
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,540
That's great.

1514
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:54,540
Jennifer Lopez

1515
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,540
does a great business out of it.

1516
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,540
She modifies it

1517
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,540
and expands it.

1518
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,540
She gets more girls

1519
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,540
who can take more orders.

1520
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,540
Who expand more

1521
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,540
and maybe to other cities.

1522
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,540
That's great.

1523
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,540
I haven't seen the movie

1524
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,540
for a long time.

1525
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,540
It's not that long

1526
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,540
but I don't know how it ends.

1527
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,540
The movie was

1528
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,540
a great criticism of capitalism.

1529
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,540
It's a perfect movie

1530
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,540
because it shows

1531
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,540
a certain aspect

1532
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,540
of capitalism

1533
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,540
that you can't kill.

1534
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,540
It's about

1535
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,540
the business aspects

1536
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,540
of capitalism.

1537
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,540
Jennifer Lopez has to calculate

1538
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,540
and clear her business.

1539
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,540
She has to stay clean

1540
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,540
and have a clear mind.

1541
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,540
I've seen

1542
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,540
another movie

1543
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,540
where a woman

1544
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,540
is hosting

1545
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,540
poker tournaments.

1546
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,540
She's crazy.

1547
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,540
What was the name of the movie?

1548
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,540
If my wife

1549
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,540
would watch it,

1550
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,540
she would have

1551
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,540
drunk too much alcohol

1552
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,540
after the barbecue.

1553
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,540
I think she's drunk already.

1554
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,540
If she would watch it,

1555
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,540
she would know the movie.

1556
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,540
It's a movie

1557
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,540
where a woman

1558
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,540
is hosting

1559
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,540
poker tournaments.

1560
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,540
This nerd

1561
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,540
also participates.

1562
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,540
Who participates?

1563
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,540
Kevin Costner.

1564
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,540
I just need to go through

1565
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,540
the movie list with Kevin Costner.

1566
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,540
Kevin Costner.

1567
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,540
I click on it.

1568
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,540
Filmography.

1569
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,540
Then I scroll down.

1570
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,540
This has to happen.

1571
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,540
The movie is called Molly's Game.

1572
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,540
Great.

1573
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,540
Molly's Game.

1574
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,540
Not bad.

1575
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,540
I'll put it in the list.

1576
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,540
Great movie about capitalism.

1577
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,540
It's like this.

1578
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:10,540
Kevin Costner

1579
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,540
has, I think,

1580
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,540
three children.

1581
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,540
And Kevin Costner is a great guy.

1582
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,540
The woman is still awake.

1583
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,540
I already took over the job.

1584
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,540
I found out the movie.

1585
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,540
But it's funny.

1586
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,540
You can talk to the boys

1587
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,540
if you write funny things.

1588
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,540
He has three children.

1589
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,540
They are all elite children.

1590
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,540
He promotes and demands

1591
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,540
endlessly.

1592
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,540
He makes real professionals out of him.

1593
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,540
Everything they do is to the max.

1594
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,540
Only pro-gamer-wise.

1595
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,540
High level, upper point, one percent.

1596
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,540
If you bring performance,

1597
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,540
you have to get the gold medal in the Olympics.

1598
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,540
For example, at the ski jump.

1599
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,540
Molly,

1600
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,540
the main character,

1601
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,540
she does ski jumping.

1602
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,540
She pulls something in here

1603
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,540
and gets something crazy everywhere.

1604
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,540
A finish here and there.

1605
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,540
Super cool.

1606
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,540
The movie is so funny

1607
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,540
because it shows

1608
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:10,540
exactly this scaling

1609
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:12,540
and the business model.

1610
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,540
It's off-secret

1611
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:16,540
because

1612
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,540
luck in this scale

1613
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,540
is forbidden in the USA

1614
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,540
as soon as you take something from the pot.

1615
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,540
As soon as you take a profit.

1616
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,540
It's well represented.

1617
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,540
She has a lawyer

1618
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,540
and then there's a trial.

1619
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,540
It's about honor

1620
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,540
and now

1621
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,540
it's about

1622
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,540
it's about

1623
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,540
patriarchy

1624
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,540
and how women

1625
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:46,540
in this world

1626
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,540
can achieve more

1627
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,540
if they want to.

1628
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,540
They have to push through.

1629
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,540
The fight, the struggle,

1630
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,540
it's so well represented.

1631
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:58,540
And she's a crazy troll.

1632
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,540
She can do everything.

1633
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,540
She's very intellectual

1634
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,540
and she looks good

1635
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,540
and she could achieve everything.

1636
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,540
But she wants to do

1637
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,540
these half-illegal business.

1638
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,540
That's her thing.

1639
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,540
She just wanted to get her daddy

1640
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:16,540
out of it.

1641
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,540
But the movie is great

1642
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,540
and it's about capitalism.

1643
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,540
Mully's Game

1644
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,540
I can only recommend it.

1645
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,540
It's not direct.

1646
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,540
It's not like Margin Call

1647
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,540
or The Big Shot where you say

1648
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,540
capitalism is going to blow your face.

1649
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,540
You look at it from the perspective

1650
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,540
with the glasses

1651
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,540
that I want to show you.

1652
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,540
It's all a snowball system.

1653
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,540
Look where the snowball system is.

1654
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,540
Then you see the snowball systems everywhere.

1655
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,540
It's no wonder.

1656
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,540
The next movie

1657
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,540
that I want to talk about

1658
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,540
is the first movie

1659
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,540
with Robert Pattinson

1660
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,540
that I saw

1661
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,540
where I thought,

1662
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,540
maybe this guy has potential.

1663
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,540
Cosmopolis

1664
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,540
The movie itself is not great.

1665
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,540
It's almost an art movie.

1666
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,540
I don't want to say David Lynch

1667
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,540
but it seems

1668
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,540
like an art movie

1669
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,540
because it has

1670
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,540
absurd actions.

1671
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,540
Robert Pattinson seems

1672
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,540
to be an extremely rich guy

1673
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:26,540
who drives around in a limousine.

1674
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:28,540
And outside the limousine

1675
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,540
the whole world collapses.

1676
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,540
Probably after 2008

1677
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:34,540
in a financial crash.

1678
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,540
That's the setting.

1679
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,540
That's what I think.

1680
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,540
It's not really named.

1681
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,540
He does his rounds

1682
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,540
with his limousine,

1683
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:46,540
goes to stores, has quests.

1684
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,540
And in the end

1685
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,540
it culminates

1686
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,540
because he's hanging around

1687
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,540
in a limousine.

1688
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,540
I don't know if the woman will listen.

1689
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:58,540
There's a guy

1690
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,540
who was once released

1691
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,540
by his father

1692
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:04,540
and since then

1693
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,540
his existence sucks

1694
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,540
and he feels really bad.

1695
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:10,540
And the whole movie

1696
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,540
has this obvious touch.

1697
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,540
Take a look at the elite

1698
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,540
how disgusting they are on the road.

1699
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,540
That's shown really well.

1700
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,540
And Robert Pattinson

1701
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,540
is the perfect actor for it

1702
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,540
because he's a boy.

1703
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,540
He's a slippery boy.

1704
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:28,540
He's a Christian Bale

1705
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,540
American Psycho-like

1706
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,540
but without muckies.

1707
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,540
A really slippery boy.

1708
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,540
You look at him when he's wearing a suit

1709
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,540
and you think, is he unsympathetic?

1710
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,540
That's a rich,

1711
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,540
shabby wessie footsie

1712
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,540
who grew up with a golden spoon

1713
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,540
and is a really disgusting wessie.

1714
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,540
He got everything in shit

1715
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,540
and doesn't need to do anything

1716
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:52,540
and says, I earned it,

1717
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,540
I got my status, I got it.

1718
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,540
That's the movie.

1719
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:58,540
That's the feeling you get

1720
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:00,540
when you see this movie.

1721
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:02,540
And when you see Robert Pattinson

1722
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,540
when he shaved his ass.

1723
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,540
That's my suggestion

1724
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,540
because I like to think in these stereotypes.

1725
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,540
And that's

1726
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,540
definitely an interesting movie

1727
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,540
because, as I said, that was the first movie

1728
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,540
I think that was the movie after

1729
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,540
this Twilight shit.

1730
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,540
He already decided

1731
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:22,540
to make serious movies that are kind of crazy.

1732
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,540
And you have to expect that from him.

1733
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,540
Sure, this shit with the vampires

1734
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,540
he had to do

1735
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:30,540
I mean, it's not bad.

1736
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,540
You make a name, you earn money

1737
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,540
that's mainstream.

1738
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:36,540
But then the question is,

1739
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,540
do you continue in the snowball system?

1740
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,540
Or do you want to get even crazier

1741
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,540
and make even more shit movies?

1742
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,540
Or do you want to make interesting movies?

1743
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,540
And I would expect that from him.

1744
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,540
And as I said, all the movies

1745
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:50,540
I've seen with him

1746
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,540
made me think that he's a serious guy

1747
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,540
who actually wants

1748
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,540
real movie content.

1749
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,540
I think that's great.

1750
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,540
Cosmopolis.

1751
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:02,540
And as I said,

1752
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,540
you have to go

1753
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,540
in the video description

1754
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,540
and click on the link

1755
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:10,540
so you can see the list,

1756
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,540
the movie pilot list.

1757
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:14,540
So, what does it say here?

1758
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,540
Moneyboy is not satirical?

1759
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,540
Yes, Moneyboy.

1760
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:28,540
Like in the office.

1761
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,540
When it started with the swag

1762
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,540
and that's already a copy of another original.

1763
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,540
There's a hip-hopper who thinks it's serious.

1764
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,540
We also thought that it's a satire.

1765
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,540
But he's also touring with it

1766
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,540
and he's serious.

1767
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,540
He goes on stage and he does it.

1768
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,540
And there's the hip-hop crowd and they like it.

1769
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,540
And he likes it too. He's a hip-hop person.

1770
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:48,540
That's what I'm really talking about.

1771
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,540
He also does interviews with hip-hop channels

1772
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,540
and he lives this style.

1773
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,540
He also wrote a bachelor or master's

1774
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,540
about this topic with hip-hop

1775
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,540
and how to market it.

1776
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,540
I think that's an ambivalence.

1777
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,540
He finds it interesting,

1778
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:04,540
but he also focuses on the music.

1779
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,540
I really think that

1780
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,540
he's

1781
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:10,540
in this respect

1782
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,540
not a pure satire project

1783
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:14,540
like Akan and Stefan, for example.

1784
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,540
In case that tells you something.

1785
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:18,540
I'm a kid from the 90s

1786
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,540
so I know something like that.

1787
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,540
Yes, Moneyboy. Of course he's from Switzerland.

1788
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,540
No, Austria. I don't know.

1789
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,540
Wait. Wien City.

1790
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,540
He's from Wien City.

1791
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:30,540
That's right. Hip-hop against the original class struggle.

1792
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:32,540
The other two-packed songs are

1793
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,540
disaster,

1794
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:36,540
mainstream,

1795
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,540
class struggle. There's still enough hip-hop.

1796
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,540
I'm not an expert.

1797
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,540
But apart from hip-hop,

1798
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,540
Techno is a product made in Germany.

1799
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,540
Yes, it can be.

1800
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:48,540
I don't know them. I think they're super lame.

1801
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,540
Mühmänner hören Techno.

1802
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,540
I know enough people who aren't Mühmänner

1803
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,540
who also listen to Techno.

1804
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,540
In my opinion, this is the real musical

1805
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,540
milestone of Germany

1806
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,540
worldwide.

1807
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:04,540
The real musical milestone

1808
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,540
of Germany

1809
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,540
worldwide.

1810
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,540
First of all,

1811
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,540
all the classical composers.

1812
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,540
Sure, we don't need to talk about that.

1813
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:16,540
Germany, super sick.

1814
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:18,540
But then, Rammstein.

1815
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,540
Lol.

1816
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:22,540
Rammstein.

1817
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:24,540
If someone is an exporter here,

1818
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,540
then it's Rammstein.

1819
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:28,540
And then, of course, there are

1820
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:30,540
Scorpions.

1821
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:32,540
Just from the scale of success,

1822
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:34,540
Scorpions. And there are

1823
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:36,540
a few other creators, for example.

1824
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,540
In thrash metal, they're huge.

1825
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,540
Or...

1826
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,540
There are a few other really sick

1827
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,540
German bands. Necrophagous

1828
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,540
is, in my opinion, a purely German band.

1829
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,540
But they're only in

1830
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:50,540
tech desks, so to speak, legends.

1831
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,540
But they have a legend status for that.

1832
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:54,540
There are a lot of German bands

1833
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:56,540
that are really sick. And techno.

1834
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,540
I don't know much about that.

1835
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,540
But I would have thought,

1836
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,540
techno is identical all over the world.

1837
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,540
And there is no

1838
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:06,540
belonging to any artist

1839
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,540
or so. I thought, you can't

1840
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,540
distinguish that. That's such an

1841
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,540
indistinguishable, analogue mass.

1842
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,540
Whether you now take the techno song

1843
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,540
that takes one and a half hours

1844
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,540
from one, or party

1845
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,540
on the other track

1846
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,540
that takes one and a half hours or so.

1847
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,540
I don't know. You'd have to tell me

1848
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:26,540
which sick boys in techno

1849
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,540
are really hard.

1850
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:30,540
Kraftwerk or something. It could be.

1851
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,540
But they're just...

1852
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:34,540
They're actually pioneers.

1853
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,540
I don't know if they're counted

1854
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,540
as techno. I really don't know

1855
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,540
much about that.

1856
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,540
I, as an incoming engineer,

1857
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,540
feel very offended by that.

1858
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:54,540
Yes, well paid employee of

1859
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,540
Antifa GmbH. I'm sorry.

1860
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,540
But that's my

1861
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,540
elitist pissbubble in which

1862
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,540
I find myself. Because I just

1863
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,540
have too much experience

1864
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:06,540
with engineers. I'm

1865
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,540
an incoming doctor engineer.

1866
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:10,540
I'm myself. I'm also an engineer

1867
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,540
on paper. And in my

1868
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,540
last seven years I've only had to do

1869
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,540
with engineers.

1870
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,540
And that's my experience

1871
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,540
that I have there.

1872
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:22,540
Many of them can only blackbox.

1873
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:24,540
What they can't do very much is

1874
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,540
really apply mathematics.

1875
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,540
Most of them can't even understand

1876
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,540
what a Fourier transformation is.

1877
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,540
They don't understand that. They have

1878
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,540
mostly a symbolism. They can do that,

1879
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:36,540
but they can't interpret it. And in my

1880
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:38,540
exercises I see the inflation rate

1881
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,540
really brutal. I do exercises for

1882
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:42,540
engineers. Medical technology.

1883
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:44,540
That's essentially electrical engineering.

1884
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,540
And for a while I've only had the

1885
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,540
electrical engineer and medical engineer.

1886
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,540
They come from a school and

1887
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,540
two weeks before the school starts

1888
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,540
they do math preparation.

1889
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,540
But that's essentially

1890
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,540
what the Abitur doesn't do anymore.

1891
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:00,540
But what you need to get to the university.

1892
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,540
And there you can see how brutal

1893
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:04,540
that is.

1894
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,540
And it continues.

1895
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,540
It doesn't get any better.

1896
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,540
Then master students come out

1897
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,540
who are sitting in an exam

1898
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,540
with me. Electrical engineering.

1899
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:16,540
They don't write down the Roman law.

1900
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,540
That's super ridiculous. But classical

1901
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,540
is just Fourier analysis.

1902
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,540
Normal...

1903
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,540
I don't know. Normal

1904
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,540
functional theory I don't want to say.

1905
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,540
But algebra, so to speak.

1906
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,540
The nearest algebra.

1907
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,540
I only see deficits everywhere.

1908
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,540
And that's

1909
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,540
for some reason

1910
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,540
the problem is huge for engineers.

1911
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,540
And for physicists

1912
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,540
And the mathematicians

1913
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,540
I had to deal with until now,

1914
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,540
didn't.

1915
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,540
But that's a very personal

1916
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,540
view of me.

1917
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,540
Of course that can be different

1918
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,540
on the big scale.

1919
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,540
But that's what I see.

1920
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,540
That the engineer

1921
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,540
is more of a low-level

1922
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,540
flat wanker.

1923
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,540
And of course it can be that you're a

1924
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,540
crazy boy and a crazy dude and just want to use it

1925
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,540
and that's why you're an engineer.

1926
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:10,540
But that's not a thing.

1927
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,540
Nothing wrong with it.

1928
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,540
I only say what I see

1929
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,540
that I don't like about the nerds.

1930
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,540
But I think that's just alienation

1931
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,540
and inflation. They can't do anything for the people.

1932
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,540
So.

1933
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,540
Geology.

1934
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,540
No. Philosophers are so sexy

1935
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:28,540
that the will to profit against them

1936
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,540
stinks like rotten eggs.

1937
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,540
Yes, definitely. Philosophy is really nice.

1938
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,540
But...

1939
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:38,540
It's just...

1940
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:40,540
You can't earn your bread

1941
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:42,540
with philosophy.

1942
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,540
Unless you're a really awesome...

1943
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,540
David Garrett I almost said

1944
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,540
Richard David Precht or something like that.

1945
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,540
Who sells books and always

1946
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,540
holds himself in a camera because he's such a cool boy

1947
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,540
and has a bunch of groups and can do marketing.

1948
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,540
People like that can live well with it.

1949
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:58,540
So a few freaks who live in the media

1950
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:00,540
can live well with their philosophy

1951
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,540
or a few thinkers who

1952
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:04,540
really

1953
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,540
stick out with their thoughts.

1954
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:08,540
Otherwise you can do almost nothing with philosophy.

1955
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,540
Those are the ones who arrived at the top

1956
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:12,540
in the hierarchy. They can't grow higher

1957
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,540
in their local snowball system

1958
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,540
as a philosopher. You could

1959
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,540
at most become a Habeck-type.

1960
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,540
He's also a philosopher. Then you'll become a chancellor.

1961
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,540
Or...

1962
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,540
You just go around in some local

1963
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,540
universities and you're lucky and get a job.

1964
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:28,540
But it's clear that it doesn't work with

1965
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,540
everyone because there are way too many

1966
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,540
graduates and way too few

1967
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,540
applications for people like that.

1968
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,540
You just have to do something else.

1969
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,540
Of course you can say, I'm a writer

1970
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,540
and a web designer and a philosopher

1971
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:42,540
academically. You've got a paper on it

1972
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:44,540
and I've studied something and I'm doing something completely different.

1973
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:46,540
That works. I'm also a physicist and I could

1974
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:48,540
apply for everything. I could

1975
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:50,540
become a consultant

1976
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,540
or I could do something.

1977
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:54,540
I could become a software representative.

1978
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,540
I could write offers

1979
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,540
or sell something

1980
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,540
or something like that. You could do

1981
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,540
everything. But as a

1982
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,540
philosopher

1983
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:06,540
it's difficult to do something like that.

1984
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,540
Hatred on money-elite

1985
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,540
phyre KIZ

1986
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,540
I eat rich.

1987
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,540
A Christmas story

1988
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:30,540
and the chocolate factory.

1989
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,540
Is a Christmas story

1990
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,540
some kind of family story

1991
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:36,540
with these weird shit amis?

1992
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,540
Could be.

1993
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:44,540
Corona, however,

1994
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,540
holds the record of the most

1995
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:48,540
devoured brain areas.

1996
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,540
I don't know. I would say

1997
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:52,540
alcohol is quite good.

1998
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,540
And of course the normal

1999
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,540
Infotainment mainstream.

2000
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,540
But it also destroys a lot of brain areas.

2001
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,540
Especially with the children

2002
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,540
that are growing up now.

2003
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:04,540
If you grow up with two years

2004
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,540
with a screen in front of your face

2005
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,540
then you are too much

2006
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,540
in your head with ten.

2007
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:12,540
Nothing can develop cognitively.

2008
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,540
Techno comes from Germany.

2009
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,540
Sven Wett.

2010
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:22,540
The engineer

2011
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,540
is not so difficult.

2012
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,540
Okay, I'll write that down for later.

2013
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,540
Then I have it somewhere else.

2014
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,540
You never know.

2015
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,540
Marosha Blümchen

2016
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:44,540
Okay, yes, I remember.

2017
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,540
Blümchen was hardcore techno, right?

2018
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:48,540
It was really upda upda.

2019
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,540
Like a boom boom boom boom boom

2020
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,540
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

2021
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,540
Yes, that's right. That was funny.

2022
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,540
But rather Gawa. Yes, definitely

2023
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,540
I am fully involved. If already, then already.

2024
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:00,540
What comes to my mind

2025
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,540
is Rotterdamer Terror Corpse.

2026
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:04,540
Does anyone know that?

2027
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:06,540
That was really hardcore in my opinion.

2028
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,540
But that has to be like that

2029
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,540
in the direction, right?

2030
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:14,540
The university generation

2031
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,540
Student course.

2032
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,540
Which generation do you mean?

2033
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,540
This university generation.

2034
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,540
Well, he obviously means those who are currently studying.

2035
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,540
Right now, at this moment.

2036
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:30,540
So all those who were

2037
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,540
matriculated at the latest

2038
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:34,540
five years ago

2039
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,540
or are currently matriculated.

2040
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,540
Function theory for every analysis

2041
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,540
I'm doing right now and I find it mega exciting.

2042
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,540
I also want to apply

2043
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,540
and wanted to be an inventor since my childhood.

2044
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,540
Yes, that's definitely a cool setting.

2045
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,540
Then I wish you

2046
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:50,540
that you find a good professor

2047
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,540
with whom you can write

2048
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,540
real final work.

2049
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:56,540
I have the impression that this is a huge problem.

2050
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,540
Due to this massive alienation, people

2051
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,540
no longer want to go out on serious topics

2052
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,540
and struggle with teaching.

2053
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,540
But if you find something cool there

2054
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,540
maybe in a company with an application

2055
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,540
that is often possible with engineers

2056
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,540
that you go to a company for which you work

2057
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,540
they benefit from it.

2058
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,540
You write a work about it. The professor is happy.

2059
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:16,540
It has something to do with applications.

2060
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,540
It is something unique. It is a real project

2061
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,540
because it is unique and can not be repeated.

2062
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,540
If you have fun with it, it is great.

2063
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:24,540
The gain of knowledge is maximum

2064
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,540
because you can apply your mathematical knowledge.

2065
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,540
Morph. What does it look like

2066
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,540
with group talking?

2067
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,540
That is brown and knocks against

2068
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,540
what is brown and knocks against the glass?

2069
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,540
I do not know.

2070
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:46,540
When I shit on your mother's face

2071
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,540
she then knocks against my glass

2072
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,540
and asks herself

2073
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,540
why did you do that?

2074
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,540
Techno is not mine at all.

2075
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,540
I do not know anything about it.

2076
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:14,540
This is a rich man with the three ghosts.

2077
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,540
This is Ebenezer Scrooge.

2078
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:22,540
Ebenezer Scrooge.

2079
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,540
Then I arrived down here.

2080
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:26,540
Then we can continue in the list.

2081
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:28,540
Next film.

2082
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:30,540
I just saw it. It is called Eye for Eye.

2083
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,540
Christian Bale main role

2084
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,540
and a lot of other great actors.

2085
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,540
The film is full of great actors

2086
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:38,540
such as Woody Harrelson

2087
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,540
aka natural born killers

2088
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:42,540
or

2089
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,540
Forest Whitaker

2090
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:46,540
and super cool film.

2091
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,540
The film is so cool

2092
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:52,540
because he

2093
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,540
tells the story

2094
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:58,540
a bit like Good Times

2095
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,540
on this lower income layer.

2096
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:04,540
Christian Bale is a worker

2097
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,540
in a steel factory.

2098
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,540
His father is just dying

2099
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,540
because of the impacts

2100
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,540
that he has had on the dams

2101
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:14,540
during his life in the steel factory.

2102
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,540
This is the context.

2103
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:18,540
He has to work

2104
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,540
to get over the rounds.

2105
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:22,540
The metal factory

2106
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:24,540
that he works in is going to be closed.

2107
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,540
It is like a robot.

2108
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,540
There was prosperity

2109
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:30,540
but it is gone now.

2110
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,540
Everywhere everything is dirty.

2111
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,540
Everything is shit and dirty.

2112
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:36,540
I also stand on it.

2113
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:38,540
I stand on it when everything is dirty.

2114
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,540
When I was in Istanbul

2115
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:42,540
it was great.

2116
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,540
I stood on it because everything was dirty.

2117
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:46,540
I walked around with my wife in Peking.

2118
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,540
Everything was dirty.

2119
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,540
I stand on the big cities that are dirty.

2120
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,540
When it is dirty and shit

2121
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,540
you feel that there are still people

2122
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,540
who have a struggle

2123
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:58,540
and know how shitty life is.

2124
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,540
I feel much better

2125
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,540
when you sit in a bar

2126
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:04,540
and eat the rotten fries

2127
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:06,540
and see how people live there.

2128
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,540
I think that is much more authentic

2129
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:10,540
and you still feel life.

2130
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:12,540
It is not like in Singapore

2131
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,540
or Dubai where everything is clean

2132
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:16,540
and clean.

2133
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,540
We are in the upper 10%

2134
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:20,540
of the pyramid.

2135
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,540
Everything is fine here.

2136
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:24,540
You notice this difference

2137
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,540
when you are somewhere.

2138
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,540
This difference is clear

2139
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,540
in this movie.

2140
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,540
Everything is dirty.

2141
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,540
Christian Bale is a nice boy.

2142
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,540
He is being sold.

2143
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,540
He is being portrayed as a nice protagonist.

2144
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:40,540
He is an honorable man.

2145
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:42,540
He doesn't let himself be blamed.

2146
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,540
He works honestly for his money.

2147
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:46,540
He has this attitude.

2148
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,540
He goes hunting.

2149
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:50,540
But he doesn't kill the deer

2150
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:52,540
because he doesn't like it.

2151
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,540
He did that with the rifle.

2152
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,540
But then he thinks he doesn't need to shoot.

2153
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:58,540
He doesn't care.

2154
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:00,540
You notice that Christian Bale

2155
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,540
is a nice character.

2156
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:04,540
He is being portrayed.

2157
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,540
You have to think about

2158
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,540
what kind of a dude he is.

2159
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,540
He is not an aggro guy.

2160
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:12,540
But he knows how to defend himself

2161
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,540
against the fun he has.

2162
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:16,540
Everything is great.

2163
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,540
Then something happens.

2164
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,540
He drives

2165
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:22,540
along a street

2166
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:24,540
and there is a bad exit.

2167
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,540
Someone hits a car.

2168
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,540
He kills a child

2169
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,540
or a mother, I don't know.

2170
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,540
He kills two people.

2171
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:34,540
That's why he goes to jail.

2172
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,540
Then his life breaks.

2173
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,540
In the USA it is always on fire.

2174
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,540
If you can't work for a month

2175
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,540
everything goes bad.

2176
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:44,540
No money, your wife disappears.

2177
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,540
He goes to jail.

2178
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,540
His wife disappears.

2179
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,540
His father dies by accident.

2180
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,540
His brother

2181
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,540
goes on the wrong track.

2182
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:56,540
His brother has a similar problem.

2183
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:58,540
He is poor, but he doesn't want to work in the steelworks.

2184
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,540
What does he do?

2185
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:02,540
He goes to the army.

2186
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:04,540
That's the American dream.

2187
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:06,540
Sell your life.

2188
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,540
He goes to the army.

2189
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:10,540
He is four times in Iraq.

2190
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,540
He is traumatized.

2191
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:14,540
He has post-traumatic stress disorder.

2192
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,540
He is really bad.

2193
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,540
The only thing he can do

2194
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:20,540
when he comes back

2195
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:22,540
is to call himself a prostitute.

2196
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,540
But you don't call it that.

2197
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:26,540
You call it that.

2198
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,540
You do cage fights.

2199
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,540
You fight with other boys.

2200
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,540
Then you go to sports.

2201
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,540
There are fighters who beat you to death.

2202
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,540
It doesn't matter.

2203
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,540
Illegal fights.

2204
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,540
Same thing as prostitution

2205
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,540
on the male-male level.

2206
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:46,540
The nice thing about the movie

2207
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:48,540
is that it is there again.

2208
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:52,540
It is presented as it is.

2209
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,540
Everyone in this movie

2210
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:56,540
no matter if they are

2211
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,540
at the top of the hierarchy

2212
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:00,540
they all have an unhappy life.

2213
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:02,540
They all lead an unhappy life.

2214
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:04,540
None of them can claim

2215
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,540
that he is good at it.

2216
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:08,540
Even Woody Harrelson

2217
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:10,540
who is the craziest boy

2218
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:12,540
of all these motherfuckers

2219
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:14,540
who leads the freest life of all.

2220
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,540
Even he is permanently

2221
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:18,540
dissatisfied and pisses.

2222
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:20,540
He has to take drugs all the time

2223
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,540
because everything around him

2224
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,540
is disgusting and disgusting.

2225
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,540
And he himself is disgusting and disgusting.

2226
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,540
And that's just great.

2227
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:30,540
The movie is there again.

2228
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,540
That's a movie where I say

2229
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:34,540
yes, wonderful.

2230
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:36,540
He puts his finger right in the wound.

2231
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,540
How shitty the world is

2232
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:40,540
especially over there in the American dream.

2233
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:42,540
I don't even know where it is.

2234
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,540
I think it's said Michigan or something.

2235
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:48,540
There must be exactly the situation

2236
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:50,540
when the baby boomers were there

2237
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,540
and you could work hard for your

2238
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,540
life and so on.

2239
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,540
And now all the factories are closing

2240
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,540
and he also says in between

2241
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:00,540
because it's cheaper in China to buy steel

2242
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:02,540
than to produce it here.

2243
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,540
And what always strikes me

2244
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:06,540
when I see a movie like this

2245
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:08,540
that is now on the topic

2246
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,540
is this debate

2247
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,540
that is currently being led here

2248
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:14,540
with the windmills because

2249
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,540
they pollute our landscape.

2250
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:18,540
That's super ridiculous.

2251
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:20,540
Fuck the landscape.

2252
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,540
There's a windmill.

2253
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,540
Do you have a problem that you can't

2254
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:26,540
draw a picture because it doesn't

2255
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:28,540
look like it was 100 years ago?

2256
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:30,540
Our world is changing

2257
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,540
and we as humans are changing our world.

2258
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,540
That's nothing new.

2259
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:36,540
And to put windmills there

2260
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:38,540
is a weakness because of aesthetics.

2261
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:40,540
I never understood that.

2262
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:42,540
But the normal industrialization

2263
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:44,540
makes it out of itself anyway.

2264
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,540
In the middle of nature, there's a

2265
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:48,540
super cool valley, there are mountains,

2266
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:50,540
everything could be super nice, but everywhere

2267
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,540
are some rails laid, some

2268
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,540
cobblestones, everything is super

2269
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:56,540
dirty, everything is some kind of fleece bands,

2270
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,540
everything looks shit, there's some metal

2271
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:00,540
scrap lying around everywhere, some shitty

2272
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:02,540
cars that are no longer driven and so on.

2273
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,540
And that is the normal degree

2274
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,540
of pollution that capitalism

2275
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:08,540
favors with our environment and our

2276
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,540
nature. So talking about aesthetics

2277
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:12,540
doesn't take place anyway and

2278
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,540
that's a good point.

2279
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,540
And of course,

2280
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:18,540
it's a revenge movie and I'm

2281
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,540
totally against revenge movies because

2282
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,540
it takes away my lowest instincts.

2283
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,540
Just because, of course,

2284
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,540
Christian Bale's brother

2285
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,540
is being killed

2286
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:30,540
by Woody Harrelson because he's a

2287
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,540
stupid mafia wanker who says

2288
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,540
you owe me and I'll kill you all.

2289
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:36,540
And Woody Harrelson is generally

2290
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:38,540
a crazy dude who kills everyone

2291
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,540
he doesn't want to kill anymore.

2292
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:42,540
Well, and Christian Bale

2293
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:44,540
is a calm guy all the time

2294
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,540
but he has

2295
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,540
enough of it and

2296
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:50,540
now he has to go through it

2297
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:52,540
and he just makes him cold.

2298
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:54,540
And that's a nice

2299
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:56,540
story. It's just a nice

2300
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,540
story about the

2301
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:00,540
situation that you actually ask yourself

2302
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,540
what kind of choice do people have

2303
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:04,540
who are still living there?

2304
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:06,540
In what kind of world were they born

2305
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,540
there? And that's the first world.

2306
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:10,540
There you should actually say

2307
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:12,540
okay, there should actually be a

2308
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:14,540
solidarity community that makes sure

2309
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,540
that people can become something else

2310
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:18,540
apart from steel workers and drug dealers.

2311
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,540
But that's being shown there

2312
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,540
because the other option, the alternative

2313
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:24,540
is to become a policeman and the drug

2314
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,540
dealers and other spas just chase them.

2315
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,540
What is not shown

2316
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:30,540
is, so to speak, you could go to a

2317
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:32,540
university or something, but that just doesn't exist because

2318
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:34,540
it's somewhere in the province. And of course

2319
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:36,540
everyone has this rotten idea

2320
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,540
of homeland love and patriotism

2321
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,540
and work honestly

2322
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:42,540
for your money and all this

2323
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,540
work fetish that is being

2324
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:46,540
poured into these Americans.

2325
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:48,540
All these contradictions

2326
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,540
are well represented in the film.

2327
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:52,540
Even if the film doesn't directly

2328
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:54,540
address it. And that's why

2329
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:56,540
I would say it's a good film about capitalism.

2330
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:08,540
Hmm...

2331
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:12,540
Yes, his beard already has a beard.

2332
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:16,540
You're talking about some insiders, aren't you?

2333
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:18,540
I can't start anything with them.

2334
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,540
I'm still in elementary school,

2335
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,540
so I still have a little bit

2336
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:24,540
ahead of me, but I

2337
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,540
will remember your words

2338
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,540
and will look after a

2339
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:30,540
good professional or a good

2340
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:32,540
business. Yes, that

2341
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:34,540
definitely has to be the case.

2342
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,540
For the engineers, this is very important.

2343
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,540
I would even say that

2344
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,540
this is the most important thing.

2345
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:42,540
That's where you make the most experience.

2346
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,540
Because

2347
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:46,540
especially in engineering studies

2348
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:48,540
I've always had the impression that

2349
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:50,540
the teaching...

2350
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:52,540
Okay,

2351
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,540
that can also be different from

2352
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,540
university to university.

2353
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:58,540
It's probably better if you're at

2354
01:48:58,540 --> 01:49:00,540
Humboldt University or Erlangen than

2355
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,540
if you're at a provincial university.

2356
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:04,540
But still, especially because the

2357
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:06,540
engineering studies are

2358
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,540
related to their practice,

2359
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:10,540
this is of course important.

2360
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:12,540
And

2361
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,540
among us, you learn the most.

2362
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:16,540
That's the only

2363
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,540
time that you're really

2364
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,540
self-reliant and have to solve problems.

2365
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:22,540
At least that would be the best.

2366
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:24,540
That's the ideal case. You get a problem

2367
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:26,540
that is so moderated that you can

2368
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:28,540
create it yourself and then

2369
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:30,540
solve it with mathematics.

2370
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,540
For example,

2371
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:34,540
I had a friend who was

2372
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:36,540
in the university for a long time and

2373
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:38,540
then studied electrical engineering.

2374
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:40,540
He's in the same situation now.

2375
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:42,540
He's just doing that now

2376
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,540
at companies.

2377
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,540
And he's really getting into it.

2378
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:48,540
I have the impression that

2379
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,540
it's definitely much better than

2380
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:52,540
studying 08.15 and then

2381
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:54,540
writing a good bachelor's degree.

2382
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:56,540
Because I've seen that too.

2383
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:58,540
I see a lot of engineers

2384
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:00,540
who are of course completely alienated.

2385
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:02,540
And I can't tell anyone that they're doing a good job afterwards.

2386
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,540
They will only do a good job somewhere later.

2387
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:06,540
You know, they will do this experience

2388
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,540
at most, if they're lucky,

2389
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,540
after graduation. But you should actually

2390
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,540
do that in your studies. You should experience it in your studies

2391
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,540
alone to know

2392
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:16,540
if that's actually something for you.

2393
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,540
That's a kind of fireball.

2394
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,540
And that's what belongs in an education.

2395
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:22,540
So that afterwards someone comes out

2396
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,540
who can really

2397
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:26,540
go into a room

2398
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:28,540
and say, hey,

2399
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,540
I'm the crazy boy.

2400
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,540
I can solve these problems.

2401
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:34,540
You're the management guys.

2402
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,540
You're the guy with the PR.

2403
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,540
You're the one who's the operator

2404
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:40,540
and calculates the numbers.

2405
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:42,540
But I'm doing the content here.

2406
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,540
I'm taking care of the content.

2407
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:46,540
That's what the engineer should be able to do.

2408
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:48,540
And I have the impression that

2409
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,540
there are far too few people

2410
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:52,540
who can still do that

2411
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:54,540
after graduation.

2412
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:56,540
But that's the way it is. And now in my

2413
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:58,540
support I see that quite often.

2414
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:00,540
I have about 50-50 students,

2415
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:02,540
50% students and 50% people

2416
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:04,540
who are at the university.

2417
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:06,540
And what can I say?

2418
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,540
They're almost all engineers, of course.

2419
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,540
I don't do math

2420
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:12,540
because I can't do that

2421
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,540
with the proofs and the words

2422
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,540
and the vocabulary, because I'm not a mathematician myself.

2423
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:18,540
Only very rarely can I help with that.

2424
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:20,540
But otherwise

2425
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:22,540
they're almost all engineers.

2426
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:24,540
I also have some financial problems,

2427
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:26,540
but I don't want to talk about them to the engineers.

2428
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:40,540
Where did we end up?

2429
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,540
Next movie.

2430
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:44,540
The Drop Bargeld.

2431
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,540
That's what it's called in German.

2432
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:48,540
The Drop Bargeld.

2433
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:50,540
And I also saw the movie last time.

2434
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:52,540
First of all, it's with Tom Hardy.

2435
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:54,540
That's great.

2436
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,540
He's with the guy from

2437
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:58,540
Sopranos.

2438
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,540
I think that's the same guy.

2439
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:08,540
The movie is also

2440
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:10,540
almost a

2441
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,540
horror thriller, but

2442
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,540
very different.

2443
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:16,540
Tom Hardy

2444
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,540
is the main character

2445
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,540
and he lives in a city

2446
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,540
and he works as a waiter.

2447
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:24,540
He does a very

2448
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:26,540
simple job.

2449
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,540
And he doesn't want to have anything to do

2450
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:30,540
with the mafia,

2451
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:32,540
which is everywhere.

2452
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:34,540
And you notice all the time

2453
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:36,540
that he is

2454
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:38,540
someone who

2455
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:40,540
doesn't want to have anything to do with them,

2456
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:42,540
but doesn't have a problem

2457
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:44,540
with it

2458
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:46,540
if he gets pissed,

2459
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:48,540
that he could

2460
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:50,540
somehow finish the people.

2461
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,540
But he doesn't do it.

2462
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:54,540
He leaves it all behind.

2463
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,540
He doesn't try to have any interaction

2464
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,540
with this parallel world,

2465
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:00,540
he just wants to earn money

2466
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:02,540
and live, and he doesn't know

2467
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,540
what he wants to do.

2468
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,540
You have this feeling that he's up to something,

2469
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:08,540
but it's not said if he's up to something

2470
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:10,540
or if he doesn't know what he wants to do,

2471
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:12,540
but you are thrown into this setting.

2472
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:14,540
And then one day

2473
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:16,540
a dog in a trash can

2474
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:18,540
which wasn't meant for him

2475
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:20,540
turns out to be

2476
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:22,540
a complicated method

2477
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:24,540
of making a psycho into a troller.

2478
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,540
But he gets involved

2479
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:28,540
in the story of a psycho

2480
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,540
who wants to become a troller

2481
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:32,540
and he falls in love with the troller

2482
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:34,540
or the troller falls in love with him

2483
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:36,540
and then there is an interaction

2484
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:38,540
and the guy is a psycho

2485
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:40,540
and a criminal and he

2486
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:42,540
threatens everyone with death.

2487
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:44,540
And it's like this,

2488
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:48,540
the guy who owns the bar

2489
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:50,540
in which he works,

2490
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,540
he has weird things going on

2491
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:54,540
and the bar is always used

2492
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:56,540
as a drop.

2493
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,540
That means the mafia boys

2494
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,540
somehow store money

2495
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:02,540
between them in the evening

2496
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:04,540
and then get it a few hours later.

2497
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:06,540
So that some of the suppliers

2498
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:08,540
drop the money they made

2499
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:10,540
through their drug sales

2500
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:12,540
and then someone else comes

2501
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,540
and takes it away.

2502
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:16,540
That's the model.

2503
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:18,540
I don't know if he gets some profit

2504
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:20,540
or if it's just money.

2505
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:22,540
Anyway, this film lives in this world

2506
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,540
and it's a side-effect

2507
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,540
an interesting side-effect

2508
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:28,540
because it changes things a little bit.

2509
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:30,540
The guy tries

2510
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:32,540
to trick the mafia

2511
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,540
and you know it's a bad idea

2512
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:36,540
and they really kick you out.

2513
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,540
The boy gets really pissed

2514
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:40,540
and it's a little bit Romanian

2515
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:42,540
and it's also represented a little bit

2516
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:44,540
and a little bit of everyday racism

2517
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,540
is also put in there, that's all funny.

2518
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:48,540
My cat is barking, I'll get her in.

2519
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:02,540
The nice thing about this film is

2520
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:04,540
Tom Hardy is,

2521
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:06,540
we all know him,

2522
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,540
he's the coolest Pumperboy

2523
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,540
who could destroy everyone in the world

2524
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:12,540
if he wanted to.

2525
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:14,540
And you think all the time,

2526
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:16,540
but that's Tom Hardy, why doesn't he destroy him?

2527
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,540
But he doesn't.

2528
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,540
He's a very chill, very chill boy.

2529
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,540
At the end of the film

2530
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:26,540
there's a conflict

2531
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:28,540
over a

2532
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:30,540
masculine

2533
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:32,540
boy-legend story

2534
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:34,540
that represents

2535
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:36,540
a big lie

2536
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:38,540
and he knows it all the time

2537
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:40,540
but he plays along

2538
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:42,540
because he really doesn't want

2539
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,540
to have anything to do with it.

2540
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:46,540
And the story comes out

2541
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:48,540
that if he has to

2542
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,540
and is forced to,

2543
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:52,540
he pulls it through and makes people cold.

2544
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:54,540
But you're not playing with the shit

2545
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,540
that's lying on the floor, are you?

2546
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:06,540
The cat gets annoyed,

2547
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:08,540
comes in

2548
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:10,540
and then gets annoyed on the floor.

2549
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,540
I like that.

2550
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:14,540
Anyway, Tom Hardy

2551
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:16,540
turns out to be a really cool motherfucker

2552
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:18,540
at the end of the film,

2553
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:20,540
makes him cold, takes the princess with him

2554
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:22,540
and happy end.

2555
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:24,540
That's basically the story.

2556
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:26,540
And the cool thing is,

2557
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:28,540
all the time there's a bully

2558
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:30,540
that he knows from church

2559
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:32,540
and he also has a funny role

2560
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,540
but he can't do anything.

2561
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:36,540
He can only look at these mafia structures

2562
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:38,540
and somehow

2563
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:40,540
don't really intervene

2564
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:42,540
because it's clear, the bullies are powerless.

2565
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:44,540
And in the end, the bully

2566
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:46,540
also gives him the props

2567
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:48,540
because you're a really cool boy.

2568
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,540
And Tom Hardy of course doesn't say anything about it.

2569
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,540
And it's just

2570
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:54,540
all these structures

2571
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,540
and also how the business runs

2572
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:58,540
because mafia is of course also just a business.

2573
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:00,540
It shows how these two parallel worlds work

2574
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,540
and that's often the case

2575
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:04,540
in these gangster films.

2576
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:06,540
That you have these parallel worlds

2577
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:08,540
where you have this bully world

2578
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:10,540
that somehow does the legal way

2579
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:12,540
and there are also business models

2580
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,540
included and there's corruption too.

2581
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:16,540
And then there's the complete

2582
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:18,540
illegality where

2583
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,540
mafia structures work exactly

2584
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:22,540
according to the same scheme.

2585
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:24,540
The snowball system is always the same,

2586
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,540
you always have the same hierarchies,

2587
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:28,540
they're just called differently,

2588
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:30,540
and then it's corrupt and

2589
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,540
there's something going on and so on.

2590
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:34,540
It's always like that.

2591
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,540
It's always done like that.

2592
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,540
And that's why I think this film

2593
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:40,540
is so cool and that's why it talks about

2594
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,540
capitalism because

2595
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:44,540
with the existence

2596
01:57:44,540 --> 01:57:46,540
of these people

2597
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:48,540
it shows them,

2598
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,540
it shows how they live there

2599
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:52,540
under what conditions they live there

2600
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:54,540
and also

2601
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,540
people like

2602
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:58,540
Tom Hardy

2603
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:00,540
can develop their own morals

2604
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:02,540
or a codex

2605
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:04,540
according to which they can live.

2606
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:06,540
Life has made them tough, but they still have

2607
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:08,540
a moral codex. And many don't have that.

2608
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,540
You have to imagine

2609
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,540
Tom Hardy is absolutely

2610
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,540
unique in how he's

2611
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,540
portrayed because a normal person

2612
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:18,540
wouldn't behave like that. A normal person

2613
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:20,540
would have given up much earlier and would have been

2614
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:22,540
crushed. Tom Hardy is

2615
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:24,540
portrayed as someone who has

2616
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,540
a very high resilience,

2617
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:28,540
a very high character strength

2618
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:30,540
compared to this external

2619
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,540
influence and

2620
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:36,540
influence, so to speak, that

2621
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:38,540
influence him.

2622
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:40,540
And that shows how difficult it is,

2623
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:42,540
how difficult it is to grow up there and to act like that

2624
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:44,540
and to become an upright citizen or

2625
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:46,540
to do something great.

2626
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:48,540
What's going on with the cat? It's completely

2627
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:50,540
rusting out here, isn't it? It can't be crazy.

2628
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,540
What's going on?

2629
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:54,540
Emmy?

2630
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:58,540
Where are you?

2631
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:02,540
Do you want to get out?

2632
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:14,540
Yes, Departed is also a movie, of course.

2633
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:16,540
By the way, Departed is

2634
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:18,540
a remake. You should all know that.

2635
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:20,540
The original

2636
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:22,540
movie is called Internal Fias

2637
01:59:22,540 --> 01:59:24,540
and has more than one part.

2638
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:26,540
And we all

2639
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:28,540
got into it really well.

2640
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:30,540
And Departed is really

2641
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:32,540
copied one by one. It's a real,

2642
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,540
real remake for the American market.

2643
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,540
Because of casualization.

2644
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,540
The people in the mainstream can't take

2645
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:40,540
these Asian faces off. They can't.

2646
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:42,540
Asian movies can't watch them,

2647
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:44,540
can they? They have a different

2648
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:46,540
gestic, they have a different habitus.

2649
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:48,540
You can't sell that to people.

2650
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:50,540
And that's what Bo Jin Ho did

2651
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:52,540
really well with Snowpiercer, that he

2652
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,540
bought some Americans for it. Because

2653
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:56,540
otherwise he could never have such a success

2654
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:58,540
with the movie. With Snowpiercer.

2655
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,540
Because of this wickedness.

2656
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:02,540
People can't do that.

2657
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:04,540
I mean, people can't watch

2658
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:06,540
German or French or Spanish

2659
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,540
productions in peace. They get

2660
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:10,540
a scratch somehow. And for the American market

2661
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:12,540
it's not even there. They have to

2662
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:14,540
remake everything again.

2663
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:16,540
And Departed is one of these remakes

2664
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:18,540
where everyone says, this is such a cool movie.

2665
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:20,540
But fuck you, dude. It's just a Korean movie.

2666
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:22,540
I think it's Korean.

2667
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:26,540
Infernal Envy, definitely.

2668
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:28,540
And as I said, not even that bad.

2669
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,540
Not even that bad.

2670
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:32,540
You know.

2671
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:34,540
And where we're already at, Asian movies.

2672
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:40,540
I Saw the Devil. Super movie.

2673
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:42,540
Then of course

2674
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,540
Oldboy. Of course it also has an American

2675
02:00:44,540 --> 02:00:46,540
remake by now.

2676
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,540
Oldboy. Super strong movie.

2677
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,540
And what did we see last time?

2678
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:52,540
A really cool movie. I think

2679
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:54,540
The Audition.

2680
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:56,540
Or

2681
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:58,540
Geständnisse. I still find that out.

2682
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:00,540
I still find that out.

2683
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:02,540
I quickly check

2684
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:04,540
the movie pilots.

2685
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:06,540
I quickly find that out.

2686
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:08,540
I just have to look at the first page.

2687
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:10,540
They are all very well rated by me.

2688
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:12,540
So, and

2689
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:14,540
So, and

2690
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:16,540
So, what did I have already?

2691
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:18,540
I Saw the Devil

2692
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:20,540
I Saw the Devil already.

2693
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:22,540
Then

2694
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:24,540
Oldboy, I already said that.

2695
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:26,540
Oldboy, I already said that.

2696
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:42,540
Infernal Enviers

2697
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:44,540
Infernal Enviers

2698
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:46,540
Infernal Enviers has a 9.5

2699
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:48,540
Infernal Enviers has a 9.5

2700
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:50,540
Departed also has a 9.5

2701
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:52,540
I see that Departed is

2702
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:54,540
USA and Hong Kong.

2703
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:56,540
That means the Chinese

2704
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,540
added Hitler.

2705
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:00,540
They added some money to it.

2706
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:02,540
Adaption? No, that's not it.

2707
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:04,540
What does the movie

2708
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:06,540
Confessions

2709
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,540
Confessions mean?

2710
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:10,540
So

2711
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:16,540
Confessions

2712
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:36,540
Oh no

2713
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:38,540
What is it?

2714
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:44,540
I think it's called Audition.

2715
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:46,540
The movie was

2716
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:48,540
really nice.

2717
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:52,540
This is an Asian movie from Japan.

2718
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:54,540
I really liked it.

2719
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:56,540
Is that the one

2720
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:58,540
where the

2721
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:00,540
movie

2722
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,540
movie

2723
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:04,540
movie

2724
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:06,540
movie

2725
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:08,540
movie

2726
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:10,540
movie

2727
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:12,540
nice but it's not the one

2728
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:14,540
I mean

2729
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:16,540
Woman, tell me if you are still

2730
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:18,540
online. What was the name

2731
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,540
of the movie where the teacher

2732
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:22,540
claims she infected everyone with AIDS?

2733
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:26,540
What was the name?

2734
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:29,540
I thought it was called Confession.

2735
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:34,540
I have to search again.

2736
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:42,540
I think it was from Japan.

2737
02:03:56,540 --> 02:04:07,540
No, that's not what it's called. I can't remember.

2738
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:11,540
I can't see it in my history.

2739
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,540
The problem is, it's not compatible.

2740
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:18,540
Sometimes I didn't rate the movies.

2741
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:22,540
And then they're just gone.

2742
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:27,540
Then they disappeared in the Nirvana of Bits and Bytes.

2743
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:30,540
The movies.

2744
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:34,540
What was it called? It can't be.

2745
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:38,540
It was a Japanese movie.

2746
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:41,540
I'm just going to google it now.

2747
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:44,540
Japanese movie.

2748
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:47,540
Woman puts on AIDS.

2749
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:51,540
And then somehow confessions.

2750
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:52,540
Right.

2751
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:57,540
Japanese. The movie is called German title. Confessions from 2010.

2752
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:01,540
And then I just searched for it. Confessions or what?

2753
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:04,540
It can't be or what?

2754
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,540
So.

2755
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:10,540
It comes right into the list.

2756
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:12,540
Confessions.

2757
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:15,540
No, no, it's not called Confessions. It's called...

2758
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:16,540
Fuck.

2759
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:20,540
It's called Confessions. Original title. Koku Haku.

2760
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:23,540
This movie is really awesome.

2761
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:27,540
I liked it. I gave it a new one. I just didn't find it.

2762
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:29,540
Confessions.

2763
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:32,540
No, it doesn't belong in the list.

2764
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:34,540
Because it's not a film about capitalism.

2765
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:36,540
I just wanted to show Asian movies.

2766
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:41,540
This movie is awesome. You can give it a try.

2767
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:44,540
So.

2768
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:46,540
And now...

2769
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:48,540
Where did we stop? White Drop.

2770
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:50,540
Okay, I told you Tom Hardy.

2771
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:53,540
Next movie. Sorry to Bother You. I already told you about it.

2772
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:56,540
It's basically...

2773
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:58,540
Yeah.

2774
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:00,540
You have to watch it.

2775
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:04,540
It's a must-see like The Big Short and The Big Crash.

2776
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:06,540
It's a little bit funnier.

2777
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:12,540
But it has a lot more parts of the snowball system and capitalism than the others.

2778
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:17,540
It starts with Call Center and ends with the absolute creation of life.

2779
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:24,540
I think I talked about it in my video about mass animal husbandry and the exploitation of life through capitalism.

2780
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:30,540
I think that's what I'm talking about because it's exactly in this direction. Human capital and so on.

2781
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:32,540
So what else do I have here? The shaft.

2782
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:35,540
Well, I made an English video about the shaft.

2783
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:41,540
For me, the nice thing about the shaft is that this thing with the Monte Carlo simulation

2784
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:50,540
and the markets or, let's say, with the solution, with the spontaneous solidarity, is well represented.

2785
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:54,540
You could still discuss whether it's about capitalism or socialism.

2786
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:58,540
But that doesn't matter. It's about hierarchies.

2787
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:02,540
And of course I would like to say that it's essentially about capitalism.

2788
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:05,540
The film is critical of capitalism.

2789
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:07,540
But you don't have to...

2790
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:14,540
It's basically about hierarchy criticism and how a society is built up in a world

2791
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:17,540
in which you can only imagine that there must be hierarchies.

2792
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:22,540
And whether you call it capitalism or socialism doesn't matter.

2793
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:25,540
I think that's well represented in the film.

2794
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:27,540
And of course it has a lot of funny aspects.

2795
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:30,540
I made a long English video about it, about 20 minutes or so.

2796
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:35,540
If you can stand my English, you can give it to me because it's really disgusting.

2797
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:37,540
But I don't want to talk about it anymore.

2798
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:42,540
It's completely clear that this is a film that belongs in such a list.

2799
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:43,540
The next film.

2800
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:44,540
Rampage 2.

2801
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:46,540
Capital punishment.

2802
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:48,540
I think all Rampage parts are great.

2803
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:51,540
They are by Uwe Boll and they are fantastic.

2804
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:53,540
The films are really just wonderful.

2805
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:54,540
I totally agree.

2806
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:59,540
And Rampage 2 is just super awesome because it's really about capitalism

2807
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:03,540
and how he wants to really destroy the establishment.

2808
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:04,540
And it's just awesome.

2809
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:06,540
And I think Uwe Boll also plays himself.

2810
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:10,540
Or he plays some other film maker.

2811
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:12,540
And it's just ...

2812
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:14,540
Ah yes.

2813
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:17,540
So of course you can guess Uwe Boll and hate him as you want.

2814
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:19,540
But I think this film is really awesome.

2815
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,540
I'm just on it.

2816
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:22,540
The next film.

2817
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:24,540
Good bless America.

2818
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:26,540
Super awesome film.

2819
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:30,540
It's not directly about capitalism or something.

2820
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:32,540
But it's about ...

2821
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:40,540
... about media and about this fucked up American culture

2822
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:46,540
that at the end, after a hundred years, comes out of the people.

2823
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:48,540
A lot is being said about it.

2824
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:51,540
There is also this fetish that everyone always has to become younger.

2825
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:55,540
And that actually all are pedophiles because of their sexual ideals.

2826
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:57,540
Everyone wants to fuck a 14-year-old and so on.

2827
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:59,540
Everything is shown super well.

2828
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:03,540
That this whole cult and this whole beauty ideal is based on it.

2829
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:05,540
And ...

2830
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:11,540
I think in the end, they are in a talk show or in some evening show

2831
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,540
and ...

2832
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:14,540
... they bang their heads a little bit.

2833
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:16,540
That reminds a little bit of the end of Joker.

2834
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:20,540
But the film is also made a little funny at the beginning.

2835
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:22,540
But it's just ... it's just wonderful.

2836
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:25,540
It's for people who are latent,

2837
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:27,540
what they have against this capitalist use of logic

2838
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:31,540
and this stupid culture of stupidity.

2839
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:32,540
It's wonderful.

2840
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:34,540
So everyone who likes idiocacy

2841
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:37,540
has to see God Bless America.

2842
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:41,540
These films are not the same,

2843
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:44,540
but I have the impression that they belong together.

2844
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,540
So God Bless America.

2845
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:49,540
Super cool film. I can only recommend it.

2846
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:52,540
The next film on the list is known.

2847
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:53,540
The Wolf of Wall Street.

2848
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:55,540
I don't need to say anything about it.

2849
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,540
It's a great film.

2850
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:58,540
It's just fantastic.

2851
02:09:58,540 --> 02:09:59,540
Especially the end.

2852
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:02,540
The end is really premium.

2853
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:03,540
The whole film is premium.

2854
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,540
Don't get me wrong.

2855
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:05,540
The film is super cool.

2856
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:06,540
But the end.

2857
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:10,540
How he holds these workshops, these lectures

2858
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:11,540
with the pen.

2859
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,540
How do I sell the pen to people and so on.

2860
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:15,540
And the camera perspective.

2861
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:18,540
How the audience is filmed, so to speak.

2862
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:20,540
And how everyone actually goes down on these guys

2863
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:22,540
with the success and so on.

2864
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:23,540
That's great.

2865
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:25,540
The film has several layers of interpretation

2866
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:27,540
and they are all fantastic.

2867
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:29,540
Super cool film.

2868
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:31,540
I don't need to say anything more.

2869
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:33,540
Next film.

2870
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:35,540
Falling Down.

2871
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:36,540
A normal day.

2872
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:39,540
Now you ask yourself, what does it have to do with capitalism?

2873
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:41,540
The film is only about capitalism.

2874
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:47,540
Michael Douglas comes to a few stations of his life

2875
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,540
in the film.

2876
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:51,540
And again and again he asks questions.

2877
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:52,540
Why is it like this?

2878
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:53,540
Why is it like this?

2879
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:55,540
Why is it so shitty here?

2880
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:56,540
Why don't you do it like this?

2881
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,540
And the answer is always capitalism.

2882
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:59,540
But he doesn't see it.

2883
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:03,540
Because for a while he himself in this cold war

2884
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:06,540
in this ideology that the Americans are the best.

2885
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,540
And that he is a patriot.

2886
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:09,540
And that he would do everything for his country and so on.

2887
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:12,540
I think he also worked at the CIA as an engineer

2888
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:13,540
or something like that.

2889
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:15,540
And he sacrificed himself for his country.

2890
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:17,540
But no one gives a fuck about it.

2891
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,540
And in the end it's all a big joke.

2892
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:22,540
And of course he also has a huge psychosis.

2893
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:24,540
He beats his wife and everything is shit.

2894
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:25,540
And he is not understood.

2895
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:28,540
He doesn't feel valued.

2896
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:32,540
And there is this super cool scene

2897
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:34,540
also with the Nazi in this store.

2898
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:36,540
Where he says to the Nazi

2899
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:39,540
we are not friends and you are not an American.

2900
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:41,540
You are just an asshole.

2901
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:45,540
And that is a wonderful scene.

2902
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:50,540
Because he doesn't see himself that way.

2903
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:53,540
He doesn't see that he also behaves racistically.

2904
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:56,540
Or even better, that capitalism

2905
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:59,540
strengthens these racist tendencies.

2906
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:04,540
Whereas he himself is not racist.

2907
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:07,540
He also tells this Asian in the store

2908
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:09,540
that he is just a fucking faggot

2909
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:11,540
and that the coke is so expensive.

2910
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:13,540
And so he completely rages.

2911
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:16,540
And I don't even know how it was.

2912
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:20,540
But of course he throws some racist words at his head.

2913
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:22,540
But he just does that because

2914
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,540
he doesn't want to be in his culture

2915
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:26,540
because he is a racist.

2916
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:28,540
And the other guy is a real racist.

2917
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:30,540
And he also has something against whores.

2918
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:32,540
And he sits in his leather shop

2919
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:35,540
with the military stuff and the tank fist and so on.

2920
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,540
And all this nonsense.

2921
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:40,540
And then he clearly limits himself.

2922
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:42,540
And says, no, wait a minute, that's me.

2923
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:44,540
But I'm not. I'm a real American

2924
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:46,540
and we are really crazy here.

2925
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:48,540
We are the Americans, we don't need that.

2926
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:50,540
This whole film actually shows everyone

2927
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:52,540
all these contradictions of capitalism

2928
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:54,540
and above all this western culture

2929
02:12:54,540 --> 02:12:56,540
which was highly stylized there.

2930
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:58,540
Especially at the time, the film is already 20, 30 years old.

2931
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:00,540
It is shown super cool.

2932
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:02,540
And above all it is shown

2933
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,540
why the conservatives and the AFD

2934
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:06,540
why they are so to speak strong.

2935
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:08,540
Because people like Michael Douglas

2936
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:10,540
they don't see the problem.

2937
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:12,540
They only see symptoms.

2938
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:14,540
And Michael Douglas is not able

2939
02:13:14,540 --> 02:13:16,540
to do a system analysis.

2940
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:18,540
He goes over this golf course,

2941
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,540
he completely rubs off

2942
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:22,540
that these damn yuppie wankers

2943
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:24,540
No, they are not yuppies.

2944
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:26,540
No, they are some old rich sacks.

2945
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:28,540
It doesn't matter. He rubs off completely

2946
02:13:28,540 --> 02:13:30,540
that this is not a public park.

2947
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,540
You think, what is this supposed to be?

2948
02:13:32,540 --> 02:13:34,540
Why is there a fence around here?

2949
02:13:34,540 --> 02:13:36,540
What kind of wankers are you?

2950
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:38,540
This fence should be accessible to the public,

2951
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:40,540
this park should be accessible.

2952
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:42,540
And you are pissing yourselves off with your golf.

2953
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:44,540
This can't be true. Shit.

2954
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:46,540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

2955
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:48,540
And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

2956
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:50,540

2957

And he just doesn't see that capitalism is the problem.

3025
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:08,540
Oh, and by the way,

3026
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:10,540
now I remember another movie,

3027
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:12,540
which definitely has to be on the list.

3028
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:14,540
I, Daniel Blake, also has to be on the list.

3029
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:18,540
It's also an awful movie,

3030
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:20,540
we'll talk about that in a moment.

3031
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:24,540
Yes, and Michael Douglas.

3032
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:26,540
Yes, and Michael Douglas.

3033
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:28,540
It's just great.

3034
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:30,540
First of all, of course, great actor.

3035
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:32,540
And he fits in really well.

3036
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:34,540
And then the end with his daughter and so on.

3037
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:36,540
The bully.

3038
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,540
The bully who is always behind him.

3039
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:40,540
He is one day before the pension.

3040
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:42,540
He could just lie back and say

3041
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:44,540
fuck it, but no.

3042
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:46,540
He is an honest man.

3043
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:48,540
And his wife at home

3044
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:50,540
only makes him stress and he doesn't want to go home at all.

3045
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:52,540
That's why he would rather work.

3046
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:54,540
But he only has colleagues who piss him off

3047
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:56,540
and who don't follow him.

3048
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:58,540
He is the only one who takes his job seriously.

3049
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:00,540
And he is a really nice boy.

3050
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:02,540
Who just wants the best for everyone.

3051
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:04,540
And he gets really pissed off by the system.

3052
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:06,540
You notice that too.

3053
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:08,540
And that's so funny, because

3054
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:10,540
both protagonists, this old cracker,

3055
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:12,540
the bully and Michael Douglas,

3056
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,540
the old cracker

3057
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:16,540
could also have a bad day

3058
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:18,540
and completely freak out.

3059
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:20,540
And he is really just being fucked up

3060
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:22,540
on his job and he is also doing great shit.

3061
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:24,540
But he has the resilience

3062
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:26,540
and this goodwill.

3063
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:28,540
And Michael Douglas doesn't have that anymore.

3064
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:30,540
This is the dualism

3065
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:32,540
of these two people.

3066
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,540
How they meet at the end and talk about

3067
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:36,540
things they can't do.

3068
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:38,540
And then of course he beats him up.

3069
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:40,540
I think he beats him up at the end.

3070
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:42,540
And then the movie is over.

3071
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,540
And it's all super tragic.

3072
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:46,540
The movie is lovely.

3073
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:48,540
And in my opinion it's all about

3074
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:50,540
capitalism in the movie.

3075
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,540
So...

3076
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:04,540
What are the boys writing here?

3077
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:12,540
The question is, how do I recognize

3078
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:14,540
a good prof, what is a good topic

3079
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:16,540
for the final work. Yes, that is difficult of course.

3080
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:18,540
So you should first

3081
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:20,540
go after whether the topic

3082
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:22,540
sounds interesting to you.

3083
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:24,540
Intuitively. Whether you think that is an interesting topic.

3084
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:26,540
That is the most important thing.

3085
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:28,540
If you, after the pitch meeting,

3086
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:30,540
after the first three minutes,

3087
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:32,540
think that is an interesting topic.

3088
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:34,540
Or that is an important topic

3089
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:36,540
for the industry,

3090
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:38,540
for the society.

3091
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,540
Or just an academically interesting topic.

3092
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:42,540
One that challenges you mentally.

3093
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:44,540
Where you think, oh that is a cool problem.

3094
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:46,540
And I can already imagine how to solve that.

3095
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:48,540
I am interested in

3096
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:50,540
solving that. Because usually

3097
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:52,540
it becomes much more difficult in detail

3098
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:54,540
and then turns out to be completely different.

3099
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,540
But that doesn't matter. You then have this motivation

3100
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:58,540
to fight through it.

3101
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:00,540
That is always the case.

3102
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:02,540
That would be a good occasion.

3103
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:04,540
That you say, that is a cool topic.

3104
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:06,540
I don't know how it works at your university,

3105
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:08,540
but typically it was like that.

3106
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:10,540
You go to a prof and say, what topics do you have?

3107
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:12,540
Then he has a catalog of topics there.

3108
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:14,540
And then you look at them.

3109
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:16,540
Or you have a friend

3110
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:18,540
or you know an engineering company

3111
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:20,540
that would do something like that.

3112
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:22,540
And then you can go to the prof and say,

3113
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:24,540
I have someone here who would do that with me.

3114
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:26,540
And then you can build a connection in that direction as well.

3115
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:28,540
That is actually all relatively chill at the university.

3116
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:32,540
If you find something like that.

3117
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:34,540
The worst are the 0815 topics.

3118
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:38,540
Like, measure here

3119
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:40,540
and write a protocol about it.

3120
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:42,540
And that is your job.

3121
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:44,540
That is a well-earned note.

3122
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:46,540
And that is how they lure people.

3123
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:48,540
Well-earned notes. But you learn almost nothing.

3124
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:50,540
That is alien.

3125
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:52,540
Nobody cares about your results.

3126
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:54,540
And sometimes

3127
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,540
it is like that

3128
02:19:56,540 --> 02:19:58,540
that these quests are

3129
02:19:58,540 --> 02:20:00,540
a real dead-end in my opinion.

3130
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:02,540
That does not lead to anything.

3131
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,540
You miss something

3132
02:20:04,540 --> 02:20:06,540
and then nobody cares

3133
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:08,540
and then it is just shit.

3134
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:10,540
Much better is that you have a concrete problem

3135
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:12,540
and you have to solve it.

3136
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:14,540
Let's say you have a machine

3137
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:16,540
that has an output

3138
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:18,540
and you have another machine

3139
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:20,540
and they have to be connected

3140
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:22,540
and you have to automate something.

3141
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:24,540
You have to optimize a process

3142
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:26,540
or you have to understand

3143
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:28,540
that the interface works

3144
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:30,540
and that the machines can communicate with each other.

3145
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,540
Something like that.

3146
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:34,540
A typical engineer's topic.

3147
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:36,540
That is actually cool.

3148
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,540
And you learn a lot.

3149
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:40,540
You learn something for practice.

3150
02:20:40,540 --> 02:20:42,540
Bus systems,

3151
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:44,540
you have other protocols.

3152
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,540
In general, you learn something about IT.

3153
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:48,540
That comes next.

3154
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:50,540
That is an engineer

3155
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:52,540
who is the most general

3156
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:54,540
of those people who are in practice

3157
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,540
can think outside of the box.

3158
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,540
I do not want to force you to become a programmer

3159
02:20:58,540 --> 02:21:00,540
but I want to make it clear

3160
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:02,540
that if you have something like that

3161
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:04,540
where machines have protocols

3162
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:06,540
where you have to think about

3163
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:08,540
how that works

3164
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:10,540
how signals are processed

3165
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:12,540
then you have to think about

3166
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:14,540
how the world works.

3167
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,540
That is much better and that brings a lot more.

3168
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:18,540
What is written on your paper

3169
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:20,540
that is completely irrelevant

3170
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:22,540
because the heart attack is so strong

3171
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:24,540
that everyone already knows that.

3172
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:26,540
The companies of today see that everywhere.

3173
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:28,540
If you can say in a meeting

3174
02:21:28,540 --> 02:21:30,540
I have clarified this and that

3175
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:32,540
because I am crazy and I put it on me

3176
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:34,540
and besides, lol

3177
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:36,540
then it brings a lot more

3178
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:38,540
because you then go in with your

3179
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:40,540
inflated young man's breast

3180
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:42,540
and say I'm the crazy boy.

3181
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:44,540
That is the elegance that you have to have.

3182
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:46,540
As a physicist, for example, I always have it.

3183
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:50,540
That is the Jedi sword

3184
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:52,540
that I got with my diploma

3185
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:54,540
that I imagine myself

3186
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:56,540
I am so crazy.

3187
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:58,540
With such an elegance

3188
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:00,540
if you go somewhere like that

3189
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:02,540
and say you are the crazy boy

3190
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:04,540
of course people can also think

3191
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:06,540
what kind of a fucking asshole is that

3192
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:08,540
but of course you have to pack it like that

3193
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:10,540
that you are just self-confident.

3194
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:12,540
That is the most important thing.

3195
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:14,540
That's how it is with the wedding show too.

3196
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:16,540
If you make it clear to the woman

3197
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:18,540
that you are a crazy boy

3198
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:20,540
and that you are just self-confident

3199
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:22,540
you get the ices.

3200
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:24,540
You have to shine it out.

3201
02:22:24,540 --> 02:22:26,540
And that only works if you really understand

3202
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:28,540
and stand behind it.

3203
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:30,540
If you stand on a piece of paper

3204
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,540
that you are a great engineer

3205
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:34,540
but you know that what you did there is not worth anything

3206
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:36,540
then it is difficult

3207
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:38,540
to act authentically.

3208
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:40,540
At least that's my impression.

3209
02:22:40,540 --> 02:22:42,540
At least that's my impression.

3210
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:44,540
That people can't do that.

3211
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:46,540
The worst are the guys who think they are the best

3212
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:48,540
but they can't do anything.

3213
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:50,540
Because those are the guys

3214
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:52,540
you ask yourself a question.

3215
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:54,540
I already had conversations with such people.

3216
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:56,540
You ask yourself a very simple question.

3217
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:58,540
What does the Fourier transformation

3218
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:00,540
of Cosinus look like?

3219
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:02,540
And then they can't do that.

3220
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:06,540
And I can only laugh at them

3221
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:08,540
how ridiculous that is.

3222
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:10,540
People like that can go to hell.

3223
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:16,540
I stopped doing Mechatronics

3224
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:18,540
and then I worked as a car mechanic.

3225
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:20,540
I stopped doing Mechatronics

3226
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:22,540
and then I worked as a car mechanic.

3227
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:24,540
Yes, of course.

3228
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:26,540
Why not?

3229
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:28,540
It could be.

3230
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:30,540
It always depends on the personality.

3231
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:32,540
For some it would be better to do it later.

3232
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:34,540
For some it is good

3233
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:36,540
if they do a few years of training.

3234
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:38,540
First training, then studies

3235
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:40,540
or going to the club or whatever.

3236
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:42,540
That would be a classic thing

3237
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:44,540
like what my buddy did.

3238
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:46,540
He was in the club for 6, 7 or 8 years.

3239
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:48,540
But he didn't want to go to the juice shop anymore.

3240
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:50,540
And then he got out

3241
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:52,540
of the good job he had.

3242
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:54,540
He was safe.

3243
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,540
He went out and decided for a happy student life

3244
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:58,540
with little money.

3245
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:00,540
Just because he found it so disgusting.

3246
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:04,540
And now he is still in his job

3247
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:06,540
and has to do a lot more.

3248
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:08,540
He decided to do it

3249
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:10,540
just because he found it better.

3250
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:12,540
Because it is something that

3251
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:14,540
makes him feel closer to himself.

3252
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:16,540
Less alienation.

3253
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:18,540
But looking back

3254
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:20,540
you could

3255
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:22,540
start studying again.

3256
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:24,540
You just have to find

3257
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:26,540
a way to do it in parallel

3258
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:28,540
with the university.

3259
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:30,540
Or to take an education credit

3260
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:32,540
and do it again.

3261
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:34,540
I don't know how it is with BAföG.

3262
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:36,540
If you are 25 now, you will still get BAföG.

3263
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,540
I think BAföG goes up to 30.

3264
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,540
Or does it go up to 25?

3265
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:42,540
I don't know.

3266
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:44,540
You have to work on it.

3267
02:24:44,540 --> 02:24:46,540
Why not study now?

3268
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:58,540
Unfortunately, Titanic

3269
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:00,540
scared me so much. Blood diamond was the first film

3270
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:02,540
that I wanted to watch.

3271
02:25:02,540 --> 02:25:04,540
But that is funny because

3272
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:06,540
Leonardo DiCaprio

3273
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,540
except for Titanic

3274
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:10,540
only made good movies.

3275
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:12,540
He is also a kind of Robert Pattinson.

3276
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:14,540
He was crazy before.

3277
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:16,540
He made many good movies before.

3278
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:18,540
He has the Streets of New York

3279
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:20,540
or something like that.

3280
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:22,540
I don't remember his name.

3281
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:24,540
He was very young.

3282
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:26,540
Then also films like The Beach.

3283
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:28,540
Super cool film.

3284
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:30,540
DiCaprio made a lot of

3285
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:32,540
really good movies.

3286
02:25:32,540 --> 02:25:34,540
And Titanic was...

3287
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:36,540
I grew up with it too.

3288
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:38,540
That is the Titanic.

3289
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:40,540
What kind of shit movie is that?

3290
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:42,540
According to the motto.

3291
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:44,540
He makes a love-homo movie.

3292
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:46,540
He should fuck with his dick stuff.

3293
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:48,540
Sure, that is the mainstream

3294
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:50,540
attitude you get.

3295
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:52,540
But as soon as you have seen The Beach

3296
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:54,540
or James Carroll

3297
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:56,540
was his name.

3298
02:25:56,540 --> 02:25:58,540
Jim Carroll?

3299
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:00,540
Streets of New York or something like that?

3300
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:02,540
One of the first movies.

3301
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:04,540
Only good movies.

3302
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:06,540
Leonardo DiCaprio made almost only good movies.

3303
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:14,540
Yes, that is good

3304
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:16,540
if it is valued on programming

3305
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,540
and signal processing.

3306
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:20,540
Because that is actually

3307
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,540
an engineer who does not do that.

3308
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:24,540
Or who does not develop

3309
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:26,540
any interest for development.

3310
02:26:26,540 --> 02:26:28,540
He is a boomer.

3311
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:30,540
He lives on a dying branch.

3312
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:32,540
That is clear.

3313
02:26:32,540 --> 02:26:34,540
Especially because the engineer

3314
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:36,540
represents the interface between

3315
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:38,540
a real, normal mechanic

3316
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:40,540
and an academic physicist.

3317
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:42,540
That is someone who has the practical

3318
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:44,540
relationship but still understands

3319
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:46,540
the theoretical basics.

3320
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:48,540
At least as far as he needs it

3321
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:50,540
for his problem solving.

3322
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:52,540
It is clear that you cannot

3323
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:54,540
say that the L2-norm

3324
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:56,540
of the function

3325
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:58,540
is smaller than infinite.

3326
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:00,540
That is not expected from you.

3327
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:02,540
You are expected to understand

3328
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:04,540
these things with mathematics

3329
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:06,540
so far as to correctly

3330
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:08,540
classify and solve the problems.

3331
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,540
By the way, you can write me an email.

3332
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:16,540
I like to help people

3333
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:18,540
who are in such a situation.

3334
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:20,540
Because I know myself quite well.

3335
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:22,540
Especially with mathematics.

3336
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:26,540
And if someone is a well-paid

3337
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:28,540
employee of Antifa GmbH

3338
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:30,540
then I already have

3339
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:32,540
a kind of house-sympathy.

3340
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:36,540
To be honest, I did not know

3341
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:38,540
what an in-study

3342
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:40,540
should bring me.

3343
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:42,540
Well, if you say

3344
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:44,540
what did you do?

3345
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:46,540
You worked at a car dealer.

3346
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:48,540
That means you have a lot of practice.

3347
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:50,540
Practice, I assume.

3348
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:52,540
The nice thing about

3349
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:54,540
an academic career is

3350
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,540
the academic

3351
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:58,540
elegance that comes with it.

3352
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:00,540
And I do not mean

3353
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:02,540
that an elitist pisser

3354
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:04,540
comes out of it

3355
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:06,540
and raises you

3356
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:08,540
to another level.

3357
02:28:08,540 --> 02:28:10,540
Because you see

3358
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:12,540
certain things

3359
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:14,540
from a different perspective.

3360
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:16,540
You cannot underestimate

3361
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,540
what that brings.

3362
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:20,540
It brings a lot.

3363
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:22,540
Studying, if you do it

3364
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:24,540
because you feel like it.

3365
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:26,540
I am not talking about all those

3366
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:28,540
weirdos who make inflation

3367
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:30,540
and just want a piece of paper

3368
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,540
so that they are hired at a bank

3369
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:34,540
or get a boss position in a

3370
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:36,540
bureaucratic office.

3371
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:38,540
I am talking about

3372
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:40,540
people who are interested in content.

3373
02:28:40,540 --> 02:28:42,540
And if you say you worked at a car dealer

3374
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:44,540
then I assume you have

3375
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:46,540
a lot of experience.

3376
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:48,540
You know the numbers.

3377
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:50,540
You know the mechanics.

3378
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:52,540
But first of all

3379
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:54,540
I would say that the car

3380
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:56,540
with the combustion engine

3381
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:58,540
is a story

3382
02:28:58,540 --> 02:29:00,540
that is on the dying branch.

3383
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:02,540
But on the other hand

3384
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:04,540
there is much more to discover.

3385
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:06,540
The engineering studio is

3386
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:08,540
a window into a different world.

3387
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,540
You have this application

3388
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:12,540
in your head.

3389
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:14,540
That is mostly the case.

3390
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:16,540
As an engineer you want

3391
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:18,540
to install a milling machine

3392
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:20,540
or you want to become a sports technician

3393
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:22,540
and build fitness equipment.

3394
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:24,540
It does not matter.

3395
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:26,540
You have an idea of what you want to do.

3396
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:28,540
And that is not a problem.

3397
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:30,540
The nice thing is that

3398
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:32,540
through the academic input

3399
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:34,540
that you get

3400
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:36,540
I would say

3401
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:38,540
you see

3402
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:40,540
how it is with modular thinking

3403
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:42,540
and abstract thinking.

3404
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:44,540
That is

3405
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:46,540
an awesome intellectual

3406
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:48,540
level up.

3407
02:29:48,540 --> 02:29:50,540
And nobody can steal it from you.

3408
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:52,540
That is super powerful.

3409
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:54,540
You feel much better afterwards.

3410
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:56,540
It is just

3411
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:58,540
I do not get it wrong.

3412
02:29:58,540 --> 02:30:00,540
I want the activity

3413
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:02,540
of normal people

3414
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:04,540
who did not go to university

3415
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:06,540
and did something right.

3416
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,540
I do not want to talk about that.

3417
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:10,540
As a physicist

3418
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:12,540
I did computer-oriented

3419
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:14,540
theoretical physics

3420
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:16,540
in my graduate school.

3421
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:18,540
I am far away from the practice.

3422
02:30:18,540 --> 02:30:20,540
But I still see that

3423
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:22,540
in engineers.

3424
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:24,540
I know engineers

3425
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:26,540
who are teaching

3426
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:28,540
or doing engineering activities

3427
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,540
and they are crying

3428
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:32,540
how terrible it is

3429
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:34,540
to deal with students

3430
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:36,540
who are only affected by inflation

3431
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:38,540
and so on.

3432
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:40,540
If you want

3433
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:42,540
to do something like that

3434
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:44,540
then do it.

3435
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:46,540
If you do not want to do it

3436
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:48,540
then do it.

3437
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:50,540
If you are interested

3438
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:52,540
in the content

3439
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:54,540
and you learn a lot

3440
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:56,540
even in the inflation

3441
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:58,540
you can learn a lot.

3442
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:00,540
It is not used anymore.

3443
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:02,540
You have to do

3444
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:04,540
30-25%

3445
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,540
of the content.

3446
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:08,540
But you can do 80%.

3447
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:10,540
Nobody can forbid that.

3448
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,540
And nobody can forbid

3449
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:14,540
you to do

3450
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:16,540
secondary literature

3451
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:18,540
if you are interested.

3452
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:20,540
Maybe not statistical physics

3453
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:22,540
but only theoretical mechanics.

3454
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:30,540
It is a nice excursion

3455
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:32,540
if you have the luxury

3456
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:34,540
to do something like that.

3457
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:36,540
I can only recommend it to everyone.

3458
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:38,540
I think it is a real enrichment.

3459
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:40,540
It really helps

3460
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:42,540
to create something.

3461
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:44,540
You can find my e-mail address

3462
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:46,540

3463
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:48,540

Channel info.

3465
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:56,540
I am going to get a beer

3466
02:31:56,540 --> 02:31:58,540
and turn on the music.

3467
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:00,540
We said

3468
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:02,540
hard and relaxed.

3469
02:32:02,540 --> 02:32:04,540
Hard and relaxed.

3470
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:06,540
Hard and relaxed.

3471
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:08,540
I am thinking about

3472
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:10,540
what would be good.

3473
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:12,540
Let me think.

3474
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:18,540
Hard and relaxed.

3475
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:22,540
No.

3476
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:24,540
Maybe.

3477
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:28,540
I have a good idea.

3478
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:30,540
Hard and relaxed.

3479
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:50,540
See you soon.

3480
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:00,540
Thank you.

3481
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:30,540
Thank you.

3482
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:00,540
Thank you.
