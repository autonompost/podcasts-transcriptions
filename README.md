# Podcast Transcriptions

This project contains the transcription files for the podcasts I am listening to.

All podcast audio files are being transcribed with [whisper-autotranscription](https://github.com/autonompost/whisper-autotranscription) with medium model setting. Podcast audio files are being downloaded with [podgrab](https://github.com/akhilrex/podgrab). All audio file names are being sanetized with `detox`.

## Podcasts in this project

I rarely listen to all episodes of a podcast. If you request a podcast that is listed under _Incomplete_, I will potentially add all transcipts here.

### Complete Podcasts

- [Future Histories German/English](./podcasts/futurehistories)

### Incomplete Podcasts

TODO

## Obsidian and Audio Notes

If you are [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) User and want to use the plugin [obsidian-audio-notes](https://github.com/jjmaldonis/obsidian-audio-notes) you will find ready to use notes with embedded Metadata for this plugin.

- [ ] TODO create a script that lets you replace the path inside the audio notes


## Roadmap

- [ ] Summaries for all podcast complete text transcripts
- [ ] English<->German tranlations of complete text transcripts with DeepL Pro
- [ ] Once the DeepL Write API is available also create sanetized versions of complete text transcripts
